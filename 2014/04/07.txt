[2014-04-07 00:23:56] crumb: just a blank line
[2014-04-07 00:24:08] TheRookieLearner: Same :(
[2014-04-07 00:26:53] crumb: too gd weird
[2014-04-07 00:27:05] crumb: since it works for any other url
[2014-04-07 00:27:45] TheRookieLearner: (sigh) <Looses hope in humanity and bangs his head on the wall>
[2014-04-07 00:35:28] crumb: is there a particular reason you're using selenium for this though?
[2014-04-07 00:36:35] TheRookieLearner: Ya. I am having a database of such extensions and I want to get the meatadata of all the extensions in the database.
[2014-04-07 00:36:57] TheRookieLearner: I have like 20000 extensions
[2014-04-07 00:37:04] crumb: you could just as well do scraping
[2014-04-07 00:37:15] crumb: would be more efficient than using a browser
[2014-04-07 00:37:22] TheRookieLearner: Like using requests?
[2014-04-07 00:37:28] crumb: yeah
[2014-04-07 00:38:17] TheRookieLearner: Ya, I know but doing that would require me to write complex regex just to get some specific portion from the entire web page.
[2014-04-07 00:38:42] TheRookieLearner: Plus, if there is a small mistake, I'd have to change my regex
[2014-04-07 00:38:47] crumb: well you already know what portion you need
[2014-04-07 00:39:08] PavanGupta01, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-07 00:39:12] crumb: also, if you don't like regex, there's probably some DOM parser that uses xpath
[2014-04-07 00:40:02] TheRookieLearner: Hmm. Interesting. I have never used a DOM parser.
[2014-04-07 00:40:11] TheRookieLearner: Will give it a  shot.
[2014-04-07 00:40:18] crumb: kk
[2014-04-07 00:40:25] crumb: sorry i couldn't help with selenium though
[2014-04-07 00:40:26] TheRookieLearner: Thanks for your help! :)
[2014-04-07 00:40:31] TheRookieLearner: No problem.
[2014-04-07 00:40:36] crumb: guess it's an anomaly

[2014-04-07 06:35:26] teorias: in last week i came here with a problem "shutdown gracefully" the nodes
[2014-04-07 06:35:34] teorias: so than I can reboot the machines
[2014-04-07 06:35:43] teorias: now, I want to implement this...
[2014-04-07 06:36:13] simonstewart: k
[2014-04-07 06:36:15] teorias: I thought about create a "state" on the defaultremoteproxy called "enabled"
[2014-04-07 06:36:20] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-07 06:36:44] teorias: or, use the "down" variable
[2014-04-07 06:36:59] teorias: so the hub "forget" about that node
[2014-04-07 06:37:29] teorias: and then, do not send more tests to that node, and the node can finish the sessions that already have
[2014-04-07 06:37:34] teorias: and then can gracefully finish
[2014-04-07 06:37:38] teorias: what do you think?

[2014-04-07 07:25:04] teorias: jarib said that I should talk with you
[2014-04-07 07:25:06] nirvdrum: Howdy.
[2014-04-07 07:25:20] teorias: about "gracefully" shutdown nodes
[2014-04-07 07:25:46] nirvdrum: Sure.  What's the question? :-)
[2014-04-07 07:26:05] teorias: ok... First.. There is any away to shutdown gracefully a node?
[2014-04-07 07:26:33] teorias: I mean, "unregister" the node , wait for sessions to be finish, and then system.exit
[2014-04-07 07:26:55] nirvdrum: Sorta.
[2014-04-07 07:27:32] nirvdrum: Let me dig up what I do.
[2014-04-07 07:28:41] teorias: ok... :)
[2014-04-07 07:28:52] nirvdrum: You can send the old RC command to stop the server: http://#{hostname}:#{port}/selenium-server/driver?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
[2014-04-07 07:29:25] nirvdrum: But that will just shutdown Selenium.  I believe it'll stop any sessions currently executing as well.
[2014-04-07 07:29:35] teorias: yup... its not good
[2014-04-07 07:29:37] teorias: :s
[2014-04-07 07:29:41] nirvdrum: So you'd have to monitor your grid and execute it the correct time.
[2014-04-07 07:29:52] teorias: any automatic way to do that?
[2014-04-07 07:29:54] nirvdrum: Otherwise, no, there's no built-in way to do what you want.
[2014-04-07 07:29:58] teorias: ok..
[2014-04-07 07:30:02] teorias: i want to do taht
[2014-04-07 07:30:04] teorias: *that

[2014-04-07 07:30:38] teorias: that if is a false
[2014-04-07 07:30:40] nirvdrum: I agree it's something we should have.  But in practice it's not been a big problem because you can't trust grid reliability anyway.
[2014-04-07 07:30:49] nirvdrum: So anyone running a grid at scale has to have retry logic.
[2014-04-07 07:31:11] teorias: yes, I have that retry logic
[2014-04-07 07:31:21] teorias: but I want to reboot machines every day
[2014-04-07 07:31:29] teorias: but now every node at the same time
[2014-04-07 07:31:33] teorias: *not
[2014-04-07 07:31:35] teorias: but not
[2014-04-07 07:31:42] nirvdrum: I reboot them every 20 min. or so.
[2014-04-07 07:31:52] teorias: all at same time?
[2014-04-07 07:31:59] nirvdrum: Nope.
[2014-04-07 07:32:12] teorias: ok.. so how do you know how to rebooot them ?
[2014-04-07 07:32:21] teorias: you ignore the sessions that are running on the nodes?

[2014-04-07 07:35:04] nirvdrum: And I run that check every 3 minutes.

[2014-04-07 07:36:07] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-07 07:36:21] nirvdrum: So, I unregister to prevent new work from being scheduled on that node, stop Selenium, then reboot.
[2014-04-07 07:36:38] teorias: how do you unregister it?
[2014-04-07 07:37:16] nirvdrum: Let me dig up that code.
[2014-04-07 07:37:30] teorias: if you unregister it, the open sessions will not be lost?
[2014-04-07 07:38:01] nirvdrum: No.  It just tells the hub to stop scheduling new work on it.
[2014-04-07 07:38:11] teorias: fantastic :)
[2014-04-07 07:38:23] nirvdrum: Existing sessions will still be in use.
[2014-04-07 07:38:37] nirvdrum: But, if you have the heartbeat stuff on, the node could re-register itself.
[2014-04-07 07:38:43] nirvdrum: There's a lot of moving parts :-/

[2014-04-07 07:40:58] nirvdrum: teorias: The basic idea on the API is create a servlet that subclasses org.openqa.grid.web.servlet.RegistryBasedServlet.
[2014-04-07 07:41:06] nirvdrum: That gives you access to the grid registry.
[2014-04-07 07:41:37] nirvdrum: Then you can get access to the proxy by something like: val proxy = getRegistry.getAllProxies.getProxyById(id)
[2014-04-07 07:41:50] nirvdrum: And then remove it with something like: getRegistry.removeIfPresent(proxy)
[2014-04-07 07:41:56] teorias: ok
[2014-04-07 07:42:01] nirvdrum: That's Scala, but should map to Java easily enough.
[2014-04-07 07:42:09] nirvdrum: id is a query param I pass to the servlet.
[2014-04-07 07:42:11] teorias: i see that "removeIfpresent"
[2014-04-07 07:42:18] teorias: but there isn't any "url" to do that
[2014-04-07 07:42:21] teorias: right ?
[2014-04-07 07:42:32] nirvdrum: No.  This would be your servlet implementation.

[2014-04-07 07:44:30] teorias: ok :)

[2014-04-07 14:42:52] Frantic: cgoldberg: I might be getting the hang of it, driver.execute looks up the commands in a command list, so I have to add my own command:

[2014-04-07 14:43:06] Frantic: once I do that, I can call it:

[2014-04-07 14:58:51] cgoldberg: ah
[2014-04-07 14:59:03] detronizator: if you want PDF, you might want to use PhantomJS directly

[2014-04-07 14:59:37] detronizator: you can't access the page object
[2014-04-07 14:59:43] detronizator: there are new API in the upcoming release
[2014-04-07 14:59:48] detronizator: that might enable you to do that
[2014-04-07 14:59:54] detronizator: but has not been released yet
[2014-04-07 14:59:56] detronizator: I think...
[2014-04-07 15:00:04] detronizator: let me check: I have done last release a while ago
[2014-04-07 15:00:42] detronizator: actually, you can if you use PhantomJSDriver 1.1.0
[2014-04-07 15:00:47] detronizator: and you build PhantomJS from master
[2014-04-07 15:00:50] detronizator: not the 1.9.7
[2014-04-07 15:01:55] detronizator: scrap that
[2014-04-07 15:02:05] detronizator: I had imported GhostDriver 1.1.0 into 1.9.7
[2014-04-07 15:02:18] detronizator: so, you can do all of that with the current stable releases :)
[2014-04-07 15:02:24] detronizator: sorry for the confusion... I'm tired :)

[2014-04-07 17:31:17] teorias: what you mean?
[2014-04-07 17:32:37] bonJurno: I would like to get pass, fail and needs to be reviewed instead. 3 way logic rather than 2 way true or false
[2014-04-07 17:33:14] coreyg, quitting. (Quit: coreyg)
[2014-04-07 17:34:13] bonJurno: Thought about using Boolean rather than boolean as it has true false and null. Just don't know what to change in the source
[2014-04-07 17:34:40] teorias: well, maybe here someone can help you, but I haven't knowledges to help you
[2014-04-07 17:34:59] teorias: however, I think that any "failed" test… should be reviewed :-P
[2014-04-07 17:35:15] teorias: testng have also de "skip" state
[2014-04-07 17:35:52] bonJurno: np thanks anyway. Ya I know that this is more to feed into the custom html reporter I made
[2014-04-07 17:36:09] bonJurno: so they show up green orange and red
[2014-04-07 17:36:22] bonJurno: green and red are pass and fail
[2014-04-07 17:38:19] teorias: when will a test be marked as "need to be reviewed" ?
