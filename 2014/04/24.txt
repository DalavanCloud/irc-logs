I am coding in python and i just need to read all requests and responses with their headers. Is it easier to define an interceptor for browsermob for this or just get the HAR and search for the relevant information needed? thanks

[2014-04-24 08:39:43] sircapsalot: usually you'd save a 'baseUrl' upon your first navigation.
[2014-04-24 08:39:59] WhereIsMySpoon: sure I have that anyway
[2014-04-24 08:40:03] WhereIsMySpoon: its extra keys to press
[2014-04-24 08:40:04] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-04-24 08:40:17] sircapsalot: then you can do driver.navigateTo().url(baseUrl + "/blah.html")

[2014-04-24 08:40:51] dude-x: when webdriver fails to find an element because of the DOM is being mutated, and despite using a webdriver wait, what is the mechanism that is causing the failure, in the general sense?
[2014-04-24 08:41:02] sircapsalot: nope.
[2014-04-24 08:41:32] dude-x: is it because javascript is blocking the webdriver extension? is it because webdriver is working on a particular cache of the DOM
[2014-04-24 08:41:38] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: if you want to do that, use a fluent wait
[2014-04-24 08:41:42] WhereIsMySpoon: rather than a webdriver wait
[2014-04-24 08:42:02] dude-x: webdriver wait is a fluent wait in the java code
[2014-04-24 08:42:27] WhereIsMySpoon: they arent the same thing
[2014-04-24 08:42:58] dude-x: i know how to wait for elements in general; but this is more about documenting to my coworkers why this failure occurs
[2014-04-24 08:43:02] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-04-24 08:43:12] sircapsalot: do you use the PageObject pattern?
[2014-04-24 08:43:19] dude-x: of course

[2014-04-24 08:43:38] dude-x: i am just trying to explain why tests are flaky
[2014-04-24 08:43:51] dude-x: i want to say more than "when the DOM is mutating, and webdriver wants to get an element, it may not work in some cases"
[2014-04-24 08:44:06] sircapsalot: that's why then.  you need to account for those mutations, and detect when whatevers doing it, is done.  then yo uneed to reload those PageObject's
[2014-04-24 08:44:24] WhereIsMySpoon: ive not seen this pageobject thing
[2014-04-24 08:44:35] WhereIsMySpoon: interesting
[2014-04-24 08:44:35] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-24 08:44:35] dude-x: page object is just an abstraction
[2014-04-24 08:44:41] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-04-24 08:44:47] sircapsalot: because, obviously upon the PageObject's initialization, they were pointing to the original DOM rather than the updated one.
[2014-04-24 08:45:36] admc, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-04-24 08:45:43] dude-x: however the java code has a page object factory which is a different beast

From what I've seen, those exceptions are thrown on a different thread.  I'm asking because some Javascript Alert windows are being shown that my code is unable to respond to before it throws an UnhandledAlertException.
