[2014-04-21 07:18:25] _ramok: ?
[2014-04-21 07:18:39] jimevans: _ramok: thousands of tests daily.
[2014-04-21 07:19:01] jimevans: (depending on how you define "successfully")
[2014-04-21 07:19:20] jimevans: but, yes, our tests execute against chrome, using the chromedriver.
[2014-04-21 07:21:42] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-21 07:23:16] _ramok: jimevans: perfect. are you using xvfb for running it?
[2014-04-21 07:23:21] jimevans: nope
[2014-04-21 07:23:25] jimevans: never tried to
[2014-04-21 07:23:31] _ramok: so you're on a windows machine?
[2014-04-21 07:23:47] jimevans: i've used windows and linux.
[2014-04-21 07:24:05] jimevans: but our automatic build and test environment uses windows VMs yes.\
[2014-04-21 07:24:14] _ramok: jimevans: good. what is your setup on linux?
[2014-04-21 07:24:25] jimevans: not sure what you mean?
[2014-04-21 07:24:36] _ramok: for some reason, i cannot get my automated integration tests running on ubuntu 12.04  with the chromedriver
[2014-04-21 07:24:59] jimevans: okay. "not working" is remarkably vague.
[2014-04-21 07:25:22] _ramok: sure, for some reason i can't instantiate the chromedriver. i always get an unspecified exception without a stacktrace
[2014-04-21 07:25:35] jimevans: can you launch the executable manually?
[2014-04-21 07:25:37] _ramok: and now i'm looking for someone with a similar setup as i have on my ubuntu machine
[2014-04-21 07:25:46] _ramok: jimevans: you mean as a jenkins user?
[2014-04-21 07:25:48] _ramok: yes i can
[2014-04-21 07:26:12] jimevans: okay, can you run the tests manually (not using jenkins)?
[2014-04-21 07:26:53] _ramok: jimevans: oh, i'm not sure how to. the tests are written in java and are in the repository
[2014-04-21 07:27:02] _ramok: should i check them out and run a maven command?

[2014-04-21 07:27:33] jimevans: that would probably be a good first step.

[2014-04-21 07:27:58] jimevans: you've got a lot of moving parts here.
[2014-04-21 07:28:38] jimevans: not only the chromedriver executable, and your webdriver code, you also have maven, and jenkins, and whatever test runner (junit, testng, etc) you've chosen.

[2014-04-21 10:06:10] roymiloh: well, you send a requesnt, what then?
[2014-04-21 10:06:14] roymiloh: request*
[2014-04-21 10:06:29] lukeis: the driver performs that request
[2014-04-21 10:06:36] lukeis: and sends a response

[2014-04-21 10:07:13] lukeis: it's just a json blob in the response to the original http request
[2014-04-21 10:07:13] roymiloh: I'm sending a request to get an element by id, ok, but what the response?
[2014-04-21 10:07:52] roymiloh: do you have any example?

[2014-04-21 10:08:52] lukeis: not sure what you're doing… usually you don't need to care about the JSON http requests unless you're implementing a client side driver
[2014-04-21 10:09:38] roymiloh: lukeis: well, not doint something special, just wanna know how it work. I have read the client docs, but there is no information about the response

[2014-04-21 10:13:52] lukeis: depends on the request
[2014-04-21 10:13:52] jleyba: {"status": 0, "value": 123}
[2014-04-21 10:14:10] jleyba: it's just a application/json;charset=utf-8 HTTP message
[2014-04-21 10:14:26] roymiloh: yes I know, but how this json helps me?
[2014-04-21 10:14:34] lukeis: for find_element it looks like:  {"status":0, "value":{"ELEMENT":":wd:UUID"} }
[2014-04-21 10:14:35] roymiloh: if I click on element, what then?
[2014-04-21 10:14:49] lukeis: you'll get a status response
[2014-04-21 10:14:59] roymiloh: what is that we:UUID?
[2014-04-21 10:15:04] jleyba: If you're using WebDriver, you shouldn't concern yourself with the raw responses.  Just consider that an implementation detail
[2014-04-21 10:15:11] lukeis: a UUID, generated by the driver
[2014-04-21 10:15:15] roymiloh: the statsu I understood, but the value is confusing
[2014-04-21 10:15:18] jleyba: The client libraries should handle translating it to something more meaningful
[2014-04-21 10:15:27] lukeis: what he said ^
[2014-04-21 10:15:54] roymiloh: client libraries you mean the client I work with such as webdriverjs?
[2014-04-21 10:16:03] lukeis: yes
[2014-04-21 10:16:05] roymiloh: not the chromerdriver etc
[2014-04-21 10:16:12] jleyba: Right
[2014-04-21 10:16:18] roymiloh: ok. great.
[2014-04-21 10:16:21] roymiloh: one last question
[2014-04-21 10:16:24] jimevans: roymiloh: there are two cases here. either (1) you're writing a client binding, in which case, you care about the raw response value, and you really should read the spec; or (2) you're using an already existing client binding, in which case you shouldn't care about it.
[2014-04-21 10:17:11] jimevans: s/shouldn't care about it/should consider it an implementation detail and the client binding should make it more meaningful/
[2014-04-21 10:18:13] roymiloh: jimevans: yeah, I know, I'm not going to write a client, I'm using it. just wondered how it works.
[2014-04-21 10:18:25] lukeis: roymiloh: if you're using http://webdriver.io/  I would highly HIGHLY recommend using a different javascript library
[2014-04-21 10:18:37] roymiloh: now about the last question - what is the seesionId which is sent as the response?
[2014-04-21 10:18:38] lukeis: since they do a very poor job in abstracting the wire protocol

[2014-04-21 10:18:52] roymiloh: lukeis: I'm using the official from google code

[2014-04-21 10:19:07] lukeis: that one ^ i hope :)
[2014-04-21 10:19:10] jimevans: usually, when someone asks how it works, and they're deeply into the workings of the wire protocol, and they're using an existing language binding, that means the language bindings are poorly written.
[2014-04-21 10:19:13] roymiloh: yes
[2014-04-21 10:19:18] lukeis: they both have the same name unfortunately
[2014-04-21 10:19:43] jleyba: they pushed to npm first and stole the name. the official one has been called webdriverjs since at least 2007
[2014-04-21 10:19:49] jimevans: and they're usually having a problem, and thinking a broader understanding of the wire protocol will help solve that problem, when in reality, that's rarely the case.
[2014-04-21 10:19:50] jleyba: not that i'm bitter or anything
[2014-04-21 10:19:53] lukeis: ;)
[2014-04-21 10:20:00] lukeis: i let them know they 'stole' it
[2014-04-21 10:20:32] jleyba: roymiloh: are you having problems with webdriverjs?
[2014-04-21 10:20:52] roymiloh: is the code in google developed by the official selenium's developers (you?)?
[2014-04-21 10:21:08] lukeis: yes ;) (namely him ^)
[2014-04-21 10:21:14] roymiloh: jleyba: actaully no, it works just fine.
[2014-04-21 10:21:33] jleyba: i wrote/maintain the .js client library.  jimevans wrote/maintains the .net client
[2014-04-21 10:21:43] *jimevans doesn't want to be the guy that discourages people from understanding the inner workings of the project, but trying to understand those inner workings "just because" isn't generally useful.'
[2014-04-21 10:21:49] lukeis: and i'm just a loud mouth who gets in the way ;)

[2014-04-21 10:25:32] jleyba: tells the server what browser the command is for
[2014-04-21 10:26:16] jleyba: but sometimes there is a 1:1 relationship between server and browser sessions though (e.g. FirefoxDriver)
[2014-04-21 10:26:39] lukeis: unless it's through the standalone server or grid
[2014-04-21 10:27:08] sircapsalot: sorry, from the TestSlot class**
[2014-04-21 10:27:16] roymiloh: I mean when using standalone server
[2014-04-21 10:28:00] lukeis: the standalone server uses it to route the request to the correct browser instance
[2014-04-21 10:28:13] lukeis: (you can run multiple FF and chrome on a single machine)
[2014-04-21 10:29:00] roymiloh: oh

[2014-04-21 11:27:38] kallisti: jimevans: ah okay. Was just curious if you make use of any of the newish async primitives.
[2014-04-21 11:28:22] jimevans: kallisti: no, we have to support down-level versions of the framework.
[2014-04-21 11:29:30] kallisti: Ah, that's a shame. I'm working on a distributed game of life implementation for a class project, and I'm finding them very useful.
[2014-04-21 11:29:41] kallisti: so you probably use BeginReceive/BeginRead and friends
[2014-04-21 11:30:06] farlan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-21 11:30:18] jimevans: no, not really. everything from the client bindings' perspective is synchronous.
[2014-04-21 11:31:00] jimevans: so there's no need to complicate things by invoking the async versions of those methods.
[2014-04-21 11:31:01] kallisti: oh, duh, it's all HTTP. :P  async would be the server-side code.
[2014-04-21 11:31:05] jimevans: yes.
[2014-04-21 11:31:25] jimevans: now if you look at the strontium project, *that* uses beginreceive and so on.
[2014-04-21 11:31:54] jimevans: i have a bit more control over how that works, so i'll likely migrate that to using async/await someday.
[2014-04-21 11:32:13] jimevans: and the windows phone driver uses async/await also.
[2014-04-21 11:33:33] kallisti: I've been using TaskCompletionSource a bit for custom async stuff, but for some reason people on StackOverflow say to avoid it. Not really sure why...

[2014-04-21 12:39:22] nirvdrum: Feels very similar to an old SafariDriver issue in fact.

[2014-04-21 12:44:30] nirvdrum: So the browser tries to cross protected mode boundaries for some call and then kill the communication as a security precaution?
[2014-04-21 12:45:28] jimevans: yeah. it's the same reason we force protected mode settings to be the same for all zones, because when you cross a boundary, you get a new process, and your COM objects get orphaned.
[2014-04-21 12:45:51] jimevans: except the difference is that with BFCache enabled, you can cross the boundary even if you have the zones set to the same value.

[2014-04-21 12:50:32] lukeis: well, you could be setting some preferences differently
[2014-04-21 12:50:45] myndzi: (e.g. not committing to database or whatever)

[2014-04-21 12:52:46] dude-x: firefox will usually default to native events off, where a click is javascript code telling it to act as if it's clicked

[2014-04-21 12:54:16] myndzi: okay
[2014-04-21 12:54:31] myndzi: so xvfb fakes an x environment so you don't have to actually install x?
[2014-04-21 12:54:46] myndzi: letting the browser run as though it's got an actual window environment to execute in
[2014-04-21 12:55:11] myndzi: which seems like the slow route, but i'll take it over a really old browser implementation :P
[2014-04-21 12:55:15] dude-x: xvfb might require X but it doesn't render to screen
[2014-04-21 12:55:22] smccarthy: jimevans: regarding 6511, do I have to add the FEATURE_BFCACHE folder under Feature Control? Or should it already be there? I don't have the folder currently on my win7 IE11 node
[2014-04-21 12:55:34] jimevans: if it's not there, add it.
[2014-04-21 12:55:34] myndzi: thanks for the clarifications guys
[2014-04-21 12:55:43] dude-x: xvfb does have a framebuffer so you can still get screenshots
[2014-04-21 12:56:11] smccarthy: Ok, and does it matter if I want to use the 32 or 64 bit of IE? Or does it only matter about the OS version (64 vs 32bit) ?
[2014-04-21 12:56:43] jimevans: OS version is all that matters. you don't get a choice what bit-ness of IE you get with IE10+
[2014-04-21 12:56:51] smccarthy: ok thx
[2014-04-21 12:57:09] dude-x: for ie8-9 you would want to run 32 bit because javascript has a JIT
[2014-04-21 12:57:44] jimevans: for IE10 and 11, you always get a mix of 64-bit and 32-bit IE on x64 windows.
[2014-04-21 12:58:02] jimevans: (oversimplification, but true for the vast majority of cases)

[2014-04-21 13:00:07] sircapsalot: :D
[2014-04-21 13:01:03] sircapsalot: zack_ a typical setup would be a jenkins build pulling from your git repository, which builds, then using maven, you'd run tests.  you can of course use other CI's, dependency management solutions, etc
[2014-04-21 13:01:26] zack_: sircapsalot:  the only thing about jenkins is that i hate it and it's java and seems challenging to setup, configure & maintain
[2014-04-21 13:01:49] sircapsalot: any CI is like that, minus maybe the java part
[2014-04-21 13:02:26] zack_: what other CIs do you recommend?
[2014-04-21 13:02:33] sircapsalot: what's your project?

[2014-04-21 13:02:50] zack_: test suite is ruby though
[2014-04-21 13:02:58] sircapsalot: then i'd recommend travis.ci if you want one up quick

[2014-04-21 13:07:01] cgoldberg: zack_, , for a small project, setting up your own Jenkins is super easy.. Maintenance is pretty easy also.  just beware if you have lots of projects it can get overwhelming, and a service like travis is nice
[2014-04-21 13:07:24] zack_: i'm checking out travis-ci.com
[2014-04-21 13:08:40] sircapsalot: cgoldberg: that statement is definitely debatable.  :)
[2014-04-21 13:08:58] cgoldberg: which part
[2014-04-21 13:09:15] zack_: one thing to do would just change the 'Makefile' to run the test suite against the appropriate environment after each deploy
[2014-04-21 13:09:22] cgoldberg: setting up Jenkins, or maintenance?
[2014-04-21 13:09:43] zack_: it would be just a little annoying since the tests would run serially from local machine

[2014-04-21 13:48:18] lukeis: no, that was much more recent

[2014-04-21 13:48:39] kallisti: well, I was using 2.33 as a reference.
[2014-04-21 13:48:48] kallisti: as that's the most recent version I've looked at
[2014-04-21 13:48:51] lukeis: 2.41 it was added :)
[2014-04-21 13:48:58] sevaseva, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-21 13:49:21] kallisti: oh I didn't know about this changelog
[2014-04-21 13:49:21] lukeis: only implemented in FF from what I understand
[2014-04-21 13:49:29] lukeis: read the Java one ;)
[2014-04-21 13:50:28] kallisti: Fixed capabilities to be sent properly encoded. For instance, capabilities for mobile have copyright signs.

[2014-04-21 13:59:40] kallisti: I mean, there's javascript Date
[2014-04-21 14:00:06] dude-x: so i guess Java can now cast it to a Date object
[2014-04-21 14:00:06] kallisti: I'll run some tests to see how it's encoded

[2014-04-21 18:12:58] WillPittenger: I'm trying to get text inside a span marked with "visibility: hidden".  getText() just returns an empty string.  Is there an alternative?  Something like the innerText JavaScript property would help.
