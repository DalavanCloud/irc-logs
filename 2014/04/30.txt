[2014-04-30 09:25:12] lukeis: maybe ;)
[2014-04-30 09:25:21] WhereIsMySpoon: There's no fundamental problem with returning a WebElement that is an <option> element that was gotten from a Select that was created in the same method we're returning from is there? Because I'm getting a stale element reference when trying to return one :S
[2014-04-30 09:25:39] WhereIsMySpoon: im not even trying to interact with it, only return it
[2014-04-30 09:25:46] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont understand why this would throw a stale element reference ex
[2014-04-30 09:27:05] lukeis: i don't understand your question… sample code speaks louder than words ;) (and is the Select dynamically altered with javascript?)

[2014-04-30 09:27:57] WhereIsMySpoon: and no
[2014-04-30 09:28:03] WhereIsMySpoon: very simple function
[2014-04-30 09:28:46] lukeis: the stale is coming from the Select element
[2014-04-30 09:29:04] lukeis: you are likely getting the Select from a previous page or it's currently being re-rendered
[2014-04-30 09:29:12] WhereIsMySpoon: nope, same page
[2014-04-30 09:29:16] WhereIsMySpoon: no re-rendering
[2014-04-30 09:29:29] lukeis: i'm skeptical :)
[2014-04-30 09:29:47] lukeis: i'd need to see more code / see the page ;)
[2014-04-30 09:29:48] Dave_B_: selecting from a select sometimes results in a change to the parent as the list gets 'pushed up'
[2014-04-30 09:30:04] lukeis: this is before even selecting anything
[2014-04-30 09:30:09] Dave_B_: oh
[2014-04-30 09:30:17] WhereIsMySpoon: no it isnt
[2014-04-30 09:30:21] WhereIsMySpoon: its after the selectbyindex
[2014-04-30 09:30:25] WhereIsMySpoon: literally on the return line
[2014-04-30 09:30:27] Dave_B_: the snippet selects before the StaleElementReference is thrown
[2014-04-30 09:30:40] lukeis: it's the equivalent of  driver.find_element_by_tag_name("select").find_elements_by_tag_name("option")
[2014-04-30 09:30:53] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: the second find is where the stale is coming from
[2014-04-30 09:31:02] lukeis: a .get() of an index would not do it
[2014-04-30 09:31:20] WhereIsMySpoon: ah i know what i can do
[2014-04-30 09:31:32] WhereIsMySpoon: i can just store el.getOptions() before i call selectByIndex
[2014-04-30 09:31:34] Dave_B_: if a is stale then a.anything would do it I thought
[2014-04-30 09:31:38] WhereIsMySpoon: then return from there
[2014-04-30 09:31:55] lukeis: Dave_B_: true… but his sample code shows that ^
[2014-04-30 09:32:45] Dave_B_: WhereIsMySpoon: That'll do it :)
[2014-04-30 09:32:45] WhereIsMySpoon: yea that seems to have done it
[2014-04-30 09:32:59] farlan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-30 09:33:01] WhereIsMySpoon: makes sense to do it that way
[2014-04-30 09:33:15] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe my selectbyindex changed the select element
[2014-04-30 09:33:25] WhereIsMySpoon: then i do getoptions and return a completely different option to the one that i selected
[2014-04-30 09:33:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-04-30 09:33:34] WhereIsMySpoon: safer and not prone to exceptions this way
[2014-04-30 09:33:40] Dave_B_: :)
[2014-04-30 09:35:44] lukeis: very much sounds like there's some javascript trickery on your page
[2014-04-30 09:37:23] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: oh most certainly
[2014-04-30 09:37:33] WhereIsMySpoon: such javascript
[2014-04-30 09:37:37] WhereIsMySpoon: all the time
[2014-04-30 09:37:39] WhereIsMySpoon: :<
[2014-04-30 09:40:30] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: just so you know, your method is slightly incorrect… read the java doc… https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.java#L164    getOptions().get(x)  could possible be a different option than the one clicked on by Select.selectByIndex(x)
[2014-04-30 09:40:47] lukeis: i only point this out since you may encounter that with javascripty pages ;)
[2014-04-30 09:42:14] lukeis: (and really if the select is "multiple")

[2014-04-30 09:51:28] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: surely if the elements are in a specific order, getOptions (ive seen the source) should get them in that order?
[2014-04-30 09:51:36] nirvdrum: ato: my apologies then.
[2014-04-30 09:51:37] WhereIsMySpoon: which would be the indexed order

[2014-04-30 09:56:21] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: oh, this is only a problem when the select supports multiple selections?

[2014-04-30 11:11:34] jleyba: how often do people find platform specific bugs with WebDriver?

[2014-04-30 11:12:17] ato: jleyba: When we used WebDriver to test Presto we would find those occasionally.
[2014-04-30 11:12:17] monbro: sircapsalot: yes and then my test is failing with ‘UnknownError: unknown error: undefined is not a function’
[2014-04-30 11:12:24] ato: jleyba: (But that's a rather specific use case.)
[2014-04-30 11:12:29] monbro: but actually I want to test that the response is 401
[2014-04-30 11:12:43] jleyba: monbro: out of scope for WebDriver. use a basic HTTP client

[2014-04-30 12:19:10] jimevans: MalekAlrwily: what version of selenium are you using? the AndroidDriver classes were deprecated and removed from the project awhile back.
[2014-04-30 12:22:15] pawell: Hi, there are more then one way to get element with webdriver. Which one is better and why ? I would be thankful for answer
[2014-04-30 12:23:04] MalekAlrwily, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2014-04-30 12:23:36] sircapsalot: pawell: findElement() returns only one instance of WebElement, and findElements() return a list.  Neither is *better* than the other, they have their different uses, it might be noteworthy to say though, that findElement() will fail if the element doesn't exist, so findElements() is more useful if validating that elements are *not* present.
[2014-04-30 12:23:43] jimevans: pawell: in what sense? i don't think of any location strategy as "better" than another.
[2014-04-30 12:24:18] pawell: Ok. Thank you for your answers
[2014-04-30 12:24:55] jimevans: pawell: i don't know that i answered your question. i'm interested more in the reasons you're asking.
[2014-04-30 12:25:43] sircapsalot: pawell: If what you meant was which locator strategy to use, then refer to what jimevans had said.  though, i must say i'm biased towards CSS because it's cleaner :)
[2014-04-30 12:26:05] sircapsalot: "input#username" as opposed to "//input[@id='username']"

[2014-04-30 12:44:46] smccarthy: whats a good way to get an element that doesn't have a specific attribute (for IE9) ? I tried div[class*='contact']:not([style]) , but it fails on IE9 and passes on IE10. I tried looking for some compatibility css stuff, and found http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selectors/ , but even that mentioned :not as being compatible with IE9
[2014-04-30 12:45:43] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-30 12:48:13] jimevans: smccarthy: that site is pretty good when it comes to accuracy, but are you sure the browser is rendering the page using IE9 document mode? if not, it'll fall back to whatever css selectors are properly supported by the document mode it's rendering in.
[2014-04-30 12:49:28] smccarthy: jimevans: its set to Internet Explorer Compatibility View mode.
[2014-04-30 12:49:31] smccarthy: oh
[2014-04-30 12:49:37] smccarthy: i see document mode IE8
[2014-04-30 12:49:38] smccarthy: lol
[2014-04-30 12:49:40] smccarthy: thanks !
[2014-04-30 12:49:57] jimevans: :)
[2014-04-30 12:50:38] smccarthy: should browser mode be IE9 Compat View ? or just IE9 ?
[2014-04-30 12:50:58] jimevans: depends on the document.
[2014-04-30 12:51:01] dude-x: smccarthy: use xpath
[2014-04-30 12:51:09] aCodinMan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-30 12:51:26] smccarthy: dude-x: xpath failed too
[2014-04-30 12:51:37] jimevans: specifically, IE renders using the document mode it thinks is right by examining the doctype (among other things)
[2014-04-30 12:51:52] dude-x: if the locator is different because of ie9/ie10 differences
[2014-04-30 12:52:07] dude-x: then you will have to account for that
[2014-04-30 12:52:12] jimevans: and gives you no way to programmatically say "use this document mode" (so there's no way to specify it using the IE driver)
[2014-04-30 12:53:11] sircapsalot: ok, here's my crazy idea of the day… we go oldschool, and use our own CSS engine, so we can use :contains() and :nth()….
[2014-04-30 12:53:27] jimevans: ugh. dear god, please no.
[2014-04-30 12:53:32] lukeis: ......
[2014-04-30 12:53:35] sircapsalot: HA
[2014-04-30 12:54:11] lukeis: for the :contains zealots, they can inject sizzle and have their own By.sizzle selector (there's blogs out there on how to do it)
[2014-04-30 12:54:26] jimevans: you're welcome to do that in your own implementation. using javascript execution makes it really easy to inject a js implementation like sizzle
[2014-04-30 12:54:47] dude-x: if your site uses jQuery you can leverage that to find an element
[2014-04-30 12:55:09] dude-x: backbone uses a bit of jquery
[2014-04-30 12:55:52] jimevans: i, for one, want no part in creating and maintaining a (potentially) non-standard css selector engine, with all of the corner and edge cases that implies, which, by definition, won't be the same engine used by the browser itself, so is likely to contain subtle differences in results.
[2014-04-30 12:56:54] sircapsalot: hence the crazy idea.. :)  i do hope they bring that back.. pretty sure i read something in the spec that they were implementing it named differently
[2014-04-30 12:57:31] jimevans: i really hope they don't bring it back.
[2014-04-30 12:57:41] sircapsalot: what's your opposition?
[2014-04-30 12:57:46] jimevans: it has nothing to do with the mission of css selectors.
[2014-04-30 12:58:04] jimevans: css is all about *presentation*. it should have nothing to do with the *content*
[2014-04-30 12:59:28] sircapsalot: the original implementation was designed for presenting elements that contained certain text.. i agree fundamentally that it's bad practice (which is why they took it out) but it sure as hell makes my job simpler… i'm indifferent, i just wanted to start some discussions

[2014-04-30 13:09:27] jimevans: sircapsalot: that's fine, but it doesn't help switch focus back to the previously-focused frame.
[2014-04-30 13:09:28] pixelport: thanks i will just save the frame by my own
[2014-04-30 13:10:12] sircapsalot: jimevans nope, that'll have to be managed by you.. once you use defaultContent() you need to switch back to your original frame
