[2014-04-20 00:11:44] abotalov: I'm trying to add support for "maximize" to Capybara (a wrapper for Ruby binding). As part of doing it I should make it working at Travis CI. "maximize" doesn't work in Xvfb without window manager so I try to use fluxbox/jwm/icewm. Maximize seems to work with them but I would expect "window.outerHeight" to be equal to "window.screen.availHeight" which is not true when using those window managers. Should I check height not-exactly but approximately.
