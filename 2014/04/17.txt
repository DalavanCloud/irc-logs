[2014-04-17 08:00:00] smyers: The internet explorer driver isn't on par with firefox or chrome, for example, so if you were considering it I'd recommend at least prototyping on firefox, say, before bring in the IE driver.

[2014-04-17 08:05:14] Dave_B_: given what he is looking at doing isn't cross-browser testing he can probably skip IE altogether, and avoid having to ask questions that'll reveal how terrible a coder the guy who wrote IE driver is :)

[2014-04-17 08:07:24] raboof: when using the firefox webdriver in 2.41, it appears the 'open' call returns more quickly than it used to for URL's that contain a # - does that ring a bell for anyone?
[2014-04-17 08:07:46] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-17 08:09:37] lukeis: webdriver doesn't have an "open" call.  RC does.
[2014-04-17 08:11:37] raboof: ah, sorry, it's a "get" call on the FirefoxDriver (called from com.thoughtworks.selenium.webdriven.commands.Open in my case)
[2014-04-17 08:11:50] lukeis: that's RC ;)
[2014-04-17 08:11:59] lukeis: com.thoughtworks….. is RC
[2014-04-17 08:12:16] raboof: yes, but for this call it simply directly calls 'get' on the WebDriver
[2014-04-17 08:12:19] lukeis: you *might* be using WebDriverBackedSelenium?
[2014-04-17 08:12:39] lukeis: or even worse… SeleniumBackedWebDriver

[2014-04-17 08:15:43] raboof: that's kind of besides the point though - my problem is the 'get' call on FirefoxDriver (which is just the generic get from RemoteWebDriver) returns before the page is actually loaded
[2014-04-17 08:15:43] lukeis: oh thank god, seleniumBackedWebDriver was removed ;)
[2014-04-17 08:16:07] lukeis: it's not besides the point when i'm trying to understand what mechanism you're using
[2014-04-17 08:16:15] jimevans: lukeis: once we got a (mostly) working safari driver, there was no longer any need for seleniumbackedwebdriver.
[2014-04-17 08:16:28] lukeis: yep, that's what I thought :)
[2014-04-17 08:17:50] raboof: lukeis: the mechanism I'm using is Xebium, which calls WebDriverCommandProcessor and (in this case) FirefoxDriver
[2014-04-17 08:18:33] lukeis: ok… then can you confirm the # isn't getting stripped off with the conversion to new URL(url).toString() ?
[2014-04-17 08:18:43] lukeis: cause that could be a bug in there...
[2014-04-17 08:19:15] raboof: i can confirm that, as the page eventually loads correctly
[2014-04-17 08:19:50] lukeis: and you say there is different behavior between 2.40 and 2.41?

[2014-04-17 09:46:45] jimevans: it galls me that an entirely incorrect answer has a higher score than the correct one.
[2014-04-17 09:47:11] jimevans: and not only incorrect, but condescendingly written ("are just too lazy")

[2014-04-17 09:48:45] sircapsalot: jimevans: correct me if i'm wrong, WebDriver just doesn't recognize the difference between tabs and windows.  You can still switch to tabs
[2014-04-17 09:49:23] jimevans: sircapsalot: consider yourself corrected. if the driver doesn't support switching to tabs, you can't switch to it.
[2014-04-17 09:51:18] teorias, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-17 09:51:34] jimevans: but in theory, you're right, all top-level browsing contexts (whether in a tab or a separate window) should be treated the same by webdriver.

[2014-04-17 09:53:49] jimevans: but i can say with absolute certainty that if you attempt to employ a workaround with the IE driver to open a link in a new tab instead of a new window, the behavior is undefined and unsupported. it probably won't work; goody for you if it does. but if it doesn't, you're entirely out of luck.
[2014-04-17 09:54:25] lagweezle, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-17 09:54:36] jimevans: (and i can say that with absolute certainty in no small part because i get to make the rules for the IE driver [at least for now])
[2014-04-17 09:55:04] smyers: That an interesting one. The question is basically "does webdriver support tabs?", and the upvoted answer is "Yes, with javascript, by injecting shit into the dom and we're lucky it works..."
[2014-04-17 09:55:08] smyers: This makes me sad.
[2014-04-17 09:55:15] sircapsalot: what is this… RC?
[2014-04-17 09:56:30] lukeis: i wish it was RC… ;)
[2014-04-17 09:56:51] lagweezle: It is looking like https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1934 should not be marked as Fixed, unless there is a newer version of it that should be tracking things...?
[2014-04-17 09:56:54] sircapsalot: question though… jimevans, is this IE specific? because if I click a target='_blank' in chrome, it default opens in a new tab, and i can switch to it just fine
[2014-04-17 09:56:57] lukeis: had previously up voted jimevans… now i just down voted the other ;)
[2014-04-17 09:57:27] smyers: Oh yeah, we can downvote, too
[2014-04-17 09:57:32] smyers: Amazing.
[2014-04-17 09:57:48] jimevans: sircapsalot: dunno, don't care. the answer is "the api doesn't support forcing tabs"

[2014-04-17 09:59:01] jimevans: note i do *not* endorse downvoting the other answer. if you want to, go ahead, but i'm more interested in helping the proverbial "cream rise to the top"
[2014-04-17 09:59:23] lukeis: it showed up on the top for me
[2014-04-17 09:59:28] lukeis: your answer that is
[2014-04-17 09:59:31] sircapsalot: ^
[2014-04-17 09:59:41] jimevans: that's because it's the "accepted" answer.
[2014-04-17 10:00:10] jimevans: (and, btw, it happens to be correct too)
[2014-04-17 10:00:14] jimevans: :)
[2014-04-17 10:00:24] smyers: I do think the other answer is not useful, fwiw, hence the downvote.
[2014-04-17 10:00:33] lukeis: lagweezle: why do you think it should be re-opened?
[2014-04-17 10:00:46] smyers: Going the route recommended there will eventually lead to pain.
[2014-04-17 10:00:57] *jimevans is cranky because he can only consume clear liquids today and that the definition of "clear liquids" doesn't include alcohol'

[2014-04-17 10:01:49] lagweezle: lukeis: While not terribly useful, many of the comments suggests the issue continues after the fix was put in.

[2014-04-17 10:02:36] lagweezle: lukeis: Part of that being a question, as I appear to be suffering from some of the same symptoms. Remote WebDriver, Firefox, /tmp/anonymous###...###webdriver-profile backing up.
[2014-04-17 10:03:00] lukeis: have you ensured you are calling driver.quit() ?
[2014-04-17 10:04:50] lagweezle: lukeis: Just checked our code to make certain it is driver.quit() rather than driver.close(). driver.quit() is called in a finally block, so the places the code can die w/o calling driver.quit() is pretty small.
[2014-04-17 10:05:20] lagweezle: I'm not entirely certain we always call driver.quit(), but it is unlikely it isn't being called.
[2014-04-17 10:05:29] lukeis: well, even if there's one place, over time that will creep up because it will leave the temp profile

[2014-04-17 13:22:24] sircapsalot: AutomatedTester excellent.. there are a crap ton of .iml's.. i'm just curious how you set yours up to build correct? do you use the base selenium.iml file?
[2014-04-17 13:22:46] AutomatedTester: I dont build in intellij
[2014-04-17 13:22:51] AutomatedTester: I use the commandline
[2014-04-17 13:23:15] sircapsalot: gotcha, so you ignore all the errors that intellij spits out?
[2014-04-17 13:23:55] AutomatedTester: yea but I am not the best person to ask
[2014-04-17 13:24:00] sircapsalot: sorry, i used the word "build"  I just meant to manage*

[2014-04-17 13:26:13] AutomatedTester: and only load it up to touch java which is very rare
[2014-04-17 13:26:37] sircapsalot: luckily, IntelliJ is nice with customization. i just disabled all inspections
[2014-04-17 13:27:06] AutomatedTester: I like intellij for quickly navigating the Java code
[2014-04-17 13:27:26] lukeis: yeah, to echo david… use IntelliJ to edit things, even run some of the tests, but not to build nor to run the whole test suite. Use ./go commands for that
[2014-04-17 13:28:16] sircapsalot: cool cool.  as i stated earlier, i'll be doing as much as i can get to the issue count down and put out enhancements.. time permitting
