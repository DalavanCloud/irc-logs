[2014-04-04 09:25:18] jimevans: the implementations can't conform to the spec until the spec is complete, but the spec as written currently doesn't conform to current implementations, but the implementations can't conform to the spec until the spec is complete, but...
[2014-04-04 09:25:29] lukeis: ;)
[2014-04-04 09:26:29] dogarrhea: sounds like some analyst i knew... "we can't get the requirements set without data.  We can't get data without the user using the product"
[2014-04-04 09:26:41] dogarrhea: it didn't really turn out that great for this person.

[2014-04-04 09:27:39] jimevans: part of the problem with visibility is that it *seems* so gosh-darned *easy* to determine. "look, i can see the damned thing, right there, on the page, with my own two eyes!" that's great, and all, good for you. now quantify that as something that can be determined using properties, attributes, and functions provided by the dom.

[2014-04-04 09:28:18] lukeis: dogarrhea: that's what prototypes and beta users are for :)
[2014-04-04 09:28:52] jimevans: dogarrhea: i'm not saying the spec process is perfect, but there is a cause-and-effect challenge at work. trying to argue otherwise is being disingenuous at best
[2014-04-04 09:28:56] dogarrhea: i'm definitely  one of those beta users
[2014-04-04 09:30:22] *lukeis thinks about detecting webdriver running and injecting a div that's transparent, fills the whole screen and has a massively high z-index. (now to just hack a bunch of sites to put that in)'
[2014-04-04 09:30:55] dogarrhea: jimevans. that's fine, but at least make it clear it's not working in the spec
[2014-04-04 09:31:08] dogarrhea: errata is useful :)

[2014-04-04 09:33:36] jimevans: i'm not sure how it's the job of the spec body (the w3c) to track all of the deviations from the (as yet unfinished!) spec in every implementation (one from google, one [largely unmaintained now] from opera software, one in development from mozilla, one in development from microsoft, at least three from the open-source project, and there may be others), but whatever.
[2014-04-04 09:34:00] jimevans: and yeah, that's what conformance tests are for.
[2014-04-04 09:34:08] jimevans: and i'll cop to being part of the problem there.

[2014-04-04 09:36:42] jleyba: This is an executeScript command.  Does this just mean we're at the mercy of IE's JS engine?

[2014-04-04 09:56:23] jimevans: my point is i'm tired of the not-so-veiled accusations from some quarters that the IE driver is shit, without people having any idea of the magnitude of the challenge of getting anything working, let alone something that doesn't choke on every little corner case that may be out there because some stupid js framework decides to do something "clever"
[2014-04-04 09:57:21] lukeis: some day… in 10+ years IE11 will be the lowest supported browser… and then jimevans, then, you can rest ;)
[2014-04-04 09:57:22] jimevans: oh, and doing so simply because one decides to do it, not because one gets compensation for it (regardless of what mistaken ideas some of those self-same accusers have)

[2014-04-04 10:28:45] detronizator: lukeis: I'm sure it is
[2014-04-04 10:28:45] lukeis: it's not though
[2014-04-04 10:28:51] lukeis: nope ;)
[2014-04-04 10:29:18] detronizator: Let me look at the unmarshalling code in RemoteWebDriver
[2014-04-04 10:29:20] lukeis: i use RemoteWebDriver in my test code
[2014-04-04 10:29:35] lukeis: which is "working"
[2014-04-04 10:29:56] lukeis: SelendroidDriver does not override RWD's logging api mechanism
[2014-04-04 10:30:12] lukeis: (if you're talking client side)
[2014-04-04 10:31:00] lukeis: if it wasn't "working" I would have no issue changing it
[2014-04-04 10:36:44] bbark123: Does anyone happen to know a workaround to execute a JavascriptExecutor to trigger the css :hover in IE8?
[2014-04-04 10:37:28] jimevans: bbark123: you don't.
[2014-04-04 10:37:41] jimevans: or rather, you use native events to do it.
[2014-04-04 10:37:59] andreBeginner, quitting. (Quit: Quitte)
[2014-04-04 10:38:04] jimevans: it's a limitation of pure javascript implementations that they can't trigger a css :hover.
[2014-04-04 10:38:55] bbark123: ah, ok that is why i'm running into a brick wall. I'll try playing around with native events. I found http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver which seemd to be a great doc on IE so hopefully I can find something that'll work
[2014-04-04 10:38:58] jimevans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhAB-yxW_60
[2014-04-04 10:39:42] bbark123: nice! I'll have to watch that

[2014-04-04 10:40:01] detronizator: this should be the code that takes a remote log
[2014-04-04 10:40:08] detronizator: and converts it to LogEntry
[2014-04-04 10:40:11] bbark123: Thanks for your help jimevans
[2014-04-04 10:40:16] jimevans: bbark123: also, http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html and http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/01/revisiting-native-events-in-ie-driver.html
[2014-04-04 10:40:33] detronizator: now, the loop does the conversion into LogEntry
[2014-04-04 10:40:53] detronizator: and assumes that the raw object can be mappet to List<Map<String, Object>>
[2014-04-04 10:40:55] lukeis: detronizator: can you link what you're changing?
[2014-04-04 10:41:06] detronizator: changing?
[2014-04-04 10:41:12] lukeis: or what this is?

[2014-04-04 10:41:41] detronizator: from Selenium
[2014-04-04 10:41:42] lukeis: ah yeah
[2014-04-04 10:42:02] lukeis: so, that's why it works, since the level and timestamp are just Null in selendroid's case

[2014-04-04 10:44:43] *lukeis has been looking through it for a long time...'
[2014-04-04 10:44:43] detronizator: if you want to parse it out
[2014-04-04 10:45:06] lukeis: i don't know why one would programmatically do that other than to pump the log to a file to review later
[2014-04-04 10:45:24] detronizator: you never know what crazy shit people decide to do
[2014-04-04 10:45:26] lukeis: unless they want to add some very special intelligence to figure out errors
[2014-04-04 10:45:39] lukeis: they would have a lot of extra time on their hands :)
[2014-04-04 10:45:58] lukeis: there's much bigger fish to fry! ;)
[2014-04-04 10:46:01] detronizator: lukeis: I think it's a bit judgemental trying to define how people use their time

[2014-04-04 13:21:17] jimevans: kingkaeru: what language are you using?
[2014-04-04 13:21:43] kingkaeru: i have no preference right now.
[2014-04-04 13:21:48] kingkaeru: at least on the automated test side

[2014-04-04 13:21:59] lukeis1, changing nick to lukeis.
[2014-04-04 13:22:09] kingkaeru: .net mvc mainly
[2014-04-04 13:22:24] jmasseo: is there a replacement for selenium IDE?
[2014-04-04 13:22:33] lukeis: then you should choose C# .NET bindings
[2014-04-04 13:22:43] kingkaeru: we already do unit testing but i'm looking to automate our end to end testing in different browsers
[2014-04-04 13:22:51] lukeis: jmasseo: not really… there's something called "selenium builder"
[2014-04-04 13:22:53] jimevans: jmasseo: there is, but it's not very far along yet.
[2014-04-04 13:23:09] kingkaeru: lukeis: half the app is classic asp
[2014-04-04 13:23:17] jmasseo: it's working fine for my needs, which is exporting python test cases to be modified for my framework
[2014-04-04 13:23:49] lukeis: kingkaeru: ok, then you should pick a language that most of the developers already know
[2014-04-04 13:23:52] *jimevans hates test recorders with the passion of a thousand suns'

[2014-04-04 13:25:27] jmasseo: jimevans1: do you find people produce non-working tests?
[2014-04-04 13:25:33] lukeis: jmasseo: we typically don't say there's no use for IDE, as much as we despise it, but typically users are trying to automate test cases and the IDE just doesn't scale and provide maintainability :)

[2014-04-04 13:25:46] lukeis: i don't know… so… so much ;)
[2014-04-04 13:25:56] jmasseo: lukeis: oh yeah.  it's kind of awful.  i just like being able to dump out the login and logout sequences for the website.
[2014-04-04 13:26:08] jimevans1: jmasseo: i've found that it doesn't save me time in the long run, but that's just my experience. i find that they produce non-maintainable code
[2014-04-04 13:26:16] jmasseo: jimevans1: i'm inclined to agree.
[2014-04-04 13:27:04] jimevans1: jmasseo: and people (read: management) tend to get seduced by "ZOMG! IT'S SO EASY!!" when in reality automated testing is anything but.
[2014-04-04 13:27:17] jmasseo: right
[2014-04-04 13:27:28] jmasseo: i tried to walk our ops guys through using this crap to build a new job and it whizzed right over their head.
[2014-04-04 13:27:35] kingkaeru: what pattern do you guys use for your tests in webdriver? AAA?  also, any guidance/links to what types of browser automated tests you have found useful?
[2014-04-04 13:27:35] jmasseo: not the clicky part but the having to modify the source file afterwards.
[2014-04-04 13:28:01] jimevans1: so people start down a road that's unsustainable, and doesn't scale, and then get frustrated when it takes longer than it did at first, and then the tool gets blamed.
[2014-04-04 13:28:11] jmasseo: also every single system is different and WRONG in it's own magical way, so there was a lot less code reuse than I had hoped initially. :/

[2014-04-04 13:30:40] jmasseo: i'm not using selenium for testing.
[2014-04-04 13:30:47] jimevans: automated software testing is software development. i've been convinced of this in my experience in the industry. i've yet to see any situation that convinces me otherwise.
[2014-04-04 13:31:13] jmasseo: I'm doing file transfer automation from health care EFT's.

[2014-04-04 13:31:34] kingkaeru: interesting...so you're using selenium as a service?
[2014-04-04 13:31:35] jmasseo: because it's sane to pay a guy to full time download files from the web in the 21st century.
[2014-04-04 13:31:49] rorycb: jimevans, I fully agree with that.

[2014-04-04 13:32:07] kingkaeru: wget not good enough?

[2014-04-04 13:32:22] jmasseo: this is all 'enterprise' software.
[2014-04-04 13:32:31] jmasseo: which means it's full of shit that makes it absolutely impossible to use a sane scripting approach
[2014-04-04 13:32:38] jmasseo: one of them had url's that were random.
[2014-04-04 13:32:52] jmasseo: tons of javascript

[2014-04-04 13:33:50] jmasseo: heh
[2014-04-04 13:34:01] jmasseo: our ops guys have been here a long time
[2014-04-04 13:34:06] jmasseo: they used to load these same files off of 9 track tapes.
[2014-04-04 13:35:04] jmasseo: manual labor is the nemesis of a true systems administrator.
[2014-04-04 13:35:11] jmasseo: Thou shalt script it.
[2014-04-04 13:35:33] kingkaeru: yes!
[2014-04-04 13:35:51] jmasseo: so it causes me pain to see someone have to sit and click things for hours on end.
[2014-04-04 13:36:15] jmasseo: now that i've got the swing of selenium, i can turn these jobs out pretty quickly.
[2014-04-04 13:36:20] jmasseo: definately improved my HTML fu.
[2014-04-04 13:36:26] kingkaeru: what about using a browser mod?
[2014-04-04 13:36:32] jmasseo: greasemonkey?
[2014-04-04 13:36:36] kingkaeru: yeah
[2014-04-04 13:36:42] jmasseo: this lets me completely remove their interaction from the process
[2014-04-04 13:36:43] kingkaeru: or something even more purposebuilt
[2014-04-04 13:36:56] jmasseo: the EFT system runs my python webdriver job, and then moves the files to the aix box
[2014-04-04 13:36:58] kingkaeru: there are extensions taht let you download links on a page
[2014-04-04 13:37:17] jmasseo: right
[2014-04-04 13:37:19] kingkaeru: then you can have some sort of script to post process the saved files and filter out what you want
[2014-04-04 13:37:30] jmasseo: oh yeah, this also lets me compensate for other vendor idiocy
[2014-04-04 13:37:36] jmasseo: like an EFT system that gives you each file as 'download.do'
[2014-04-04 13:37:50] kingkaeru: do.do?
[2014-04-04 13:37:53] jmasseo: so i scrape the span tag and use it for the filename.
[2014-04-04 13:37:58] jmasseo: and now i've got sane filenames
[2014-04-04 13:38:04] jmasseo: and a local database so i don't redownload files.
[2014-04-04 13:38:11] jmasseo: each job is custom.

[2014-04-04 13:39:54] jmasseo: webdriver is definately a step up
[2014-04-04 13:40:01] brma: If there isn't a security issue, have you considered mechanical turk to get it done cheaply?
[2014-04-04 13:40:04] acidpeak: Hey all
[2014-04-04 13:40:09] jmasseo: definately a security issue there.

[2014-04-04 14:09:02] modeck: question on selendroid
[2014-04-04 14:09:17] modeck: anyone?
[2014-04-04 14:10:09] smccarthy: modeck: ask away
[2014-04-04 14:10:30] modeck: OK thanks
[2014-04-04 14:11:09] modeck: http://selendroid.io/scale.html
[2014-04-04 14:11:23] modeck: my question relates to this, essentially
[2014-04-04 14:11:54] modeck: i can get selendroid working from my mac on some devices on a "one-to-one" basis
[2014-04-04 14:12:32] modeck: ideally, i want to get a selenium script executed on my mac
[2014-04-04 14:12:52] modeck: working on a number of android devices (say even 2-4)
[2014-04-04 14:13:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 797
[2014-04-04 14:13:32] modeck: i'm working with PY
[2014-04-04 14:13:35] modeck: and PY only
[2014-04-04 14:13:39] smccarthy: modeck: sorry, I don't know. So far I have only done 1 emulator at a time. There is also #selendroid . They probably know more

[2014-04-04 14:14:25] lukeis: selendroid standalone can handle multiple devices at once
[2014-04-04 14:14:31] modeck: i can get selenium grid executing against 3-4 desktops simultaneously

[2014-04-04 14:15:07] lukeis: yes, modeck, it basically works the exact same way :)

[2014-04-04 14:16:27] modeck: @lukeis but what happened was, that instead of executing across both devices at the same time
[2014-04-04 14:16:49] modeck: @lukeis ...it executed once on the 'first' device, then a second time
[2014-04-04 14:16:53] modeck: make sense?
[2014-04-04 14:17:04] modeck: second time on same device
[2014-04-04 14:17:11] modeck: not the 'second' device
[2014-04-04 14:17:15] modeck: ya know?
[2014-04-04 14:17:20] lukeis: are you using grid?
[2014-04-04 14:17:32] lukeis: or just the standalone server?
[2014-04-04 14:17:43] modeck: yeh, or a variation of it
[2014-04-04 14:17:45] modeck: http://selendroid.io/scale.html
[2014-04-04 14:17:52] modeck: i'm following the instrux here
[2014-04-04 14:17:58] lukeis: so, grid
[2014-04-04 14:18:25] modeck: @lukeis i should point out the following
[2014-04-04 14:18:32] lukeis: are you following it exactly and specifying max instances as 1 still? :)
[2014-04-04 14:18:38] modeck: i am STRICTLY mobile web testing

[2014-04-04 14:18:58] lukeis: yep, gotcha

[2014-04-04 14:21:12] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-04 14:21:17] modeck: the JSON registered both
[2014-04-04 14:21:46] modeck: and when i went to grid/console, both were there
[2014-04-04 14:21:50] lukeis: ok, so what makes you think you can have more than one Selendroid instance running? :)
[2014-04-04 14:21:59] modeck: why not?
[2014-04-04 14:22:11] lukeis: because you just said run 1 Android.   1
[2014-04-04 14:22:16] lukeis: as in, one ;)

[2014-04-04 14:23:01] modeck: i don't have the file with me here at home
[2014-04-04 14:23:23] lukeis: the grid console will show up multiple 'android' (broken?) icons if it has 2
[2014-04-04 14:23:48] modeck: initially, i ran both instances as android
