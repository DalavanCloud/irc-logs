[2014-04-02 08:54:53] polyvisual: and got a workaround other than barancev in comment 4?
[2014-04-02 08:55:29] polyvisual: i can provide a test case if it'll help

[2014-04-02 09:04:43] polyvisual: ah
[2014-04-02 09:04:45] polyvisual: :)
[2014-04-02 09:05:28] AutomatedTester: hopefully before Se3 once the Se3 stuff has been landed and released under Se2
[2014-04-02 09:06:01] AutomatedTester: it was going to be in Firefox 31 but time is against me and all the people who could work on it have been put on a fire drill
[2014-04-02 09:06:08] lukeis: it should be Se2 compatible, it will certainly be Se3 compatible :)

[2014-04-02 12:40:47] EthanHunt: Does anyone know why Firefox does this - https://www.dropbox.com/s/s5weqf1gb7ipax1/FirefoxWebDriver.gif
[2014-04-02 12:40:52] EthanHunt: but Chrome does not
[2014-04-02 12:41:42] jimevans: yes. firefox is launched silently to clean, validate, and fixup the anonymous profile used by webdriver.
[2014-04-02 12:42:33] jimevans: that profile is written on-the-fly by the driver, and may be copied from an existing profile. as such, it may require cleanup to be a valid profile.
[2014-04-02 12:42:33] EthanHunt: jimevans: Thanks Jim, is there a way to stp that from happening via script?
[2014-04-02 12:42:41] jimevans: nope. it's baked in.

[2014-04-02 12:43:51] EthanHunt: @jim
[2014-04-02 12:44:20] EthanHunt: jimevans: I have a script that runs tests against more than 2000 user agents
[2014-04-02 12:44:49] EthanHunt: jimevans: And this verification of profile slows it down. I am not sure why this does not affect Chrome
[2014-04-02 12:45:05] jimevans: because chrome doesn't require such verification.
[2014-04-02 12:45:54] gagangowda10, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-02 12:45:55] jimevans: the chrome driver doesn't let you potentially screw up the chrome user profile in such a way as to make the browser unusable as the firefox driver does
[2014-04-02 12:46:18] EthanHunt: jimevans: Aha. That makes sense. One more - what kind of rendering engine is used by HTMLUnit driver? Is it possible to see it's user agent?
[2014-04-02 12:47:02] jimevans: HtmlUnit doesn't use a rendering engine. at best, it's a "fake" rendering engine written in java by the author of htmlunit.
[2014-04-02 12:47:20] EthanHunt: jimevans: Cool, thanks. And it's user agent?
[2014-04-02 12:47:51] jimevans: that's one reason i recommend phantomjs over htmlunit if you're absolutely dead-set on headless testing (even with the dubious benefit i believe it to be)
[2014-04-02 12:47:55] jimevans: no diea.
[2014-04-02 12:47:58] jimevans: idea even
[2014-04-02 12:48:08] jimevans: you'll need to investigate on your own.

[2014-04-02 13:43:42] LocusAsaf: Is there a way to search for an element whose value attribute is a non-empty string?
[2014-04-02 13:44:26] LocusAsaf: something like...find_element_by_css('#myid [value="*"]')
[2014-04-02 13:44:51] LocusAsaf: or more accurately, if I'm talking RE, find_element_by_css('#myid [value="+"]')
[2014-04-02 13:44:57] LocusAsaf: ?
[2014-04-02 13:45:38] jimevans: well, given that css selectors don't support regular expressions, i'm going to guess that won't work.
[2014-04-02 13:45:43] jimevans: you might be able to do it with xpath
[2014-04-02 13:47:24] LocusAsaf: :(
[2014-04-02 13:47:39] LocusAsaf: well it doesn't have to be a RE
[2014-04-02 13:47:49] LocusAsaf: just wondering if theres some way of doing that

[2014-04-02 13:49:02] jimevans: note that won't work on IE8 and below.

[2014-04-02 13:50:43] LocusAsaf: how come jim?
[2014-04-02 13:51:06] jimevans: because it's a css3 selector. IE8 and below doesn't support css3

[2014-04-02 13:51:48] sircapsalot: according to those charts, yep.
[2014-04-02 13:51:57] LocusAsaf: w00p okay thanks guys
[2014-04-02 13:52:18] LocusAsaf: sircaps why do you need the ':"
[2014-04-02 13:52:30] sircapsalot: it indicates a pseudo-selector
[2014-04-02 13:52:56] LocusAsaf: okay lemme give it a shot
[2014-04-02 13:53:00] sircapsalot: should learn more about them.  they increase specificity
[2014-04-02 13:53:20] LocusAsaf: definitely useful for what I'm trying to solve

[2014-04-02 14:34:43] LocusAsaf: theres no way to select css based on text in elements right?
[2014-04-02 14:34:53] jimevans: nope
[2014-04-02 14:35:31] jimevans: the :contains pseudoselector isn't really a selector supported by the w3c css standards.
[2014-04-02 14:36:47] LocusAsaf: so it's bad to use contains?
[2014-04-02 14:37:20] jimevans: the theory being that css is *only* supposed to apply to style, not content.
[2014-04-02 14:37:50] LocusAsaf: does webdriver have a nice way of nice supported way locating text values?
[2014-04-02 14:37:58] jimevans: xpath
[2014-04-02 14:38:25] jimevans: it's one of the few use cases for it that aren't meetable by css selectors or another strategy.
[2014-04-02 14:38:47] LocusAsaf: why do people not like using xpath searches?
[2014-04-02 14:39:23] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-02 14:39:27] jimevans: because they can be difficult to read to the uninitiated, and they can be very, very slow compared to css selectors and other strategies, particularly in older versions of IE.
[2014-04-02 14:39:38] jimevans: (though there's conflicting data on that point)
[2014-04-02 14:42:00] LocusAsaf: okay
[2014-04-02 14:42:28] LocusAsaf: if you're really set on finding text inside of an element its the only universal supported way
[2014-04-02 14:42:56] LocusAsaf: contains will work on modern browsers I'm guessing but is contentious, is that the gist of it?
[2014-04-02 14:43:25] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 787
[2014-04-02 14:44:13] jimevans: no, :contains won't work anywhere.
[2014-04-02 14:44:23] jimevans: (unless you're using the sizzle library)
[2014-04-02 14:44:30] jimevans: sorry.
[2014-04-02 14:44:34] jimevans: let me be more precise
[2014-04-02 14:44:51] jimevans: :contains won't work on any browser that strictly adheres to the w3c css standards.
[2014-04-02 14:45:13] jimevans: it certainly won't work on any version of IE
