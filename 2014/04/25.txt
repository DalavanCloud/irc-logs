[2014-04-25 12:43:22] MattAtL: Hi, I've a question about Chrome driver and tables...
[2014-04-25 12:43:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 798
[2014-04-25 12:43:56] MattAtL: I'm using phpunit and am getting the text of a table
[2014-04-25 12:44:14] MattAtL: ie. $this->getElementByTagName("table")->text();
[2014-04-25 12:45:21] MattAtL: though I think phpunit is irrelevant
[2014-04-25 12:45:21] MattAtL: In Chrome, it returns the text content as it's marked up: <thead> content, then <tfoot>, then <tbody>
[2014-04-25 12:45:21] MattAtL: In Firefox and IE, I get it as it's rendered, so <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>
[2014-04-25 12:45:28] MattAtL: which means my tests fail on Chrome.
[2014-04-25 12:46:16] MattAtL: I'm not sure what the correct behaviour should be, but inconsistent behaviour feels like a bug
[2014-04-25 12:46:41] AutomatedTester: MattAtL: its returning the element tags
[2014-04-25 12:46:51] AutomatedTester: or the text from the element tags in a weird order
[2014-04-25 12:46:54] MattAtL: Was wondering if anyone's come across this before?  Googling and searching the forum haven't found anything
[2014-04-25 12:47:03] MattAtL: Sorry, no, not the tags, just the text content
[2014-04-25 12:47:15] AutomatedTester: that is bizarre
[2014-04-25 12:47:23] MattAtL: But Chrome returns them in a different order to the others
[2014-04-25 12:47:32] AutomatedTester: well... Chrome is the new IE...
[2014-04-25 12:47:53] MattAtL: In a way both are correct.  The <tfoot> should come before the <tbody> in the html
[2014-04-25 12:48:01] MattAtL: But obviously browsers mostly render them at the bottom
[2014-04-25 12:48:27] MattAtL: So Chrome is returning it in the order that the html is laid out; Firefox/IE in the order they are rendered
[2014-04-25 12:48:47] AutomatedTester: render tree should be consistent
[2014-04-25 12:49:24] MattAtL: Do you mean they should all look the same in different browsers? Because they do.

[2014-04-25 12:50:42] AutomatedTester: its JS
[2014-04-25 12:50:53] MattAtL: yup, just firing them all up...
[2014-04-25 12:50:57] AutomatedTester: <3
[2014-04-25 12:55:08] MattAtL: Yup, you're right, Chrome gives the textContent with the <tfoot> content between head and body; Firefox puts it at the bottom.
[2014-04-25 12:55:23] MattAtL: Does that mean it's not even a Selenium bug?
[2014-04-25 12:55:35] AutomatedTester: yup

[2014-04-25 12:57:28] nirvdrum: Yet. At this point it's pretty safe to say it's not going to get fixed.
[2014-04-25 12:57:41] nirvdrum: Given I had a chromium PM  tell me it would be fixed in a meeting.
[2014-04-25 12:58:26] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you need to tell them they are breaking spec and they move quickly
[2014-04-25 12:58:29] MattAtL: I'm fairly new to Selenium stuff: do you think it's worth putting on the google groups forum too just for the record?

[2014-04-25 13:07:51] dude-x: i guess Select is fine as it is;
[2014-04-25 13:07:56] lukeis: (you know most of Selenium works due to "javascript magic") :)
[2014-04-25 13:08:08] dude-x: i was just worried about a case when people do execute_script('thing = value')
[2014-04-25 13:09:23] dude-x: then it forces the value to always be that value and tests pass when the actual state is corrupt
[2014-04-25 13:09:23] dude-x: or tests fail because the value is forced
[2014-04-25 13:09:23] dude-x: realized
[2014-04-25 13:09:23] HeavyD, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-25 13:09:23] dude-x: it probably does a find element and then set the option

[2014-04-25 13:09:55] lukeis: the atoms have code that knows that the option is a special case and does the javascript magic to set it
