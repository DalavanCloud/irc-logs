[2014-04-14 10:16:54] jimevans: dogarrhea_: which version of firefox?
[2014-04-14 10:16:55] dogarrhea_: we've been using since before I arrived.  Is it time to disrupt and make things work
[2014-04-14 10:16:59] dogarrhea_: 23
[2014-04-14 10:17:12] dogarrhea_: we keep getting these firefox binary can't connect on port blah blah blah etc
[2014-04-14 10:17:37] Archdude_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-14 10:18:29] jimevans: 2.34 supports native events (the default for windows) for firefox 10, 17, 21, and 22.
[2014-04-14 10:18:49] jimevans: so there might be a mismatch there.
[2014-04-14 10:18:51] dogarrhea_: keke. we are also running this on linux

[2014-04-14 10:19:05] dogarrhea_: because thoughtworks doesn't see the need to run firefox on windows for some reason
[2014-04-14 10:19:19] jimevans: why firefox 23, though?
[2014-04-14 10:19:28] dogarrhea_: business decision really.
[2014-04-14 10:19:47] dogarrhea_: maybe it had something to do with the cross domain cookie change in 23
[2014-04-14 10:20:03] dogarrhea_: sharing cookies across iframes no longer works
[2014-04-14 10:20:04] jimevans: seems an odd version. if it were up to me, i'd expect to run against firefox 24, if only because it's an ESR.
[2014-04-14 10:20:15] Dave_B_: I think 2.35 was the first driver to support ff23
[2014-04-14 10:20:43] dogarrhea_: either way, 23 was what they chose based on functionality changes.
[2014-04-14 10:20:53] Dave_B_: aha
[2014-04-14 10:20:57] Dave_B_: 2.37 for you
[2014-04-14 10:21:09] Dave_B_: v2.37.0
[2014-04-14 10:21:09] Dave_B_: =======
[2014-04-14 10:21:09] Dave_B_:   * Fix Firefox native event support on Linux for 23 & 24.
[2014-04-14 10:21:49] Dave_B_: unless you're not using native events in which case maybe you'd be ok with 2.35
[2014-04-14 10:22:31] dogarrhea_: ok. i'll upgrade and see.
[2014-04-14 10:22:43] dogarrhea_: i'll see if the developer cry foul or our tests start breaknig
[2014-04-14 10:25:18] dogarrhea_: yea. it was picked due to cross domain cookie change in this version of firefox
[2014-04-14 10:25:33] dogarrhea_: and a fundamental rewrite of cross domain cookie functionality

[2014-04-14 12:41:58] anndruu12: Hi. I am using selenium for smoke testing. Due to the skill level of the testers, I have to use the IDE. I am recording with firefox, and playing the tests in IE using the webdriver option in the IDE. Is there a way for the playback to happen in the background so they can do other things while the tests run?
[2014-04-14 12:42:41] phasze: anndruu12: not if you're using the IDE to run them as well.

[2014-04-14 16:25:23] dogarrhea_: for example,  we wait for an element to become stale.  By the time the hub/sauceconnect component sends this over the internet to the browser, the element is no longer able to be stale again because the javascript that makes it stale (animate) has completed before the selenium command does anything
[2014-04-14 16:25:54] dogarrhea_: it's basically that selenium doesn't actually handle the internet well.
[2014-04-14 16:26:27] dogarrhea_: latency and meters per second and all that jazz and sliding window protocol and tcp/ip and what not. it's as if it was never a consideration.

[2014-04-14 16:53:42] dogarrhea_: using xpath?
[2014-04-14 16:54:19] Dad: But the problem is that the page generates a big table.  But that big table does not seem to exist in the output.   (And yes, the selenium ide that creates tests - I am just using that so I can generate the perl code for myself conveniently).
[2014-04-14 16:54:50] dogarrhea_: that approach is highly deprecated

[2014-04-14 17:05:47] Dad: thank you AuthomatedTester!   Okay, so I should not use (in my perl script)  use Test::WWW::Selenium   and instead use
[2014-04-14 17:06:22] Dad: "use Selenium::Remote::Driver"...

[2014-04-14 17:14:41] edoceo: How does the Selenium Server thing know what browsers it can run, just through -Dwebdriver.$something.driver entries?

[2014-04-14 19:55:54] dude-x: but the other languages have page_source command
[2014-04-14 19:56:11] dude-x: you can grab the DOM source and do stuff with the text

[2014-04-14 20:04:26] Dad: dude-x, thank you!!!   That is exactly what I needed.  The page_source method gives the whole page output.  Then, there are perl extensions I found tonite, like HTML::TableExtract which make parsing a table a breeze.   Thanks again!
[2014-04-14 20:05:10] dude-x: no problem. :)
