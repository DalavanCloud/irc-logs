[2014-04-03 07:14:27] jimevans: also, if you're that enamored of string-only locator types, it's cake to write your own parsing module.
[2014-04-03 07:14:44] Tarun: using string format it easy to make changes to locator without changing the code
[2014-04-03 07:14:56] Tarun: that what i do as of now
[2014-04-03 07:16:29] jimevans: i really don't see the benefit, to be honest. if you're thinking your element locators as something other than "code", You're Doing It Wrong™ even if you keep the locators in "separate text files".
[2014-04-03 07:16:41] jimevans: then they're just code kept in a different location.
[2014-04-03 07:17:28] *jimevans is feeling argumentative today. Cross him at your peril.'
[2014-04-03 07:18:09] Tarun: okie
[2014-04-03 07:20:18] Tarun: one more thing I have been experimenting with is IEDriverServer to connect to an IE instance using desiredcapabilities
[2014-04-03 07:20:46] Tarun: this allows capability to test browser inside a custom .NET application
[2014-04-03 07:20:51] Tarun: also
[2014-04-03 07:21:08] jimevans: you'd need to add support to IEDriverServer to allow that.
[2014-04-03 07:21:27] Tarun: yes, i have already got some part of it working
[2014-04-03 07:21:28] jimevans: in other words, you'd need an HTTP end point for the wire protocol
[2014-04-03 07:21:55] Tarun: you think that would be received well to be updated in IEDriverServer?
[2014-04-03 07:22:30] jimevans: maybe. i wouldn't do it as part of capabilities though.
[2014-04-03 07:22:48] jimevans: i'd create a new http end point and custom command.
[2014-04-03 07:22:49] TuesdayCore, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-04-03 07:23:12] Tarun: if do it as part of desired capabilities them every language will be able to connect without any code changes
[2014-04-03 07:23:39] Tarun: else everyone will have to adapt to the change
[2014-04-03 07:24:06] jimevans: otherwise you're likely to get conflicts between what capabilities you pass and what is actually supported.
[2014-04-03 07:24:09] Tarun: and when we request a browser using DC, we should be fine specifying its window name or title also
[2014-04-03 07:24:13] jimevans: yes, that's correct

[2014-04-03 07:24:33] jimevans: for something like this, you absolutely *want* to force language binding changes.
[2014-04-03 07:25:14] jimevans: future versions of the language bindings are going to move away from random key-value pairs of capabilities that are easily manipulable by language bindings.
[2014-04-03 07:25:27] jimevans: moving to type-safe options classes.

[2014-04-03 10:30:35] Teorias: other for intellij

[2014-04-03 10:31:34] Teorias: ok
[2014-04-03 10:31:34] lukeis: yeah
[2014-04-03 10:31:44] Teorias: so, i just did go -T
[2014-04-03 10:31:47] lukeis: just tell intellij to open an existing project
[2014-04-03 10:31:53] lukeis: for what?
[2014-04-03 10:32:03] Teorias: and go Selenium-server-standalone
[2014-04-03 10:32:10] lukeis: you'll want to look at the Rakefile
[2014-04-03 10:32:13] lukeis: oh
[2014-04-03 10:32:14] Teorias: and everything goes right ;)
[2014-04-03 10:32:16] lukeis: ./go release
[2014-04-03 10:32:32] lukeis: that's the easiest target to build the standalone server
[2014-04-03 10:32:58] Teorias: yes
[2014-04-03 10:33:02] lukeis: (does a few extra things, but the bulk of the work goes to that)
[2014-04-03 10:33:06] Teorias: but I would like to instead of just compile
[2014-04-03 10:33:07] Teorias: it
[2014-04-03 10:33:14] Teorias: there is any way to debug the stuff?
[2014-04-03 10:33:30] lukeis: run some of the tests in debug mode :)
[2014-04-03 10:33:36] lukeis: (from intellij)
[2014-04-03 10:34:23] Teorias: ok, I will try to deep a little more, and get more specific questions :)
[2014-04-03 10:34:31] Teorias: thanks for the help lukeis
[2014-04-03 10:35:37] lukeis: the selenium project is really setup to be TDD… write your test for your expected behavior and run it till you can make it pass ;)

[2014-04-03 11:11:31] Rion421: @ato I notice that you guys have a chatbot that you can give commands to. Would it make sense to add the ability for the chatbot to check if someone has or has not signed the CLA?
[2014-04-03 11:11:48] Rion421: Not sure if that's possible, but it would seem to reduce the time it takes to get an answer. :)
[2014-04-03 11:12:04] ato: Rion421: IMO yes, but it's currently only accessible to one person.
[2014-04-03 11:12:18] Rion421: gotcha
[2014-04-03 11:12:19] ato: Hence all the questions around CLA's.
[2014-04-03 11:12:54] ato: So what we'd need is a way to anonymously probe the CLA list with an email and get back a boolean describing whether that person is on the list.
[2014-04-03 11:12:57] lukeis: i have to write something for auto reading a google spreadsheet and then hand it over to simon and then i'll have selbot2 poll it for us :)
[2014-04-03 11:13:16] sircapsalot: chatbox .. pssh.. who care about automation when you can do everything manual
[2014-04-03 11:13:18] ato: That'd be smashing
[2014-04-03 11:13:22] sircapsalot: oh sorry, wrong chat room? ;)

[2014-04-03 11:35:30] ato: LocusAsaf: Is there a delay in opening the dialogue that causes WebDriver not to find the button?
[2014-04-03 11:36:01] LocusAsaf: it finds the button
[2014-04-03 11:36:22] LocusAsaf: and I execute .click() but it fails to click or something
[2014-04-03 11:36:32] ato: Are you getting an error for the click()?
[2014-04-03 11:36:51] LocusAsaf: nope

[2014-04-03 11:37:15] ato: Can you provide the HTML/CSS/JS/test code so we can reproduce it?
[2014-04-03 11:38:27] LocusAsaf: unfortunately I can't
[2014-04-03 11:38:44] Todd: I just hit this bug trying to run against sauce... https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=7131
[2014-04-03 11:39:03] LocusAsaf: and it doesn't seem simple enough to reproduce in a simple example
[2014-04-03 11:39:36] LocusAsaf: but from your perspective there shouldn't be any reason why it should fail right?
[2014-04-03 11:39:37] jimevans: LocusAsaf: you'll have difficulty getting anyone to help you, if you can't provide a sample.
[2014-04-03 11:39:40] ato: LocusAsaf: With all due respect, I think you're wrong.
[2014-04-03 11:39:48] ato: Think of the :kittens.
[2014-04-03 11:39:48] selbot2: Before you say you cannot provide html, think of the kittens! http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html

[2014-04-03 11:40:16] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-04-03 11:40:16] LocusAsaf: I definitely understand that you guys won't be of much help
[2014-04-03 11:40:37] LocusAsaf: but if there's any common pitfalls you've seen with what I was mentioning please let me know
[2014-04-03 11:40:45] ato: LocusAsaf: But yeah, there's no obvious reason I can think of which would cause that.
[2014-04-03 11:40:51] jimevans: s/won't/can't/
[2014-04-03 11:41:20] ato: LocusAsaf: A good thing to test would be if it happens across all browers?
[2014-04-03 11:41:38] ato: Or, more than one at least.
[2014-04-03 11:41:59] LocusAsaf: will do
[2014-04-03 11:42:13] LocusAsaf: I know that if I add a sufficient sleep it will work more often
[2014-04-03 11:42:22] LocusAsaf: so it does seem like a timing/race condition thing
[2014-04-03 11:42:34] ato: Then it sounds like you might want to introduce an explicit wait condition before calling click on the button.
[2014-04-03 11:43:06] ato: Because of the asyncedness of JS, you need a way to synchronize WD with the state of the document sometimes.

[2014-04-03 11:43:27] LocusAsaf: ato I'm wrapping my find_css call around a webdriver.wait until
[2014-04-03 11:43:28] plightbo_work, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-04-03 11:43:44] ato: Since WebDriver is completely OOP it doesn't know about the state of your document when it calls click.
[2014-04-03 11:44:00] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-03 11:44:02] LocusAsaf: so it does find the find the button before it calls click
[2014-04-03 11:44:16] ato: Right, you said that earlier.
[2014-04-03 11:44:20] LocusAsaf: is there some js condition to check to make sure I can click on the element before I click it aside from seeing the elemnt?
[2014-04-03 11:44:35] ato: Hm. I wonder why an additional sleep would cause it to pass more frequently.
[2014-04-03 11:45:15] LocusAsaf: indeed
[2014-04-03 11:45:18] SamuraiJack__, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2014-04-03 11:45:21] ato: You could use the isEnabled shorthand in WebDriver, I suppose.  But I'm not sure what kind of jQuery button we're dealing with, so I'm not sure if it will help.
[2014-04-03 11:45:44] LocusAsaf: I'll read into that
[2014-04-03 11:45:44] ato: Besides, WD should throw if you try to click a disabled button through the WebElement.click function.
[2014-04-03 11:45:54] LocusAsaf: ah right
[2014-04-03 11:45:57] LocusAsaf: I see what you mean
[2014-04-03 11:46:02] LocusAsaf: enabled attribute right?
[2014-04-03 11:46:05] ato: Or are you using the actions chain to do the click?
[2014-04-03 11:46:32] LocusAsaf: I'm essentially doing driver.find_element_by_css('mycss').click()
[2014-04-03 11:46:40] LocusAsaf: is that what you mean by action chaining?
[2014-04-03 11:46:47] ato: The enabled /property/, yes.
[2014-04-03 11:47:11] LocusAsaf: okay
[2014-04-03 11:47:15] ato: No, sorry.  That call will (should) check if the element is enabled or not first.
[2014-04-03 11:47:28] ato: I was talking about the Actions(driver).move_to_element(el).click().perform() thing.
[2014-04-03 11:47:37] LocusAsaf: gotcha
[2014-04-03 11:48:03] ato: The el.click() is a shorthand which has a slightly different behaviour than the click in the Actions thing I just pasted.
[2014-04-03 11:48:18] plightbo_work, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2014-04-03 11:48:32] LocusAsaf: alright well I appreciate the input
[2014-04-03 11:48:34] ato: (For example it won't do the enabled/disabled check, so I was just curious how you were clicking the element.)
[2014-04-03 11:48:52] LocusAsaf: I'll try and play around with it more and see if I can isolate the issue
[2014-04-03 11:49:06] LocusAsaf: it only happens 1/10 times or so it's a pain to reproduce
[2014-04-03 11:49:06] capri, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-03 11:49:20] ato: My best advice is to reduce complexity and dependencies in your HTML and CSS until the problem becomes 100 % reproducible.
[2014-04-03 11:49:38] LocusAsaf: yeah, also very hard to see the state of the html/js when it fails
[2014-04-03 11:49:50] LocusAsaf: yup, understood
[2014-04-03 11:49:54] ato: Save the document from your browser with all the static files, then start removing stuff until you've got a minimal TC.
[2014-04-03 11:50:16] LocusAsaf: okay
[2014-04-03 11:50:19] ato: Could be that there is some CSS in the document that confuses WD, for example.  Try removing the CSS file.

[2014-04-03 11:52:28] ato: Great!  I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but these things are damn near impossible to figure out by themselves, let alone remotely without code (-:

[2014-04-03 13:56:00] abotalov: it seems to be hard to implement support for modal dialogs at some remote ends (see links in https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24979). What do you think about it?
[2014-04-03 13:57:56] lukeis: modal dialogs are essentially treated like another window handle
[2014-04-03 13:58:23] lukeis: depends on what you mean by modal i suppose :)
[2014-04-03 13:59:04] abotalov: I meanwindow.alert, window.prompt and window.confirm
[2014-04-03 13:59:17] abotalov: What is the "offical" name for those?
[2014-04-03 13:59:31] lukeis: alert, prompt, confirm :)
[2014-04-03 13:59:38] lukeis: cause there's also "window.showModalDialog"
[2014-04-03 13:59:45] lukeis: which is why the confusion

[2014-04-03 14:04:16] abotalov: by linking 1037 I meant in particular this comment - https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/pull/1037#issuecomment-38469234

[2014-04-03 14:07:05] Abhay_: locate = find?
[2014-04-03 14:07:20] jimevans: Abhay_: yeah using findElement (or similar)
[2014-04-03 14:07:29] jimevans: so how do you identify the element within the table?
[2014-04-03 14:07:42] Abhay_: Its a list of devices out which I have to select specific device which I am reading from config file.
[2014-04-03 14:07:59] jimevans: so, you're looking for a specific set of text?
[2014-04-03 14:08:14] Abhay_: Yes
[2014-04-03 14:08:17] Abhay_: Kind of
[2014-04-03 14:08:26] jimevans: or is there some ID or other locator you can use to find the element you need.
[2014-04-03 14:08:29] Abhay_: like /dev/sda or //./PhysicalDrive1
[2014-04-03 14:08:55] Abhay_: I want to select based on the text.

[2014-04-03 14:09:39] jimevans: Abhay_: then use xpath to find the element containing the text (i'm assuming it'll be a <td> element), and find the <input> adjacent to it.
