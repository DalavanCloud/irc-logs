[2014-04-29 11:30:10] joesmith: i'm not sure why it's odd? its a configuration page that has different forms for configuring different things.
[2014-04-29 11:30:49] phasze: but you have multiple forms on the same page and multiple save buttons for each one?
[2014-04-29 11:32:39] joesmith: correct. imagine a web gui for configuring a network device and there's a monitoring page. imagine 3 separate forms for configuring different monitoring options like snmp, email, syslog, etc.
[2014-04-29 11:33:01] joesmith: theyre all on the same page, but they configure different things and dont really make sense in the same form
[2014-04-29 11:34:04] phasze: So how is submitting a previous one a problem?  Seems like you should be able to determine which submit button to push for each section.

[2014-04-29 14:07:47] dude-x: well async_script certainly must have a default because you can set it

[2014-04-29 14:49:11] dude-x: yeah
[2014-04-29 14:49:17] lukeis: the only thing I notice about your JS is that the 'return' statement isn't necessary and your 'any_activity_yet' is just a flag to make sure it doesn't return on the first call?
[2014-04-29 14:49:55] AutomatedTester: ahh thats better https://gist.github.com/AutomatedTester/dca633b12008d335eb39
[2014-04-29 14:49:56] dude-x: right, there may be no activity so don't return yet; but once there is you can return

[2014-04-29 15:18:02] AutomatedTester: yeah
[2014-04-29 15:18:11] lukeis: nice
[2014-04-29 15:18:29] AutomatedTester: well... they look after automation that recreates certain real world scenarios
[2014-04-29 15:18:50] AutomatedTester: and that caught a weird crash which was exploitable
[2014-04-29 15:19:48] AutomatedTester: lukeis: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/BugHunter
[2014-04-29 15:21:02] AutomatedTester: that gives them the weird stuff and then they open the site in a debug build and try capture the crash
[2014-04-29 15:21:12] pawell: How do you look for elements ? I'm new and so far I was looking directly into the source code of website. Is there any better way to do it ?
[2014-04-29 15:21:46] AutomatedTester: pawell: that way or using the "Inspect Element" on the context menu of most browsers
