[2014-04-09 08:57:58] lukeis: umm, you might need to run something in python first, like the firefox test… ./go test_py

[2014-04-09 09:04:27] cgoldberg: lukeis, does chromedriver provide executables compiled for ARM?  If not, have you ever built chromedriver?
[2014-04-09 09:05:04] lukeis: i've built chromedriver, but it doesn't run on the emulator, it runs on a host pc and talks to (android)
[2014-04-09 09:06:08] lukeis: so, i don't think you can build it for ARM (but i really don't know for sure)
[2014-04-09 09:06:14] cgoldberg: lukeis, i want to run it directly on a device
[2014-04-09 09:06:32] cgoldberg: my test device arrives Friday, so I'll try then
[2014-04-09 09:06:56] lukeis: it's designed to use the Remote WebKit Debugging protocol to communicate
[2014-04-09 09:07:18] rorycb: cgoldberg, you can compile for arm and run on device. but I don't know the magic
[2014-04-09 09:07:21] lukeis: hmm, should it be called that still? ;)
[2014-04-09 09:07:53] cgoldberg: lukeis, right... but you can run it locally (on the device with browser)
[2014-04-09 09:08:08] lukeis: sure :)
[2014-04-09 09:08:23] lukeis: out of my area of expertise though
[2014-04-09 09:08:27] cgoldberg: if i can get it to compile on ARM :)
[2014-04-09 09:08:55] cgoldberg: if all the libs work on ARM, it should be no prob (famous last words)
