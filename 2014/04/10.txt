[2014-04-10 04:46:21] kub1x: Hey, I'd like to have a question about Selenium IDE. As a part of my diploma thesis I'm writing an extension to selenium. This adds new formatter and commands into the selenium API. But the use does not fit any of the selenium command types (Actions, Accessors and Assertions) as I need to add them without any AndWait variant or so. Is there any chance to add new command type into Selenium IDE via user extension? I've red through the code all the way to Comma

[2014-04-10 06:45:08] simonstewart: Since 8 is out and 6 has been EoL’d
[2014-04-10 06:45:35] barancev: you mean "we drop support java 6"
[2014-04-10 06:45:51] barancev: and compile the code with target=7
[2014-04-10 06:45:57] simonstewart: yes
[2014-04-10 06:46:11] barancev: any technical reasons?
[2014-04-10 06:46:19] barancev: what we get from this move?
[2014-04-10 06:46:50] simonstewart: There are some nice language features that it’d be nice to use
[2014-04-10 06:46:58] simonstewart: (try with resources is the biggie)

[2014-04-10 07:07:54] barancev: LoadableComponent is not a page, totally unrelated
[2014-04-10 07:08:21] barancev: you should do driver.get(...)
[2014-04-10 07:09:39] snifsnaf: hmm, even the javadoc says the following "Represents any abstraction of something that can be loaded. This may be an entire web page..."
[2014-04-10 07:10:05] snifsnaf: yes, we are loading widgets (e.g. a newsletter registration) at times, but othertimes its handy to load an entire page
[2014-04-10 07:12:11] barancev: LoadableComponent is an "internal" class, it is not a part of API, it is a part of PageObject patern implementation

[2014-04-10 07:14:37] barancev: chili_con_carne: what's the purpose?
[2014-04-10 07:15:23] chili_con_carne: I am noticing a form will let selenium enter in fields while its executing js to expand itself. Once the form has expanded fully it clears the field.
[2014-04-10 07:16:00] chili_con_carne: Selenium seems to enter the fields while the fields are 'partially' displayed
[2014-04-10 07:16:27] barancev: so a user can be hit with this "feature"
[2014-04-10 07:16:32] chili_con_carne: I am now checking to see if an element that should be displayed on the form exists and that seems to work but I am not sure how realible that is.
[2014-04-10 07:16:41] chili_con_carne: it happens in 1/100 of a second. they will never see it
[2014-04-10 07:17:31] alko: hello everyone, we came across a problem using native clicks in IE8 which is a known selenium bug: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4403
[2014-04-10 07:17:42] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-10 07:17:54] alko: i would look into fixing it myself, but dimacus tells me that is all C++ code and I need MSVC to work on it
[2014-04-10 07:17:59] alko: which I don't have.
[2014-04-10 07:18:13] barancev: I did not understand -- "the fields are 'partially' displayed" and "populate a field if it is not displayed" -- is it displayed or not? and what do you want selenium to do?
[2014-04-10 07:18:17] alko: is this something we should think will be fixed eventually or should we just plan on workaround?
[2014-04-10 07:19:25] barancev: alko: does requireWindowFocus=true help?
[2014-04-10 07:19:40] chili_con_carne: for a split second you can see them but only part of the animation. At this point would they be considered display? Would someWebElement.isDisplayed() evaluate to true?
[2014-04-10 07:19:58] alko: dunno, we did a different workaround
[2014-04-10 07:20:02] chili_con_carne: I don't want selenium to do any more then it currently can I am seeking clarification in my understanding of the system.
[2014-04-10 07:20:10] alko: i could take a look into that
[2014-04-10 07:20:18] chili_con_carne: it is currently* of the api*
[2014-04-10 07:20:22] alko: it is a bit weird since it works on other versions of IE
[2014-04-10 07:20:29] alko: and on every other browser
[2014-04-10 07:20:29] barancev: chili_con_carne: wait until the form is fully expanded before you enter data
[2014-04-10 07:21:23] chili_con_carne: so form.isDisplayed?

[2014-04-10 07:22:13] barancev: chili_con_carne: "expand: is whatever you mean by "its executing js to expand itself"
[2014-04-10 07:22:13] alko: i'll take a look at that fix

[2014-04-10 12:15:50] jimevans: but that's just my opinion

[2014-04-10 12:16:58] jimevans: jleyba: that would certainly simplify the atoms for them (and make them faster too)

[2014-04-10 12:18:22] jimevans: but then, for the perfectly legitimate use case of wanting the calculated visible text of an element, do we force the user to implement it themselves?
[2014-04-10 12:18:59] lukeis: "value" really being the property right? (of course I already proved that the attribute is actually the same thing to browsers… so either would work)

[2014-04-10 13:59:48] jleyba: pixelport: what browser are you after?
[2014-04-10 14:00:15] pixelport: firefox
[2014-04-10 14:00:16] lukeis: pixelport: so, it all depends on browser on how to try to detect it… Firefox is the only one I know how
[2014-04-10 14:00:23] jleyba: no official reference, just need to know implementation details for the various drivers (so very much not discoverable and subject to change)
[2014-04-10 14:00:27] kub1x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-10 14:00:32] jleyba: If all you care about is firefox, then:
[2014-04-10 14:00:35] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't tag itself into any DOM as far as i'm aware.
[2014-04-10 14:01:01] jleyba: if (document.documentElement.getAttribute('webdriver') === 'true' || window.navigator.webdriver === true) console.log("HELLO, WEBDRIVER")
[2014-04-10 14:01:13] pixelport: I will try it
[2014-04-10 14:01:41] jleyba: The first clause should catch the current FirefoxDriver. The second should catch Marionette (assuming AutomatedTester implemented his own fingerprint section)
[2014-04-10 14:02:01] AutomatedTester: I havent implemented it yet

[2014-04-10 14:02:39] pixelport: nope
[2014-04-10 14:03:13] pixelport: There is also no webdriver='true' attribute
[2014-04-10 14:03:24] pixelport: visible in inspector
[2014-04-10 14:03:31] jleyba: Hm
[2014-04-10 14:03:39] lukeis: looking that the <html> tag?
[2014-04-10 14:03:42] lukeis: i see it
[2014-04-10 14:03:43] pixelport: yes
[2014-04-10 14:04:06] pixelport: I am using firefox
[2014-04-10 14:04:13] lukeis: so am i ;)
[2014-04-10 14:04:42] pixelport: How about Chrome?
[2014-04-10 14:05:12] pixelport: I am trying to be really stealthy
[2014-04-10 14:05:27] jimevans: uh-oh.
[2014-04-10 14:06:54] jimevans: pixelport: well that begs the question. are you trying to detect webdriver, or use it and avoid being detected? and why do you feel the need to be stealthy?
[2014-04-10 14:07:22] pixelport: I am trying to automate a banking website. Nothing fancy.
[2014-04-10 14:07:40] jimevans: are you working for the bank in question?
[2014-04-10 14:07:54] pixelport: Yes
[2014-04-10 14:08:03] lukeis: the if clause jason gave does not work 'in-line' as the page is loading, you have to wait for the document to be 'ready'
[2014-04-10 14:08:32] jimevans: i ask, because otherwise using webdriver against many sites would violate their terms of service.
[2014-04-10 14:09:06] pixelport: We have a fancy bot detection. Flash Objects, javascript creation of Fonts and validating their heights and much more
[2014-04-10 14:09:25] EthanHuntAgain, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-10 14:09:30] pixelport: and I should see if the system is secure
[2014-04-10 14:09:57] pixelport: or how much effort is necessary to beat it
[2014-04-10 14:11:05] pixelport: What do you think?
[2014-04-10 14:11:49] AutomatedTester: I did toy with the idea of forcing the browser to add a header when its doing a http connection
[2014-04-10 14:12:01] AutomatedTester: that would allow easier blocking
[2014-04-10 14:12:07] jleyba: I don't know how many browsers adhere to this, but there is the isTrusted attributed on events in DOM3

[2014-04-10 14:12:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we use it to secure FirefoxOS
[2014-04-10 14:12:56] jleyba: That would catch things like Selenium RC or other automation libraries that rely on synthetic events
[2014-04-10 14:13:00] AutomatedTester: synthetic events dont allow people to log in
[2014-04-10 14:13:17] pixelport: And does selenium fire trusted events?
[2014-04-10 14:13:19] AutomatedTester: but the check for that is in the browser chrome

[2014-04-10 14:19:54] jimevans: in certain configurations, the IE driver simulates mouse and keyboard input using the system (OS-level) input queue. there is literally no difference between that simulation and using a physical mouse or keyboard, as far as windows is concerned.
[2014-04-10 14:20:35] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-04-10 14:20:51] jimevans: pixelport: how?
[2014-04-10 14:21:09] jimevans: as far as IE is concerned, it's getting messages from the system input queue.
[2014-04-10 14:21:39] barancev: the same for FF with native events
[2014-04-10 14:22:13] pixelport: jimevans: for example if you move the mouse via moveToElement only the hover event is fired for the given element
[2014-04-10 14:22:18] jimevans: i'm thinking of the SendInput code path, which is IE-only, but the other native events code paths are different.
[2014-04-10 14:22:27] jimevans: pixelport: not true at all
[2014-04-10 14:22:28] pixelport: but not for the elements on their way moving

[2014-04-10 15:23:38] jimevans: that's the point of native events. they use the OS-level mechanisms for simulating input to the browser, which means the driver doesn't have to guess what order the events should be fired in.

[2014-04-10 15:51:32] jimevans: it's identical to if the user clicked, and didn't move the mouse from over the element.
[2014-04-10 15:52:05] pixelport: but the mouseout event should not be fired then
[2014-04-10 15:52:09] pixelport: but it did
[2014-04-10 15:53:07] jimevans: if you say so.
[2014-04-10 15:53:39] pixelport: jimevans: There is the mistake. If the user didn't move the mouse from the element the mouseout event should not have been fired
[2014-04-10 15:53:50] pixelport: I got you
[2014-04-10 15:54:14] jimevans: if you really want to pretend you can detect that appropriately without generating false positives, be my guest.

[2014-04-10 15:54:39] jimevans: plus, you've only validated firefox.
[2014-04-10 15:54:45] jimevans: that's far from conclusive
[2014-04-10 15:54:50] AutomatedTester: (!listenerWindow.location) || (listenerWindow.location && listenerWindow.location.href != message.json.href
[2014-04-10 15:55:12] AutomatedTester: is the (!listenerWindow.location) superfulous?

[2014-04-10 15:59:14] pixelport: On chrome the events are exactly fired in the same way like firefox
[2014-04-10 15:59:32] pixelport: So my detection could probably work
[2014-04-10 16:00:07] pixelport: when the button is selected via tab and submittet via enter only the click event is fired
