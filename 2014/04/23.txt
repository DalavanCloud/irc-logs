[2014-04-23 14:47:19] ato: dude-x: If it's easy to supply a test beforehand, I usually will because it forces me to think about the scope of my task.
[2014-04-23 14:48:56] ato: dude-x: But for other things, especially when the scope is unclear, it's difficult to know the exact requirements.
[2014-04-23 14:48:56] ato: For example if you're exploring a new system you don't know, it might be difficult to know what the right solution is.
[2014-04-23 14:48:56] ato: Consequently it will be difficult to make assertions about that system.
