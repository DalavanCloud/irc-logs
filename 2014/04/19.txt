[2014-04-19 08:10:28] user351651: Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/server-standalone.jar
[2014-04-19 08:11:21] user351651: what should I do? Shouldn't it be a standalone server already? when I downloaded a compiled jar file, it was around 30 megabytes and it worked 'out of the box'. But that file from above is only around 8 mb and it doesnt work
