[2014-04-08 03:54:13] Dave_B_: or css, or id, or class name etc
[2014-04-08 03:54:20] Dave_B_: then click em!

[2014-04-08 03:57:42] barancev|2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-08 03:58:08] Dave_B_: the same css? You can pick elements by position etc with css if you like
[2014-04-08 03:58:14] Dave_B_: but generally it's not desirable
[2014-04-08 03:58:18] WhereIsMySpoon: id rather not
[2014-04-08 03:58:23] Dave_B_: probably xpath sounds fine for your uses
[2014-04-08 03:58:24] WhereIsMySpoon: better to pick by value
[2014-04-08 03:58:45] Dave_B_: you can use css if they've got a value too :p

[2014-04-08 04:13:03] putenbrust: is there a number , how much more time it take to make a test automatet instat to test manuel,.. like 1,5x 2x or even 3x ... i cant find any dokument on the web
[2014-04-08 04:13:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 797
[2014-04-08 04:18:22] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: it totally depends on what you're doing
[2014-04-08 04:18:49] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: however, the time taken to do tests is not really the most important part
[2014-04-08 04:19:01] WhereIsMySpoon: the important part is that you have the exact same environment and actions every time
[2014-04-08 04:19:12] WhereIsMySpoon: which means your tests (and thus your results) are consistent
[2014-04-08 04:19:17] putenbrust: the most importand part should be the quality , but if the coast are to high...
[2014-04-08 04:19:19] WhereIsMySpoon: humans are fallible
[2014-04-08 04:19:29] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: with any new software, it takes time to learn
[2014-04-08 04:19:46] WhereIsMySpoon: if you're already familiar with programming it shouldnt take that long
[2014-04-08 04:19:57] WhereIsMySpoon: if you aren't, it will obviously take a while to actually learn programming first
[2014-04-08 04:20:13] WhereIsMySpoon: any progrmamer worth their salt should be able to get stuck into a new library
[2014-04-08 04:20:19] WhereIsMySpoon: and this library is fairly easy to use
[2014-04-08 04:20:24] WhereIsMySpoon: imo
[2014-04-08 04:21:58] putenbrust: the problem is , u can not write a test depends on the documation of the software, the doc is to bad. so u need to capture klicks , and extend the thest with manual coding
[2014-04-08 04:22:18] putenbrust: *documentation of the software in our company
[2014-04-08 04:22:26] WhereIsMySpoon: all coding is manual
[2014-04-08 04:22:35] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant just wave a wand and have code fall in your lap
[2014-04-08 04:22:58] putenbrust: and i just want to automate the base system , it seems for me to be the best way, addons will be testet manualyx
[2014-04-08 04:23:15] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: if your website is not test friendly then yes you will need to spend time making it more friendly (adding ids, adding window names etc)
[2014-04-08 04:23:19] WhereIsMySpoon: ive had to do the same
[2014-04-08 04:23:21] putenbrust: cause the addons are different for each project
[2014-04-08 04:23:27] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont feel it's really a big issue
[2014-04-08 04:24:25] andy_seit: Is adding a .Displayed property to SelectElement like this a bad idea?  Just so I don't have to expose both versions of the element (or rely on consumers to cast)
[2014-04-08 04:24:27] andy_seit: http://pastebin.com/kz0cMi0H
[2014-04-08 04:24:28] putenbrust: but i need so make an analyse of coasts & time, how much time it would take to automate one part of the system, by the highest grade of quality :/
[2014-04-08 04:25:07] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: so get a programmer to do a proof of concept and automate a few things
[2014-04-08 04:25:14] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant know unless u try
[2014-04-08 04:25:39] WhereIsMySpoon: andy_seit: why are you adding a displayed property
[2014-04-08 04:25:47] WhereIsMySpoon: just so I know what your goal is
[2014-04-08 04:25:50] putenbrust: lol :D thats my work for the intership
[2014-04-08 04:26:02] putenbrust: i need to try
[2014-04-08 04:26:16] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: so ask your manager if you can automate a couple things so you get a rough estimate
[2014-04-08 04:26:30] andy_seit: Np, So I can just expose the element as one thing.  There are tests defined to check for it's visibility.
[2014-04-08 04:26:32] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know how good a programmer you are or how familar u are with ur system
[2014-04-08 04:26:32] putenbrust: but i think i will change the tool to sahi, the ide is more friendly and works better on our site with the ajax and a lot of frames
[2014-04-08 04:26:51] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: are you using the firefox selenium ide?
[2014-04-08 04:26:57] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-04-08 04:26:59] putenbrust: i am not even so good as i need to but i will learn
[2014-04-08 04:27:07] putenbrust: selenium ide and selenium builder
[2014-04-08 04:27:09] WhereIsMySpoon: andy_seit: you can already check for elements visibility
[2014-04-08 04:27:11] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: dont
[2014-04-08 04:27:18] putenbrust: on our master base projekt they both dont work
[2014-04-08 04:27:22] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: code your tests with real code rather than the deprecated ide
[2014-04-08 04:27:27] WhereIsMySpoon: they work a lot better
[2014-04-08 04:27:39] andy_seit: WhereIsMySpoon: Absolutely, but not after it's cast to a select
[2014-04-08 04:27:42] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
[2014-04-08 04:27:49] andy_seit: Unless I'm being absurdly dim
[2014-04-08 04:28:14] WhereIsMySpoon: (new WebDriverWait(driver, 60)).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("mySelectId")));
[2014-04-08 04:28:16] WhereIsMySpoon: thats java
[2014-04-08 04:28:18] WhereIsMySpoon: but u get the idea
[2014-04-08 04:28:27] putenbrust: Spoon, its seems to me that it would take more time instat of extend the test of the captured stuff
[2014-04-08 04:28:38] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: "the captured stuff"?
[2014-04-08 04:28:42] WhereIsMySpoon: what are u talkin about sorry
[2014-04-08 04:29:17] JamesPrescott: WhereIsMySpoon: Possibly the stuff recorded in the IDE
[2014-04-08 04:29:20] putenbrust: it would take more time to code the test  instat of taking the code of the captured testcase and extend it
[2014-04-08 04:29:23] andy_seit: That doesn't really work with our framework, its a "zero friction" UI map exposure, so the consumers want PaymentSelector.Displayed or similar
[2014-04-08 04:29:31] WhereIsMySpoon: eh
[2014-04-08 04:29:49] WhereIsMySpoon: andy_seit: but implicit waits are the way you do this sort of thing

[2014-04-08 04:30:19] WhereIsMySpoon: ask any of the selenium dudes
[2014-04-08 04:30:21] WhereIsMySpoon: they will say thte same
[2014-04-08 04:30:23] JamesPrescott: Yep, it's all about the webdriver
[2014-04-08 04:30:33] WhereIsMySpoon: putenbrust: the IDE can be thought of as a jump start
[2014-04-08 04:30:35] putenbrust: hmm so i maybe dont need to use sahi :/
[2014-04-08 04:30:38] WhereIsMySpoon: it is useful to start off with
[2014-04-08 04:30:44] WhereIsMySpoon: but dont use it for anything proper
[2014-04-08 04:30:44] andy_seit: Thanks spoon, I think I have my answer.  The help's much appreciated.

[2014-04-08 07:10:01] ato: So what that's doing is to first look up div.main, then look for answer inside that.
[2014-04-08 07:10:18] ato: That should be fine, but it can be shortened to only make one lookup by doing "div.main answer".

[2014-04-08 07:10:53] ato: The problem in the exception wasn't about the locator though, but that the element reference you fetch using that has disappeared from the DOM.

[2014-04-08 09:42:46] WhereIsMySpoon: test_function() is executing that function

[2014-04-08 09:51:25] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: ha ha
[2014-04-08 09:51:44] WhereIsMySpoon: we still have clients that insist on using compat mode in ie8
[2014-04-08 09:51:49] WhereIsMySpoon: which is ie6 really
[2014-04-08 09:52:20] Dave_B_: install chrome or firefox, replace the icon with the IE icon, don't tell them.
[2014-04-08 09:52:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: we have no control over their installs :p
[2014-04-08 09:52:55] Dave_B_: rats :(
[2014-04-08 09:52:57] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-04-08 09:53:08] gfatori: I want to change my user_agent on my webdriver object on the fly, is that possible? without instantiating a new webdriver object
[2014-04-08 09:53:27] gfatori: can anyone please help me with that?
[2014-04-08 09:53:41] *WhereIsMySpoon has no idea what a user agent is'
[2014-04-08 09:53:51] Dave_B_: who you're pretending to be
[2014-04-08 09:54:01] WhereIsMySpoon: I am always me
[2014-04-08 09:54:02] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2014-04-08 09:54:13] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: what do you mean by that
[2014-04-08 09:54:23] WhereIsMySpoon: I can pretend to be someone else in a myriad of different ways
[2014-04-08 09:55:14] Dave_B_: like, most internet explorers by default admit to it, IE 11 lies about it
[2014-04-08 09:55:20] Dave_B_: that kind of thing
[2014-04-08 09:55:54] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: ??
[2014-04-08 09:55:56] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused
[2014-04-08 09:55:57] jimevans: gfatori: webdriver doesn't provide a global (meaning applicable to every browser) method of changing the user agent string.
[2014-04-08 09:56:26] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, so the user agent for firefox would be "firefox"
[2014-04-08 09:56:26] jimevans: and certainly doesn't provide a way to change it after the browser has been launched.
[2014-04-08 09:56:39] gfatori: oh ok. thx
[2014-04-08 09:57:20] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: every browser sends what's called a "user agent string" as part of its headers, identifying itself when requesting pages from a web server
[2014-04-08 09:57:32] WhereIsMySpoon: yea i just wiki'd it
[2014-04-08 09:57:56] Dave_B_: frefox might look like 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0' or something, so a bit more than just the browser
[2014-04-08 09:58:21] WhereIsMySpoon: yea well...I just meant the gist :D
[2014-04-08 09:58:24] WhereIsMySpoon: but thanks
[2014-04-08 09:59:06] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-08 10:00:04] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: is there a way to, in a fluent wait, do something like "keep doing the stuff in the apply() method until a certain condition is met"?

[2014-04-08 10:00:43] WhereIsMySpoon: or would I have to build an expectedconditions to do that
[2014-04-08 10:00:48] jimevans: that's pretty much what a fluent wait does.

[2014-04-08 10:01:39] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: er..at the moment I've got apply() { if(someCondition) { return driver.findElement(By.id("someid")); } return null; }
[2014-04-08 10:01:54] WhereIsMySpoon: is that right or am i missing something

[2014-04-08 10:02:38] gimpneek, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-04-08 10:02:53] jimevans: if memory serves, that's correct, but you need to be sure to set up the fluent wait to ignore the correct exceptions.
[2014-04-08 10:03:02] WhereIsMySpoon: oh ok
[2014-04-08 10:03:06] WhereIsMySpoon: so if it returns null it keeps on doing the wait
[2014-04-08 10:03:09] jimevans: because findElement will throw
[2014-04-08 10:03:13] WhereIsMySpoon: oh ofc
[2014-04-08 10:03:16] WhereIsMySpoon: duhh
[2014-04-08 10:03:28] WhereIsMySpoon: wait
[2014-04-08 10:03:29] WhereIsMySpoon: no it wont
[2014-04-08 10:03:35] WhereIsMySpoon: not if someCondition is false

[2014-04-08 10:04:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ah i know what I need to do
[2014-04-08 10:04:36] WhereIsMySpoon: I need to set up an expectedconditions
[2014-04-08 10:04:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that just checks someCondition
[2014-04-08 10:04:49] WhereIsMySpoon: that way I dont need to return an element
[2014-04-08 10:05:06] WhereIsMySpoon: ah wait no..they have an apply() too
[2014-04-08 10:05:08] WhereIsMySpoon: ugh
[2014-04-08 10:05:37] jimevans: all "ExpectedConditions" methods do is return a pointer to a function that's called by the until() method.
[2014-04-08 10:05:45] alko2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-08 10:05:58] WhereIsMySpoon: AHA I know
[2014-04-08 10:06:18] WhereIsMySpoon: I will do if(!someCondition) { throw new BlahException(); }
[2014-04-08 10:06:27] WhereIsMySpoon: then ignore that exception
[2014-04-08 10:07:05] jimevans: so if i understand the java fluent wait implementation properly, the until() method calls the apply() method repeatedly until it either throws an unhandled and unignored exception, times out, or returns a non-null value.
[2014-04-08 10:07:14] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-04-08 10:07:14] alko1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2014-04-08 10:07:20] WhereIsMySpoon: it will keep going if it returns a null value?
[2014-04-08 10:07:27] jimevans: i believe so.
[2014-04-08 10:07:28] WhereIsMySpoon: that isnt immediately obvious
[2014-04-08 10:07:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ima test this out tomorrow
[2014-04-08 10:07:55] WhereIsMySpoon: thanks jim
[2014-04-08 10:07:56] WhereIsMySpoon: o7
[2014-04-08 10:09:40] jimevans: again, it's been awhile since i looked into the java implementation, so i may be slightly mistaken.

[2014-04-08 10:10:25] ato: It will try again if it returns null or false, actually.
[2014-04-08 10:10:42] jimevans: ah that's right.
[2014-04-08 10:10:46] jimevans: false also.

[2014-04-08 10:11:53] *jleyba has been avoiding writing explicit waits for webdriverjs'
[2014-04-08 10:12:17] ato: How do you avoid it?
[2014-04-08 10:12:38] bluescreen100, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-08 10:12:42] jimevans: i knew there was a generic version of waits in .NET that acted that way, i was just unsure about the internals of the java implementation
[2014-04-08 10:13:14] jimevans: ato: i believe the promises api sorta-kinda helps mitigate some of that.
[2014-04-08 10:13:14] jleyba: ato I meant I haven't added explicit waits to the library
[2014-04-08 10:13:25] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 787
[2014-04-08 10:13:38] ato: Oh right.  I don't know anything about promises.
[2014-04-08 10:13:55] jleyba: Nah, they don't really help
[2014-04-08 10:13:59] *jimevans doesn't know much about them either.'
[2014-04-08 10:14:12] jimevans: oh well, that was just me speaking off the cuff.
[2014-04-08 10:14:20] jleyba: promises -> java.util.concurrent.Future
[2014-04-08 10:14:28] jleyba: (assuming you're familiar with those)
[2014-04-08 10:14:39] jimevans: lesson the first: always assume jimevans doesn't know what he's talking about.
[2014-04-08 10:14:48] ato: It's possible the Marionette JS bindings have something similar to the expected conditions, but I haven't done any work on the client JS bits.
[2014-04-08 10:15:06] jleyba: does Marionette have a stable protocol yet?
[2014-04-08 10:15:14] ato: Nope.
[2014-04-08 10:15:29] jleyba: I want to add native Firefox support for Node, but I'm not going to mess with the current FirefoxDriver since Marionette is right around the corner
[2014-04-08 10:15:36] ato: The formal end points are in sync with the spec (and with Selenium 2) now, but not the individual arguments.
[2014-04-08 10:15:40] jimevans: did that frames bug every make it into nightly?

[2014-04-08 10:16:10] ato: jimevans: You'd need to ask AutomatedTester.  I've been distracted by the Firefox OS certification test suite.

[2014-04-08 10:16:46] jimevans: firefox os has taken priority over everything until now.
[2014-04-08 10:16:51] ato: The temporary WIP patch works pretty well though.
[2014-04-08 10:16:54] jimevans: (and still does, i'd guess)
[2014-04-08 10:17:06] ato: Yeah.  Yay firedrills.
[2014-04-08 10:17:19] ato: I'm returning to Marionette work probably next week though.
[2014-04-08 10:17:30] ato: Mozilla is engaging Accenture (!) to write the tests.
[2014-04-08 10:17:54] jimevans: o rly?
[2014-04-08 10:18:07] ato: s/Accenture/Accindenture/, sorry.
[2014-04-08 10:18:29] jimevans: can i specify that none of my donation to the mozilla foundation be used to pay them? :)
[2014-04-08 10:19:11] ato: I think they're officially paid by some phone manufacturerer we work with, and they offered to lend us a hand.
[2014-04-08 10:19:18] ato: -er

[2014-04-08 11:55:10] jimevans: if you're using Java, it'd look like this: ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript(<your data retrieval stuff here>);
[2014-04-08 11:55:20] aboudreault: python
[2014-04-08 11:55:29] aboudreault: checking for something similar
[2014-04-08 11:55:31] jimevans: then it's driver.execute_script(...)
[2014-04-08 11:55:41] lukeis: driver.execute_script("return call_sekrit_method();")
[2014-04-08 11:56:03] jimevans: which allows you to execute arbitrary javascript and return the values back to your calling python code.
[2014-04-08 11:56:13] aboudreault: Ok. thanks, checking this.

[2014-04-08 12:35:53] jimevans: i.e. "run as administrator"?

[2014-04-08 15:25:49] chrismcmahon: smccarthy2:  eh, long story. last week I had an element that was fine in FF but generated the "other element would receive the click" msg. from Chrome.  but clicking the parent element worked in Chrome but only did focus not click in FF. This week I have a mobile view of a web thing where Chrome sees an ajax progress bar but Firefox just will not recognize the element at any level.  browsers suck.
[2014-04-08 15:27:25] AutomatedTester: chrismcmahon: interop is hard
[2014-04-08 15:27:29] AutomatedTester: lets go shopping
[2014-04-08 15:27:43] chrismcmahon: AutomatedTester: hahaha yep
[2014-04-08 15:27:52] jimevans: AutomatedTester: +1
[2014-04-08 15:28:41] chrismcmahon: AutomatedTester:  so last week I bit the bullet and wrote a conditional on the locator, this week I just want to strangle Firefox, like "CAN'T YOU SEE IT?  IT'S RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU!!"
[2014-04-08 15:29:04] AutomatedTester: chrismcmahon: welcome to my life
[2014-04-08 15:30:02] chrismcmahon: AutomatedTester: admittedly, I have a mobile web interface that gives me a status message AND a progress bar AND a spinner while uploading an image.  it might be a tad busy.
[2014-04-08 15:30:32] AutomatedTester: chrismcmahon: so the visibility code can't handle the Z index of elements
[2014-04-08 15:30:50] AutomatedTester: because browsers can't tell you where the item is
[2014-04-08 15:31:25] AutomatedTester: I have a number of bugs against me for this scenario
[2014-04-08 15:31:39] AutomatedTester: luckily mobile isnt the future
[2014-04-08 15:31:43] AutomatedTester: its a fad
[2014-04-08 15:31:47] AutomatedTester: amirite?
[2014-04-08 15:31:53] jimevans: no. wait. the other thing.

[2014-04-08 15:37:43] AutomatedTester: chrismcmahon: it will be solved by me adding "is this interactable" to WebDriver
[2014-04-08 15:38:19] chrismcmahon: AutomatedTester: I have heard rumors of the "interactable" magic coming, I'm looking forward to it.
