[2014-11-25 03:38:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ato, barancev, AutomatedTester - is there some way to open multiple instances of WebDriver (so that multiple windows will open) and log into the same webapp without each new login overwriting the old session? In essence, is there a way to separate instances of each browser window so that sessions arent shared across them like they would be normally

[2014-11-25 03:48:06] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: I want to be able to have separate sessions active for the same browser but over multiple windows
[2014-11-25 03:48:59] nirvdrum: Ahh, well that's browser dependent then, I believe.  It should work fine in Firefox since each browser starts with its own profile.
[2014-11-25 03:49:14] nirvdrum: Harder with IE because they share the same cookie store, I believe.

[2014-11-25 07:01:38] Stevesan: the cookies present but this Selenium eaitFor doesnt work with it
[2014-11-25 07:01:46] Stevesan: waitFor*
[2014-11-25 07:03:30] relyt: I would look at the cookie specification to determine if the cookie I am attempting to access has the appropriate attributes set.
[2014-11-25 07:03:58] relyt: If you are trying to create a cookie to be read by that server, you require a cookie that has the appropriate flags set(ie., isHttpOnly, isSecure, Expiry, DateCreated)
[2014-11-25 07:05:38] Stevesan: the cookie is set via javascript and I want Selenium IDE to wait for it
[2014-11-25 07:06:11] Stevesan: it is not a session cookie or httpOnly or anything alike, as far as I can see
[2014-11-25 07:06:38] relyt: Can you use Javascript's setTimeout to wait an indeterminate number of seconds for the cookie?
[2014-11-25 07:06:48] relyt: and use javascript to do your... thing with the IDE.

[2014-11-25 07:07:10] relyt: I'm not sure about how the IDE works at all, mate.
[2014-11-25 07:07:22] Stevesan: i can simply pause the testcase
[2014-11-25 07:07:36] Stevesan: I ll try, if that solves the problem,... cause it msut be a timing problem
[2014-11-25 07:07:44] relyt: yeah man... selenium IDE and timing.
[2014-11-25 07:07:54] relyt: or asynchronous programming, network sockets, and waiting for the pipes to fill up.
[2014-11-25 07:07:58] Stevesan: but "hardcoded" timeouts, pauses are never really good on the long term :)
[2014-11-25 07:08:08] relyt: ^that's what I liken it to... plumbing...^ no cookie in your pipe
[2014-11-25 07:08:11] WhereIsMySpoon: Stevesan: the IDE itself isnt good in the long term
[2014-11-25 07:08:31] relyt: it seems good for recording and optimizing certain page heuristics which can be used outside of the IDE.
[2014-11-25 07:08:57] relyt: my selenium workflow right now is open an HTTPRequest to a page, then pick elements out of it and process with regular expressions // interact with forms.
[2014-11-25 07:09:10] relyt: I'm moving the regex to BeautifulSoup later... when I have time to learn.
[2014-11-25 07:09:14] Stevesan: hehe, this sometimes already escalated into a philosophical question wether to use IDE or Webdriver... its liek with statistics. you always can make one to prove your issue ;-))

[2014-11-25 07:10:54] relyt: at my skill level of coding, I am making things with Selenium that do stuff that will break on any significant change to the XPATH tree of the page.
[2014-11-25 07:10:54] Stevesan: well, I maintain a suite of almost 120 testcase with Selenium IDE and still can have my project managers to run them and understand them from time to time
[2014-11-25 07:11:14] Stevesan: which is great in small companies, where u dont have specialists for a certain task, sometimes

[2014-11-25 07:11:43] Stevesan: I dont use xpath locators at all anymore
[2014-11-25 07:11:46] Stevesan: only css
[2014-11-25 07:11:50] Stevesan: way better
[2014-11-25 07:11:56] relyt: it is.... but sometimes CSS is undefined.
[2014-11-25 07:12:05] Stevesan: use attributes?
[2014-11-25 07:12:14] relyt: can I use "Value?"
[2014-11-25 07:12:19] Stevesan: or what u mean with undefined?
[2014-11-25 07:12:29] relyt: maybe my setup is disfunctional... i cant do find_element_by_value
[2014-11-25 07:12:31] relyt: maybe you mean

[2014-11-25 07:14:30] Stevesan: i woudl use the id and give selenium ide the value
[2014-11-25 07:14:33] relyt: so then I just increment through the list
[2014-11-25 07:14:38] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-25 07:14:56] relyt: so selenium ide will just... pick the elements out for me and show the code like a UIAutomation "Spy"?
[2014-11-25 07:15:04] relyt: that inspects... tells me what i would need to code to do that.
[2014-11-25 07:15:37] Stevesan: uhm.. hang on,.. i need a second to look it up, how I do the selection... dont do it that often

[2014-11-25 07:17:45] Stevesan: Aye. I dont use the recorder of selenium ID too. I "code" all commands by hand. much more reliable, especially when it comes to the locators

[2014-11-25 07:19:26] JimboSlice: so now we either has to teach the frontenders python or switch over to a language they know or are familiar with ie. js/java
[2014-11-25 07:19:26] WhereIsMySpoon: so java, python, ruby, .net
[2014-11-25 07:19:31] WhereIsMySpoon: javascript
[2014-11-25 07:19:37] WhereIsMySpoon: those are all officially supported bindings
[2014-11-25 07:19:44] WhereIsMySpoon: i recommend AGAINST using php bindings
[2014-11-25 07:20:21] relyt: javascript coulde be nice...
[2014-11-25 07:20:38] relyt: I am enjoying Python
[2014-11-25 07:20:46] relyt: because I have the ultimate easy mode with it...
[2014-11-25 07:21:14] relyt: driver = webdriver.PhantomJS(); driver.get(URL); driver.save_screenshot('screenshot.png')
[2014-11-25 07:21:38] relyt: then I build my code between driver.get and driver.save_screenshot... constantly checking the last result of my interaction while selecting with an XPATH inspector in my browse.r
[2014-11-25 07:21:55] relyt: so really for me it's just a matter of trial and error... i know some things will work... other thing i try will not and those get commented out.
[2014-11-25 07:22:56] JimboSlice: try to stay away from xpath
[2014-11-25 07:23:05] relyt: what if there is no ID?
[2014-11-25 07:23:09] relyt: no CSS Class?
[2014-11-25 07:23:14] relyt: no Attributes?
[2014-11-25 07:23:29] relyt: a lot of these sites are dynamically generated and just have... nothing to go by except xpath
[2014-11-25 07:23:30] JimboSlice: if that's the case the frontender(s) need an asswhopping
[2014-11-25 07:23:40] relyt: they are doing it on purpose m8
[2014-11-25 07:23:47] JimboSlice: yeah
[2014-11-25 07:23:48] Dave_B_: how are you finding it with xpath?
[2014-11-25 07:23:48] WhereIsMySpoon: relyt: wut
[2014-11-25 07:23:52] relyt: they are monopolizing the data... i didnt write that horrible site... i just want their DB.
[2014-11-25 07:24:09] relyt: opening a DOM inspector, right clicking the element, and selecting "Copy Minimal XPATH")
[2014-11-25 07:24:17] WhereIsMySpoon: relyt: so you're writing selenium code to try and steal data from a site?
[2014-11-25 07:24:22] relyt: whoa whoa
[2014-11-25 07:24:28] relyt: ok ok ok " steal " is a rough word

[2014-11-25 07:26:01] relyt: I'm going to deliver targeted FB ads through their API.
[2014-11-25 07:26:15] relyt: so my clients... they tell me... i want an ad for people who fit this demographic...
[2014-11-25 07:26:22] relyt: and i take an inner join from my database schema...
[2014-11-25 07:26:28] relyt: and i put it in the facebook api...
[2014-11-25 07:26:32] relyt: :)
[2014-11-25 07:26:35] relyt: there's my biz plan
[2014-11-25 07:26:43] kyoob: wonder why they'd make is so difficult to get at data in the dom...
[2014-11-25 07:26:51] relyt: there's no disclaimers...
[2014-11-25 07:26:58] relyt: nothing to tell me "scraping this is illegal"
[2014-11-25 07:27:02] relyt: i am very mindful of robots.txt

[2014-11-25 07:28:58] WhereIsMySpoon: "I'm appropriating the data for commercial enterprise... for my startup "
[2014-11-25 07:29:09] relyt: yes.
[2014-11-25 07:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: appropriating is just rewording steal
[2014-11-25 07:29:21] relyt: i'm like robin hood... except im just giving to myself.
[2014-11-25 07:29:21] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt yours to take
[2014-11-25 07:29:24] relyt: lol
[2014-11-25 07:29:32] relyt: why are you on this high horse about database rights?
[2014-11-25 07:29:33] WhereIsMySpoon: is it under a license which means you can use it?
[2014-11-25 07:29:35] relyt: the form is there to access the data.
[2014-11-25 07:29:45] WhereIsMySpoon: the data is there for you to take?
[2014-11-25 07:29:48] relyt: I access for 8 hours a day.
[2014-11-25 07:29:49] relyt: yes
[2014-11-25 07:29:54] relyt: it's public record.
[2014-11-25 07:29:57] WhereIsMySpoon: right ok
[2014-11-25 07:30:03] relyt: if they charge... through an API... I do not do.
[2014-11-25 07:30:05] WhereIsMySpoon: the way you were wording it sounded different
[2014-11-25 07:30:07] relyt: I do not scrape competor prices.
[2014-11-25 07:30:11] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry then
[2014-11-25 07:30:19] relyt: I do not do a whole host of activities which I am requested which... strike me a s wrong
[2014-11-25 07:30:25] relyt: i dont want to get my "pants sued off"
[2014-11-25 07:30:34] WhereIsMySpoon: relyt: sounds like your company is kinda shady
[2014-11-25 07:30:53] WhereIsMySpoon: but up to you
[2014-11-25 07:31:10] relyt: I just try to help people do whatever they do better and better.
[2014-11-25 07:31:25] relyt: so if they tell me they need to automate a lead generation process, I help them.
[2014-11-25 07:31:31] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2014-11-25 07:31:35] relyt: it's not like the pick of the litter or anything.
[2014-11-25 07:31:50] relyt: i dont always get glitzy projects working for guys with good heads on their shoulders.
[2014-11-25 07:32:06] relyt: sometimes it's the grimey projects that are backed by the people you know intuitively you can trust to pay.

[2014-11-25 08:17:52] kyoob: it could be the ide is just checking your session's cookies after the site loads and comparing it to the cookies before it made the request.  if you already had that cookie the lists would match.
[2014-11-25 08:18:02] kyoob: again, take that with a grain of salt.  i'm just guessing.

[2014-11-25 11:11:29] kyoob: doing webdriver with testng in java.  any way i can throw an exception that skips every test that hasn't run yet?
[2014-11-25 11:11:49] kyoob: like "oops, qa is down, let's just shut everything down quietly"
[2014-11-25 11:12:02] jleyba: kyoob if you use junit4 you could do that with a @Rule
[2014-11-25 11:12:26] kyoob: hmm, pretty well invested in testng at this point
[2014-11-25 11:12:33] jleyba: That's unfortunate
[2014-11-25 11:12:35] kyoob: but i'll use that as leverage in my googling.  :)

[2014-11-25 11:17:07] kyoob: looks like testng has a dependsOnMethods annotation.  i guess i can check qa before i run each real test method and have them all depend on the success of that.
[2014-11-25 11:20:09] jleyba: ugh...testng and it's non-hermetic crap
[2014-11-25 11:20:16] jleyba: you should really switch to junit4
[2014-11-25 11:20:39] aguynamedben, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-25 11:23:20] kyoob: nah, i like testng's dataprovider
[2014-11-25 11:23:57] jleyba: https://blogs.oracle.com/jacobc/entry/parameterized_unit_tests_with_junit
[2014-11-25 11:24:29] kyoob: it comes down to taste.  i'm just used to my xml's and annotations
[2014-11-25 11:24:37] kyoob: it isn't worth it to switch at this point
[2014-11-25 11:26:06] kyoob: anything you can do, i can do messier

[2014-11-25 11:37:05] river73: is there a way to preserve session between calls to driver.get(url) ?  or maybe i'm not asking the question right.  i'm trying to time how long it takes my page to load, and i'm getting redirected to login each time i run driver.get()

[2014-11-25 11:38:57] river73: or, where i'm using navigationStart = driver.execute_script("return window.performance.timing.navigationStart"), how can i make it wait until after navigation away from the login page back to the origin URL before doing that?
[2014-11-25 11:40:43] kyoob: if it's the same driver it should retain cookies, etc
[2014-11-25 11:44:57] kyoob: you're using driver to log in, then doing driver.get() on some secure page, right?
