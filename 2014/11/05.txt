[2014-11-05 02:52:34] MichaelG: Hi all, I'm trying to test for a name NOT being in a select drop down list. Thought I could use the stroreSelectOptions command to store the result as a string ${names} then use javascript indexOf to test if the name is in the string. Is this possible or is there a better way to assert a name is not in a dropdown?

[2014-11-05 03:04:02] WhereIsMySpoon: MichaelG: I would suggest to him that you would be much more productive, gain more stable tests and would overall save money in the medium-long term if you switched to using webdriver

[2014-11-05 10:07:19] jleyba: dimacus: need to update guava?
[2014-11-05 10:07:58] dimacus: no, need to get dd-plist.jar added. a Google library to read/write plists on OSX… it happens to be that the extensions enable/disable lives in a plist
[2014-11-05 10:08:23] harglbargl, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-05 10:08:34] dimacus: easy way, read the plist as string and do a regex to see if value is 1/0… better way read it, try to change it
[2014-11-05 10:08:40] jleyba: dimacus: drop the jar into third_party/java/plist
[2014-11-05 10:08:54] dimacus: done
[2014-11-05 10:08:59] jleyba: copy third_party/java/guava-libraries/build.desc to third_party/java/plist/build.desc - should be obvious what changes to make to it
[2014-11-05 10:09:01] dimacus: adding a BUCK and build.desc file now
[2014-11-05 10:09:11] jleyba: ignore buck, that's simon's thing
[2014-11-05 10:09:47] jleyba: add "//third_party/java/plist" to the deps in java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/safari/build.desc
[2014-11-05 10:10:30] dimacus: done
[2014-11-05 10:11:14] jleyba: that's it for crazy fun
[2014-11-05 10:11:26] jleyba: you'll probably want to create a library in intellij to import the jar
[2014-11-05 10:11:41] dimacus: adding it to .classpath is not enough?
[2014-11-05 10:11:55] jleyba: w/e makes intellij happy :)
[2014-11-05 10:12:02] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: you've clearly not had any contact with simonstewart about maven.

Non-standard platform values can cause matching issues on Grid, but they can be usable for third-party Grid implementations
[2014-11-05 10:12:56] jimevans: as long as simonstewart is involved with this project in any way, it will not use maven for dependency management. full stop.

[2014-11-05 10:15:09] lukeis: i don't think we need maven… but having a artifact repository outside of source control *makes sense*
[2014-11-05 10:15:38] *jimevans shudders at the thought of using ant as the build tool for webdriver.'
[2014-11-05 10:15:55] lukeis: i'd rather use gradle
[2014-11-05 10:15:59] jleyba: lukeis: I prefer our model of keeping 3rd party artifacts so everyone knows they're building with the same versions
[2014-11-05 10:16:23] lukeis: same thing happens when you put those artifacts in another depo
[2014-11-05 10:16:49] jimevans: i'd rather have an external repo for our binary output components

[2014-11-05 10:20:21] jim31432423423: lukeis: thanks, right, that's what I'm doing. But there's a lot of data in the form of lists and dicts that I need to store somewhere
[2014-11-05 10:20:23] barancev: and we could use external repo for java deps too, I see nothing bad in this model too
[2014-11-05 10:20:45] jimevans: it's not just java

[2014-11-05 10:21:01] jim31432423423: I have multiple features which requires more or less the same setup-data
[2014-11-05 10:21:06] barancev: jimevans: :)
[2014-11-05 10:21:08] jleyba: barancev: not every java dep is in maven. for consistency just keep everything together
[2014-11-05 10:21:18] lukeis: jim31432423423: really depends on the data… i'm happy with it either living directly in code (maybe separate files) and / or loaded from other 'data' files you read from
[2014-11-05 10:21:34] jleyba: jimevans: It's not that I don't give a damn about .NET... I don't give a damn about Windows development :-)
[2014-11-05 10:21:47] jimevans: jleyba: take your pick
[2014-11-05 10:21:50] jim31432423423: I want to keep it DRY, easy maintainable/extensible (is that even a word?)
[2014-11-05 10:22:04] jim31432423423: and maniputable.. lol
[2014-11-05 10:22:34] jimevans: either way, i get the be the apologist for technologies that everyone in open-source development looks down their noses at, and insists don't matter.
[2014-11-05 10:22:37] jimevans: when they do
[2014-11-05 10:22:37] jim31432423423: ie, two scenarios might share 90% of the setup

[2014-11-05 13:20:02] dimacus: jimevans: did you have this much trouble adding support for IEDriver? or were the coms at least documented?
[2014-11-05 13:20:30] jimevans: dimacus: the COM interfaces are incredibly well documented.
[2014-11-05 13:20:37] jimevans: for IE
[2014-11-05 13:20:54] dimacus: yeah so that's what MS has on Apple
[2014-11-05 13:21:27] jimevans: well, MSFT cares about developers (or at least on the surface)
[2014-11-05 13:22:03] jleyba: Apple cares about the devs that generate revenue (so not Safari)
[2014-11-05 13:22:33] dimacus: jleyba: ok here is another aproach… compile the SafariDriver as a whitelisted/aproved extension. This way it can auto update by itself… though this feels weird bc reverting to previous version is a pain in the ass
[2014-11-05 13:23:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: MS has a lot more engineers than Apple
[2014-11-05 13:23:45] AutomatedTester: actually... Chromium has more DevRel than Apple has webkit engineers
[2014-11-05 13:25:31] jleyba: dimacus: you mean have users manually install the extension and we push updates when necessary?
[2014-11-05 13:25:56] dimacus: yeah….
[2014-11-05 13:26:12] dimacus: i know i feel dirty too
[2014-11-05 13:26:49] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-05 13:27:24] jleyba: Might be worth doing
[2014-11-05 13:27:42] dimacus: The other option is to use an applescript
[2014-11-05 13:27:52] dimacus: that clicks on the "Install" button
[2014-11-05 13:28:11] dimacus: and only run it when there is newer version of the driver inside the jar, then currently on the OS
[2014-11-05 13:28:23] dimacus: this is less gross
[2014-11-05 13:28:33] dimacus: in some ways but not the others
[2014-11-05 13:28:53] jleyba: applescript will break a lot
[2014-11-05 13:29:07] dimacus: that it will for sure

[2014-11-05 13:29:28] jimevans: what limitations does the webkit remote debugging protocol have that prevent us from using it to drive safari?
[2014-11-05 13:29:41] jleyba: was a great little script until the UI changed under me. never got it working again
[2014-11-05 13:30:14] dimacus: well i posted some questions to developer portal on apple.com and stack overflow, think i need to walk away for a little bit from it and do something else
[2014-11-05 13:30:59] dimacus: i did notice one thing, that all of the safari DBs and stuff are stored in ~/Library/Safari
[2014-11-05 13:31:16] dimacus: what if each new session gets a /tmp/safari-session-id/*
[2014-11-05 13:31:32] dimacus: would that mean that Safari no longer shares cache, cookies etc between multiple instances?
[2014-11-05 13:31:57] jleyba: dimacus: depends.  can you make safari use that?
[2014-11-05 13:32:06] jleyba: and what does the OS do when you launch the app?
