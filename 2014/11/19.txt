In other words, do all the bindings version bump at the same time as the selenium-server and how closely associated are the binding and server teams?
[2014-11-19 01:14:46] barancev: losh: java, c#, ruby, python, js
[2014-11-19 01:15:12] losh: barancev: yip, that looks like the list.
[2014-11-19 01:15:14] barancev: listed under "Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings"

[2014-11-19 12:58:17] jimevans: but apparently there's some confusion about using expected conditions in .NET. i can only assume it's from people used to the java language bindings who're making the transition to C#
[2014-11-19 12:58:44] AutomatedTester: javascript is starting to copy a number of things from c#

[2014-11-19 18:45:35] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2014-11-19 18:47:12] StephG71: Ok
[2014-11-19 18:47:13] StephG71: :)
[2014-11-19 18:48:01] StephG71: Well I am working some tutorials for Selenium and I am pretty good with automation\C# as I work in it
[2014-11-19 18:48:20] jules___: I'm trying to call click on a button element. i can find the element succcessfully and call the click method, but it doesn't get clicked
[2014-11-19 18:48:43] jules___: other buttons click just find, so i'm at a loss
[2014-11-19 18:48:47] StephG71: But for some reason...I have tried a simple navigate.ToUrl("www.google.com") and it launches FF
[2014-11-19 18:49:00] StephG71: but never navigates
[2014-11-19 18:49:12] StephG71: I have uninstalled multiple versions
[2014-11-19 18:49:19] StephG71: tried two versions of WebDriver
[2014-11-19 18:49:28] StephG71: it just never navigates
[2014-11-19 18:49:56] StephG71: I am using WebDriver 2.44 in Visual Studio 2012 now
[2014-11-19 18:50:19] StephG71: running with the MS test runner
[2014-11-19 18:50:30] StephG71: used Nuget to get the packages
[2014-11-19 18:50:40] StephG71: so install is dead simple
[2014-11-19 18:51:41] StephG71: there has to be a glaring mistake I am making.....cause I can't find help for this issue
