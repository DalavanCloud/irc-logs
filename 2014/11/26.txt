[2014-11-26 11:42:50] jleyba: but in the end it's just a http client with json payloads
[2014-11-26 11:44:33] killjoy9: gotcha, so selenium is turning my python commands into json payloads, which it sends through a proxy server that has the browser logic?

[2014-11-26 11:48:24] dude-x: killjoy9: killing the browser seems unusual, unless it has trouble starting the browser

[2014-11-26 11:49:13] killjoy9: dude-x can make one, hang on a sec.
[2014-11-26 11:52:10] killjoy9: this happens a lot when I’m using the python REPL, which makes it hard for that workflow (have to reinstantiate the browser, re-get the page, etc.) - http://pastebin.com/ZKJP3Axg
[2014-11-26 11:53:01] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-26 11:55:27] jleyba: killjoy9: so the webdriver api gets translated to a http/json command sent to a server
[2014-11-26 11:55:37] jleyba: the server then translates that into something specific for the browser
[2014-11-26 11:55:47] killjoy9: gotcha
[2014-11-26 11:56:01] killjoy9: so is it a phantomjs issue that i’m seeing, rather than selenium?
[2014-11-26 11:56:05] jleyba: yup
[2014-11-26 11:56:56] killjoy9: are there better options instead of PhantomJS for remote headless stuff?  i need to run a browser to interact w/ js-heavy sites from ec2 servers

[2014-11-26 17:19:57] kandinski: I'm trying to understand how to run a test by injecting it into the page in selenium, using selenium-webdriver
[2014-11-26 17:20:13] kandinski: in webbdriverio it would be something like: console.log(client.executeAsync(inject_test, test_data, test_cb));
[2014-11-26 17:21:06] kandinski: (inject_test is a function that gets run in the browser, with test_data as argument, and test_db is of signature (err, ret))
[2014-11-26 17:21:26] kandinski: but I can't find in the documentation of webdriverjs how to do it: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Understanding_the_API
[2014-11-26 17:27:41] kandinski: the corresponding selenium API is https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/execute_async
[2014-11-26 17:30:01] kandinski: the Java is a JavascriptExecutor
