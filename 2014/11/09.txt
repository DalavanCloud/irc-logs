[2014-11-09 12:46:24] bdonnahue1: while using the driveri have set preference to use a socks proxy. What's interesting is that the proxy will only work if i manually navigate once to ANY url using the firefox instance spawned by the driver
[2014-11-09 12:46:28] bdonnahue1: very odd
[2014-11-09 12:48:35] anglisc: hmm would that not be the driver not being able to replicate that manual action rather than the proxy
