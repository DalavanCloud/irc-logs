[2014-11-27 16:19:58] galileopy: good {morning, afternoon, evening} everybody. I was wondering what is the fastest way to run selenium tests, I am considering using phantomjs or a browser in virtual frame buffer.  I will try both now, but I could really use any suggestions you may have. I'm very new to testing and selenium. Thanks for your time, you have built an amazing tool.
