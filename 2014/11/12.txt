[2014-11-12 07:07:42] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: i dont see how it isnt blatantly obvious that someElement.findElement would only find an element in teh context of 'someElement'
[2014-11-12 07:08:05] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that's the client API. the spec doesn't define the client API.
[2014-11-12 07:08:38] WhereIsMySpoon: oh these are the specs for wire?
[2014-11-12 07:08:45] jimevans: the point is that the HTTP endpoint for element.findElement isn't defined in the spec yet. it's an oversight.

[2014-11-12 07:10:12] epaphus: perhaps by email or to pagerduty
[2014-11-12 07:10:31] WhereIsMySpoon: epaphus: you want the IDE to send you email alerts?
[2014-11-12 07:10:38] jimevans: epaphus: that's going to be way outside the scope of what selenium ide can do.
[2014-11-12 07:10:42] WhereIsMySpoon: yea lol
[2014-11-12 07:10:53] brockfredin, quitting. ()
[2014-11-12 07:11:42] jimevans: the "right" way to handle that would be to export your scripts from selenium ide into a "real" programming language, and use the features of that language to do what you need to do.
[2014-11-12 07:12:02] *jimevans needs coffee, and badly'
[2014-11-12 07:12:11] WhereIsMySpoon: well usually you'd have a CI environment that runs your programmed tests and sends emails when theyre done
[2014-11-12 07:12:45] errant_rider: jimevans: i saw the issue in IE9...
[2014-11-12 07:12:47] brockfredin, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-12 07:12:49] errant_rider: do we no longer support IE9?
[2014-11-12 07:12:53] errant_rider: (about addCookie'ing)
[2014-11-12 07:15:00] brockfredin: jimevans What did you mean by verify vs assert?
[2014-11-12 07:15:56] jimevans: errant_rider: so what's the answer to the question i asked in response? is the server sending a cache-control header?
[2014-11-12 07:16:20] jimevans: brockfredin: i'm going to need more context. i've been out of touch for a few days.
[2014-11-12 07:17:00] epaphus: jimevans, WhereIsMySpoon so if i understand correctly selenium is not meant to run as a monitoring system 24x7x365 and test a group of sites every min to alert on it?
[2014-11-12 07:19:07] jimevans: errant_rider: my current working theory is that there's a bug in IE that causes the IHTMLDocument2::get_mimeType() to throw an error when a cache-control header is sent with the value no-cache. there are edge cases that can cause the IE driver to crash if we don't validate that the page being browsed is an actual HTML page, which is why we check the mime type. IE10 fixes the bug, so setting cookies in IE10+ works fine.

[2014-11-12 09:03:57] tourdedave: Rocky_: It's ideal if you can start with a fresh browser each test run. That way your test starts with a clean slate.
[2014-11-12 09:04:28] Rocky_: yup, webdriver will alwayzz do that
[2014-11-12 09:06:37] Rocky_: but my question is ,is it better to close all the instances of FF browser before webdriver opens the FF instance and execute script in it?
[2014-11-12 09:06:37] tourdedave: Rocky_: It will only do that if you tell it to create and destroy the browser instance before and after each test run.
[2014-11-12 09:07:31] WhereIsMySpoon: Rocky_: ideally you should call driver.quit in your tearDown test method (if you're using a test framework)

[2014-11-12 11:23:41] dimacus: it's a minor issue, just curiousity though
[2014-11-12 11:24:11] barancev: dimacus: ctrl-break to dump the stack
[2014-11-12 11:24:16] jimevans: dimacus: quick and dirty way to test, turn UAC off, and try it.
[2014-11-12 11:24:56] jimevans: if you really think it's UAC.
[2014-11-12 11:25:31] jimevans: or run from an elevated command prompt. that'd do it too.
[2014-11-12 11:26:42] dimacus: ahhh good point
[2014-11-12 11:26:50] dimacus: i'll turn of UAC and see what happens
[2014-11-12 11:27:57] dimacus: good news though, all the local changes seem to work on Windows Safari and pre 10.10 safari… two more changes and the "unable to establish a connection with the SafariDriver extension" defects can be closed!

[2014-11-12 11:29:46] dimacus: that's why i'm testing on windows damn it… refactoring means no new features
[2014-11-12 11:30:25] dimacus: although i've worked with a team lead who kept on saying "It's ok to add new sweeping features to the code base while refactoring, as long as the public interface does not change"
[2014-11-12 11:30:57] dimacus: he also had 5 layers of self imposed abstraction from hibernate to core of the code

[2014-11-12 12:13:39] sevaseva: simonstewart: My understanding is that really only 'atoms atoms' need to be rolled back. other javascript code doesn;t bloat anything.
[2014-11-12 12:13:41] jleyba: AutomatedTester: see link above, screenshot half way down under the "Cloud" header
[2014-11-12 12:13:55] AutomatedTester: *facepalm*
[2014-11-12 12:13:57] barancev: when we repack 3rd party jars to selenium-server-standalone we include all
[2014-11-12 12:14:15] sevaseva: simonstewart: and I have a change that will add the license header to every atom *once* (not one per source file)
[2014-11-12 12:15:31] sevaseva: simonstewart: jleyba, is having @license headers in non-atoms javascript also problematic?
[2014-11-12 12:19:23] simonstewart: sevaseva: it'll bloat the normal compiled code, even if it's just string concatenation
[2014-11-12 12:19:31] simonstewart: It's just less noticable there
[2014-11-12 12:23:12] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 774
[2014-11-12 12:27:31] sevaseva: simonstewart: It will. It is not very clear to me why that is a problem in anywhere but atoms. (But I can live with that) Also, I *think* that licenses *require* that final artifacts include the license header. In atoms I'll make that happen by submitting a crazyfun change (as jleyba suggested). Elsewhere - and there we have code published under several different licenses - letting the compiler bloat the code looks like
[2014-11-12 12:27:31] sevaseva:  a good solution to me

[2014-11-12 12:28:24] simonstewart: Everything we ship is under the Apache 2 license
[2014-11-12 12:28:40] simonstewart: I think there's probably a requirement to distribute a copy of the license
[2014-11-12 12:28:45] simonstewart: But it doesn't need to be compiled into the code
[2014-11-12 12:28:55] simonstewart: and it's debatable whether it's even needed for source files at all
[2014-11-12 12:31:15] mtscout6_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-12 12:31:27] sevaseva: Some lawyers told me that in case of javascript, specifically, it does need to be part of the code (probably because any valid js file is 'executable' by itself.. or something).
[2014-11-12 12:31:36] sevaseva: And of course any license that portions of the code are published under need to be included.
[2014-11-12 12:31:50] sevaseva: that said, I don;t to be making that my personal problem :)
[2014-11-12 12:32:26] simonstewart: I'm still sceptical
[2014-11-12 12:32:42] simonstewart: But if that is true, the compiler should identify identical license headers and collapse them
[2014-11-12 12:33:35] sevaseva: that sounds like a good feature request for the compiler, I agree
[2014-11-12 12:34:01] simonstewart: Pribably one that has more weight from a Googler....
[2014-11-12 12:34:15] jleyba: I think this is a matter of distribution. We can modify the code as we see fit (e.g. "compile" it)

[2014-11-12 12:35:17] jleyba: are we "distributing" the compiled atoms when they are included in the jar, to be used internally by the jar?

[2014-11-12 12:35:38] simonstewart: Nope
[2014-11-12 12:35:52] simonstewart: They're not usable to the end user like that
[2014-11-12 12:36:00] simonstewart: And they'd need to jump through hoops to extract them
[2014-11-12 12:36:19] simonstewart: There's probably some DMCA shit that means you can't just unpack the jar
[2014-11-12 12:36:54] jleyba: simonstewart: reasonably speaking, no. but lawyers aren't reasonable and could probably argue a jar counts as copyright protection

[2014-11-12 12:38:08] lukeis: the legal system… certainly
[2014-11-12 12:38:43] simonstewart: I've had more to do with the legal system recently than I'd care for.
[2014-11-12 12:42:26] sevaseva: let me annoy you with the atoms for another second :) yes, including license headers definitely has to do with distribution. I don't know all the ways atoms and other selenium js code is distributed (and lawyers' argument is that as things change, no one knows that precisely at any given moment of time, so it's wise to have layers or protection)
[2014-11-12 12:42:34] sevaseva: One practical question:
[2014-11-12 12:42:53] lampd1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-12 12:43:10] sevaseva: Do you want me to land a change that adds the license header (once) to every atom output file ?
[2014-11-12 12:43:51] sevaseva: a crazyfun change, not in js sourse files

[2014-11-12 12:44:12] lukeis: simonstewart: btw, we do 'distribute' the compiled atoms (selendroid, ios-driver, appium)

[2014-11-12 12:44:33] simonstewart: I don't really want the atoms being bloated _at all_

[2014-11-12 12:44:49] simonstewart: I don't really understand why the situation has changed
[2014-11-12 12:45:00] simonstewart: Particularly since jleyba and I did this work years ago
[2014-11-12 12:45:01] sevaseva: lawyers noticed :)
[2014-11-12 12:45:07] lukeis: a lawyer decided to look at something? ;)

[2014-11-12 12:49:42] simonstewart: sevaseva: what did they _actually_ ask for?

[2014-11-12 12:51:14] sevaseva: . /**@license */  is a requirement in 3rd party js files, internally. so that if the files are Ever compiled, that's not stripped. they asked for that.

[2014-11-12 12:53:01] sevaseva: right. and I will. I just suspect that SFC lawyers would agree with google's :)

[2014-11-12 12:53:36] sevaseva: and really I don't see how that can hit us if we comply
[2014-11-12 12:54:42] simonstewart: sevaseva: the performance of the atoms, and the size of various libraries, is impacted by including the license (since there's more text to parse, if nothing else)
[2014-11-12 12:55:13] simonstewart: Worse, that license is identical in all cases, except for the year
[2014-11-12 12:55:35] simonstewart: So we introduce a shocking amount of bloat, impact performance and get no net benefit from including it
[2014-11-12 12:55:48] simonstewart: Other than making some lawyer about a point that may or may not be valid
[2014-11-12 12:57:39] simonstewart: For example: when we compile the atoms down to a header, do we need to include the license in the strings? At the top of the header file?
[2014-11-12 12:57:40] sevaseva: It's your call. "identical in all cases, except for the year" is very untrue (although it could be "mostly true"), but that doesn't change your point.
[2014-11-12 12:57:54] simonstewart: It should be true if it's not

[2014-11-12 12:59:12] simonstewart: In the webdriver atoms?
[2014-11-12 12:59:41] sevaseva: atoms atoms are all apache2. some other selenium js code has a few funky licenses
[2014-11-12 12:59:58] simonstewart: That'll be less of a problem soon
[2014-11-12 13:00:09] sevaseva: "soon" :)
[2014-11-12 13:00:21] simonstewart: The selenium core code is all ours.
[2014-11-12 13:00:25] simonstewart: wgxpath is apache 2 too
[2014-11-12 13:00:37] simonstewart: there's some code from mootools or something similar
[2014-11-12 13:01:27] simonstewart: Which is properly ancient, but I'd need to check the license there
[2014-11-12 13:02:18] simonstewart: So the webdriver code should be clean
[2014-11-12 13:02:32] simonstewart: And the core stuff is ancient and will soon be obsoleted
[2014-11-12 13:02:49] simonstewart: We've gone 10 years without grief
[2014-11-12 13:03:22] simonstewart: And multiple legal reviews

[2014-11-12 13:07:17] sevaseva: ok. so I won't push any license commits, will just fix stuff internally. it's just slightly more work for me. and I see your point about leaving alone stuff that hasn't been a problem.

[2014-11-12 13:23:31] jleyba: simonstewart: not on that team anymore and not privy to the actual conversation, but I'd wager they want license annotations internally and Seva pushed the change upstream since we've so far kept the atoms perfectly in sync
[2014-11-12 13:23:42] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-12 13:23:42] simonstewart: Ah
[2014-11-12 13:24:00] juangj: yeah, i think it was basically just simpler to push it upstream
[2014-11-12 13:24:02] simonstewart: There I was hoping that the google lawyers were going to start looking out for _every_ OSS project's code
[2014-11-12 13:24:15] simonstewart: I hear MS are new at this.... :)
[2014-11-12 13:24:33] juangj: it's doable to leave the license stuff in google3 and just strip it, it's just a modest amount more work
[2014-11-12 13:25:11] simonstewart: Interesting
[2014-11-12 13:25:26] simonstewart: Aren't the atoms somewhere under third party?
[2014-11-12 13:25:30] sevaseva: simonstewart: lawyers don't want to alter any licenses, they want them to be included everywhere as is. all thirdparty code.
[2014-11-12 13:25:30] juangj: and it seemed like it would maybe, possibly be valuable upstream as well (at least, absent the significant bloat)
[2014-11-12 13:25:46] sevaseva: of course atoms are thirdparty
[2014-11-12 13:25:53] simonstewart: sevaseva: I think the lawyers misunderstand the meaning of "third party"

[2014-11-12 14:24:52] RajatJindal: i did added a timeout to futuretask, and its getting timedout as expected. however it looks like it is still stuck because the http request that this task started is still stuck

[2014-11-12 14:27:38] jleyba: RajatJindal: reading your bug, want to make sure I understand the problem
[2014-11-12 14:27:50] jleyba: (1) client sends request to selenium-server-standalone
[2014-11-12 14:28:15] RajatJindal: yeah
[2014-11-12 14:28:16] jleyba: (2) selenium-server-standalone sends request to chromedriver (or some other node)
[2014-11-12 14:28:23] jleyba: (2) hangs
[2014-11-12 14:28:34] RajatJindal: yes
[2014-11-12 14:28:46] barancev: what exactly hangs?
[2014-11-12 14:28:57] jleyba: (3) send another request to selenium-server-standalone for that session; this is never sent to chromedriver
[2014-11-12 14:28:58] RajatJindal: (1) timeouts after http timeout
[2014-11-12 14:29:07] RajatJindal: yes that is right

[2014-11-12 14:29:23] barancev: if there is a deadlock in the server -- let's fix it on the server
[2014-11-12 14:29:25] RajatJindal: but if you try sending (3) directly to chromedriver it responds
[2014-11-12 14:29:37] barancev: instead of retrying requests from a client
[2014-11-12 14:29:52] Syndlig: Hello!
[2014-11-12 14:30:31] RajatJindal: barancev: we are not retrying, we are trying to execute next command now
[2014-11-12 14:30:43] barancev: RajatJindal: tune timeouts so that server timeout is less then http timeout
[2014-11-12 14:30:58] Syndlig: Question: Is it possible to make a plugin of some sort for Selenium IDE to export into Gosu?
[2014-11-12 14:30:58] barancev: to obtain a proper "timeout response" from the server
[2014-11-12 14:31:13] Syndlig: Or have tests written in Gosu that convert to Selenium 2?
[2014-11-12 14:31:42] barancev: what is Gosu? :)
[2014-11-12 14:31:47] barancev: I'm a noob...
[2014-11-12 14:31:59] Syndlig: Trust me I'm not exactly any better off than you :P
[2014-11-12 14:32:12] RajatJindal: thats the fix i did. i added a timeout to selenium-server to chrome driver command by adding a timeout to futuretask
[2014-11-12 14:32:38] Syndlig: Gosu is a programming language used for Guidewire. Basically insurance stuff.
[2014-11-12 14:32:45] barancev: aha, http://gosu-lang.github.io/
[2014-11-12 14:33:02] RajatJindal: but the underlying http request looks like is still holding streams, and thus not allowing executor to execute next future task
[2014-11-12 14:33:24] barancev: RajatJindal: because it does holding
[2014-11-12 14:33:44] barancev: the request is incomplete
[2014-11-12 14:33:52] jleyba: I don't think timing out the task does anything other than timing out the task instance
[2014-11-12 14:33:53] barancev: you can't fix this on the client side
[2014-11-12 14:34:08] jleyba: you need to propagate that down to the HTTP client that made the request to the chromedriver and cancel the request
[2014-11-12 14:34:19] RajatJindal: yeah, and we need to be able to say don't hold after timeout
[2014-11-12 14:34:42] RajatJindal: yeah thats the next step i was thinking.
[2014-11-12 14:34:51] barancev: server should be able to do this
[2014-11-12 14:35:06] barancev: if you set browser timeout

[2014-11-12 14:35:28] RajatJindal: if you can take a look at the change i suggested, and let me know if atleast i am moving in right direction.
[2014-11-12 14:36:12] jleyba: Syndling: if Gosu runs on the JVM, it should be able to invoke Java, no?
[2014-11-12 14:36:14] barancev: -browserTimeout should do the trick, no?
[2014-11-12 14:37:39] Syndlig: jleyba: It can indeed!
[2014-11-12 14:37:45] Syndlig: And that basically solves my problem, didn't even think about that :P
[2014-11-12 14:37:59] barancev: RajatJindal: it is not a right direction imho, if you have a hanging request on the server you need to cancel it somehow
[2014-11-12 14:38:36] Syndlig: Thanks guys, and with that I'm gone. o7

[2014-11-12 14:39:28] jleyba: barancev: this is going to propagate throughout the stack
[2014-11-12 14:39:29] RajatJindal: yeah, so what i am trying to do here is set timeout before making request to browser
[2014-11-12 14:39:55] jleyba: in HttpCommandExecutor we'll probably need to catch thread interrupts and cancel the request from there
[2014-11-12 14:40:27] barancev: RajatJindal: it is dangerous to send another request while the previous one is incomplete
[2014-11-12 14:40:44] barancev: drivers are "single-threaded"
[2014-11-12 14:40:50] RajatJindal: so client set remote_timeout for both futuretask [already part of patch that i added to bug] and underlying http request [chrome driver or firefox driver]
[2014-11-12 14:40:55] jleyba: barancev, RajatJindal: behavior for concurrent requests is explicitly undefined
[2014-11-12 14:41:34] RajatJindal: yeah, it won't be concurrent, but we would know on client side that after 'x' seconds, the request will get timeout automatically
[2014-11-12 14:41:41] barancev: barancev: we don't have a feature to cancel a request by a client
[2014-11-12 14:41:52] barancev: jleyba: ^^^
[2014-11-12 14:42:05] jleyba: barancev: right
[2014-11-12 14:42:06] RajatJindal: so that client can send next request after 'x' seconds and not send it before 'x' seconds if no response received

[2014-11-12 14:44:24] RajatJindal: barancev: i meant the server will send timeout response to client, before client sends next request
[2014-11-12 14:44:40] barancev: how to cancel a request sent to chromedriver (for example)?
[2014-11-12 14:44:57] barancev: RajatJindal: this is already implemented
[2014-11-12 14:45:38] RajatJindal: yeah, but currently timeout does not happen due to blocking call from server to remote server
[2014-11-12 14:45:47] jleyba: barancev: ignore everything about the timeout
[2014-11-12 14:45:59] RajatJindal: we need a way to configure timeout for that blocking request
[2014-11-12 14:46:06] jleyba: for java, what's the "right" thing for HttpCommandExecutor to do when there is a thread interrupt?

[2014-11-12 14:51:28] barancev: so it should fly out of HttpCommandExecutor
[2014-11-12 14:51:48] jleyba: Yeah, looks like apache http client already handles the interrupt
[2014-11-12 14:52:14] RajatJindal: InterruptedException is for the sleep we are doing only when there is a BindException

[2014-11-12 14:57:23] jleyba: when that times out, it doesn't cancel the task, just the wait for it to complete
[2014-11-12 14:58:36] RajatJindal: yeah. i found that a little later, and made that modification on my end

[2014-11-12 15:01:17] jleyba: barancev: when you cancel the task, that should interrupt the task's thread
[2014-11-12 15:01:30] RajatJindal: for that we need to propagate this timeout to the underlying http request
[2014-11-12 15:01:35] jleyba: which should cause http client to abort the request
[2014-11-12 15:01:55] barancev: jleyba: what does this mean for the server?
[2014-11-12 15:02:18] jleyba: the selenium-standalone-server?
[2014-11-12 15:02:37] jleyba: the session should become available again
[2014-11-12 15:02:38] barancev: yes, for the selenium server, that is waiting a response from (e.g) chromedriver
[2014-11-12 15:03:36] barancev: the session is available, it can accept the next command, but it can't execute it on the browser
[2014-11-12 15:03:53] jleyba: that depends on the remote node
[2014-11-12 15:04:04] jleyba: what it does if the connection is closed early
[2014-11-12 15:04:14] barancev: no idea :)
[2014-11-12 15:04:29] jleyba: I'm not saying we should expose a configurable timeout...this has just piqued my interest
[2014-11-12 15:05:08] RajatJindal: barancev: i think the remote node is available for serving more requests, but its not getting any more due to session on selenium-standalone not available for more requests

[2014-11-12 15:05:32] jleyba: have you attached a debugger?
[2014-11-12 15:05:44] jleyba: see how far the server gets when a new request comes in
[2014-11-12 15:05:44] barancev: but no idea what "request aborted" means for HTTP
[2014-11-12 15:05:50] barancev: that is stateless
[2014-11-12 15:05:54] jleyba: aborted == connection closed
[2014-11-12 15:06:04] barancev: that means nothing
[2014-11-12 15:06:24] barancev: a client is allowed to close connection at any time
[2014-11-12 15:06:42] barancev: may be after each request
[2014-11-12 15:06:43] jleyba: yes, and the server is free to handle that as it sees fit
[2014-11-12 15:07:05] barancev: the server can't demand a client to keep connection open
[2014-11-12 15:07:07] jleyba: i've seen servers that process a request, go to write a response, see the connection is gone, and just drop it

[2014-11-12 15:07:49] barancev: but I got the idea
[2014-11-12 15:07:52] jleyba: it's a question of whether the server handles it gracefully if the connection closes before a response is written
[2014-11-12 15:08:13] barancev: and I don't want to dig jetty code, tbh :)
[2014-11-12 15:08:19] jleyba: no one does

[2014-11-12 15:13:55] jleyba: RajatJindal: I'm curious what your tests are doing to trigger this
[2014-11-12 15:13:57] jleyba: I've never seen it before
[2014-11-12 15:14:25] RajatJindal: our tests open a popup, we make some changes there, and wait for popup to close
[2014-11-12 15:14:33] RajatJindal: if popup is still open, we check for any error msg
[2014-11-12 15:14:35] jleyba: as barnacev said, please include an executable reproducible test case :)
[2014-11-12 15:14:59] RajatJindal: yeah sure. i will try to provide a more crisp reproducible scenario

[2014-11-12 15:18:30] RajatJindal: so i don't think this is a scaling issue
