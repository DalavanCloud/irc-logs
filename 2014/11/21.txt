[2014-11-21 06:05:41] barancev: AutomatedTester: ato: regarding "flash" and Firefox crashes on plugin-container -- I've reproduced the issue in C# binding

[2014-11-21 10:10:34] pivA: I need to install the Firefox driver MANUALLY on some Jenkins slaves that are provisioned using Docker, how should I do that? I've extracted the .xpi from the server JAR but can't find a single place in the internet stating how to install this .xpi in Firefox without manual steps, I need to do this programatically when creating the container
[2014-11-21 10:10:58] jleyba: don't
[2014-11-21 10:11:08] jleyba: Selenium installs it when you create a FirefoxDriver instance
[2014-11-21 10:12:10] pivA: O
[2014-11-21 10:12:18] pivA: I'm using selenium via Watir
[2014-11-21 10:12:23] pivA: it'll not install the Firefox driver
[2014-11-21 10:12:36] jimevans: pivA: it should.
[2014-11-21 10:12:38] pivA: that's my problem, these tests run with Watir in Ruby
[2014-11-21 10:13:02] jleyba: jarib: around?  ^
[2014-11-21 10:13:06] pivA: but it isn't and never have installed, it'll timeout every single time waiting for the driver to come online :/
[2014-11-21 10:13:59] jimevans: ah, that may be a different issue. does it launch firefox?
[2014-11-21 10:14:08] Titus: Watir uses Firefox just fine without driver issues: browser = Watir::Browser.new :firefox

[2014-11-21 10:14:33] pivA: jimevans: yeap, it's launching firefox (at least the process is running)
[2014-11-21 10:15:07] jimevans: then it's likely an issue between the version of firefox and the version of the ruby bindings that your watir installation is using.
[2014-11-21 10:15:13] pivA: Titus: it's spitting this type of log when trying to run our tests: Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError: unable to obtain stable firefox connection in 60 seconds (127.0.0.1:7055)
[2014-11-21 10:15:29] jleyba: pivA: anything interesting showing up in Firefox's error console?
[2014-11-21 10:15:32] jimevans: and the browser developer console would likely have a lot of information that would prove/disprove that
[2014-11-21 10:15:39] jimevans: s/developer/error/
[2014-11-21 10:15:41] pivA: jimevans: I'll check that but it runs fine on every dev machine, only in these workers I'm having trouble
[2014-11-21 10:15:52] jleyba: jimevans: I think they're the same these days.
[2014-11-21 10:15:54] pivA: I can't access the console, etc, it's running headless in my servers
[2014-11-21 10:16:06] pivA: our servers* :P
[2014-11-21 10:16:07] jimevans: of *course* it is.
[2014-11-21 10:16:31] jimevans: because headless browsers are *so* easy to debug when you run into issues like this.
[2014-11-21 10:17:17] Titus: I've seen that error recently. Verify your watir-webdriver and your firefox versions are up to date.
[2014-11-21 10:17:23] jimevans: i'm reasonably certain that it's a mismatch in versions, but i don't have any magic bullet for finding that.
[2014-11-21 10:17:30] jleyba: does ruby swallow firefox's stdout/err output?
[2014-11-21 10:17:41] pivA: yeah, it's a real PITA and we have a really fine setup using Chrome already, we've ran into an issue where Paypal's sandbox has a major fuckup in their markup that is currently crashing our chromedriver
[2014-11-21 10:18:29] pivA: Titus: will check it, they probably are because our Gemfile doesn't do version fixing but I'll give a shot at that
[2014-11-21 10:18:42] pivA: thanks all of you for the prompt response :D

[2014-11-21 12:39:45] mtscout6: Yes, Served 6 years in the US Marine Corps Infantry
[2014-11-21 12:40:09] AutomatedTester: impressive
[2014-11-21 12:40:26] mtscout6: I got a lot of flak for being a smart gurnt
[2014-11-21 12:40:37] AutomatedTester: isnt that always the way?
[2014-11-21 12:40:37] mtscout6: grunt* that can't spell
[2014-11-21 12:40:46] lukeis: heh :)
[2014-11-21 12:40:56] AutomatedTester: mtscout6: what did you do?
[2014-11-21 12:42:03] ddary, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2014-11-21 12:43:02] mtscout6: I was in Iraq in 2009, I did company level intelligence for my infantry company. I did sensitive site exploitation of weapons caches, and terrorist cell analysis.
[2014-11-21 12:43:18] AutomatedTester: awesome
[2014-11-21 12:43:27] sircapsalot: what do you think about all the stuff that's going on here at home?
[2014-11-21 12:43:35] AutomatedTester: what was your final rank?
[2014-11-21 12:44:38] mtscout6: I left as a Sergaent
[2014-11-21 12:45:13] jimevans: E-5?
[2014-11-21 12:45:17] mtscout6: correct
[2014-11-21 12:45:24] sircapsalot: avoiding my question? :(
[2014-11-21 12:45:34] AutomatedTester: sircapsalot: it's kinda loaded
[2014-11-21 12:46:00] sircapsalot: true.. lotta crap happening.  too much to comment on i suppose.
[2014-11-21 12:46:03] mtscout6: No, thinking how to respond. I don't feel this is the proper forum for that kind of question.
[2014-11-21 12:46:09] Ardesco, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-21 12:46:33] sircapsalot: it's sort of a free-talk forum from what i understand.  i've been regularing this irc for years.  all kindsa stuff gets brought up :)
[2014-11-21 12:46:41] sircapsalot: fun discussions
[2014-11-21 12:46:46] sircapsalot: and selenium talk.
[2014-11-21 12:47:04] jimevans: mtscout6: ah, we're a social bunch. not everything has to be technical. you should see it when AutomatedTester and errant_rider get into it sometimes. :)
[2014-11-21 12:47:19] jimevans: or at least used to.
[2014-11-21 12:47:23] lukeis: let's talk about gun control shall we? :-P
[2014-11-21 12:47:33] jimevans: we haven't had a good gun debate for awhile. :)
[2014-11-21 12:47:48] mtscout6: Understandable, but still a loaded question
[2014-11-21 12:47:49] sircapsalot: aka people control :)
[2014-11-21 12:48:03] *jimevans gets popcorn'
[2014-11-21 12:48:18] AutomatedTester: I have upset people enough this week talking about war zones and kids under 10...
[2014-11-21 12:48:21] lukeis: there's few people i trust to hold a weaponâ€¦ of those, most are ex military :)
[2014-11-21 12:48:52] sircapsalot: can't even trust cops.. despite their awesome service to their communities, too many innocent people get killed by them even
[2014-11-21 12:48:56] sircapsalot: sad but true
[2014-11-21 12:49:02] mtscout6: lukeis: you didn't serve with some of the same people I did
[2014-11-21 12:49:18] lukeis: heh
[2014-11-21 12:49:20] *jleyba knows some ex military that shouldn't be allowed to touch a weapon of any kind'
[2014-11-21 12:49:33] jleyba: (sadly things didn't go well for them)
[2014-11-21 12:49:42] lukeis: note i said few :)
[2014-11-21 12:50:03] *AutomatedTester disappears to do some admin tasks before a meeting'
[2014-11-21 12:50:05] sircapsalot: all i know is, if somebody wants to hurt my me, my kids, or my wife.. they're getting a surpriseâ€¦ it's sick that peope want to take away my means of protection
[2014-11-21 12:50:27] lukeis: it's sick to think that a gun will actually protect you :)
[2014-11-21 12:50:40] *lukeis tries to now run away from the debate'
[2014-11-21 12:50:48] mtscout6: A gun is only as good as the trained individual behind it
[2014-11-21 12:50:51] *sircapsalot cracks knuckles'
[2014-11-21 12:51:12] sircapsalot: exactly mtscout6.  i'm trained in the use of my firearm.  never had to use it, and i hope i never have to.
[2014-11-21 12:52:01] sircapsalot: "better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it"  i'm sure from a military perspective, you could empathize with that one
[2014-11-21 12:52:32] mtscout6: sure can
[2014-11-21 12:53:12] lukeis: problem i see with that is most civilians who are untrained will assume they are in a situation that needs it, when they actually are not :(
[2014-11-21 12:53:15] sircapsalot: so lukeis, why does a cop carry a weapon?  :)   protection.  why does a gun owner carry a weapon?  :)  protection
[2014-11-21 12:54:06] errant_rider: jimevans: is it time to start talking guns and politics in here?
[2014-11-21 12:54:19] errant_rider: waitâ€¦who started the gun debate?  it wasn't me this time!
[2014-11-21 12:54:20] lukeis: dammitâ€¦ who let leo back in here ;)

[2014-11-21 12:54:50] lukeis: note, leo is not a LEO
[2014-11-21 12:54:52] errant_rider: i ahte guns
[2014-11-21 12:55:00] errant_rider: i think they should be banned from the general populace
[2014-11-21 12:55:07] sircapsalot: and only police and military should have them"
[2014-11-21 12:55:08] sircapsalot: ?
[2014-11-21 12:55:12] sircapsalot: sounds a lot like the SS
[2014-11-21 12:55:16] errant_rider: ever since I went into that classroom, said "i am the only one in this room authorized to use a gun" and shot myself in the balls
[2014-11-21 12:55:33] errant_rider: then I sued the ATF for ridiculing me
[2014-11-21 12:55:40] errant_rider: :)
[2014-11-21 12:55:42] sircapsalot: you're referring to the ATF agent that shot himself in the foot?
[2014-11-21 12:55:51] errant_rider: in the leg actually
[2014-11-21 12:55:52] sircapsalot: idiot.. that's straight negligence
[2014-11-21 12:55:55] sircapsalot: right
[2014-11-21 12:56:03] errant_rider: i'm very progun
[2014-11-21 12:56:08] errant_rider: AutomatedTesterâ€¦is british

[2014-11-21 12:56:45] errant_rider: and i'm just taking the piss now:)
[2014-11-21 12:56:46] lukeis: it's subtle...
[2014-11-21 12:56:49] AutomatedTester: *facepalm*
[2014-11-21 12:56:57] errant_rider: :)
[2014-11-21 12:57:02] errant_rider: AutomatedTester: you love guns right?
[2014-11-21 12:57:07] errant_rider: i keep forgetting where you stand on this issue
[2014-11-21 12:57:12] lukeis: heh
[2014-11-21 12:57:16] errant_rider: (snort)
[2014-11-21 12:57:19] errant_rider: </troll>
[2014-11-21 12:57:30] AutomatedTester: I dont have an issue with guns as long as they are in the hands properly trained people
[2014-11-21 12:57:52] sircapsalot: that's right.  i'm not going to hurt you, as long as yo udont hurt me.. that's my philosophy
[2014-11-21 12:57:55] errant_rider: so can anyone in the populace who is not military or police be "properly trained"
[2014-11-21 12:57:59] AutomatedTester: but the US has shown regularly that they lack the properly trained people
[2014-11-21 12:57:59] sircapsalot: if you're intentions are to physically harm me, we might not get along
[2014-11-21 12:58:07] errant_rider: what level of training do you need to be "proper"?
[2014-11-21 12:58:39] jleyba: active military?
[2014-11-21 12:59:11] errant_rider: hah you should go see a military marksmanship course
[2014-11-21 12:59:12] errant_rider: its hilarious
[2014-11-21 12:59:20] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I am happy with active military/ specially trained gun police (like SWAT)
[2014-11-21 12:59:31] sircapsalot: even police, they only shoot as much as they're required in the academy
[2014-11-21 12:59:39] jleyba: AutomatedTester: give it a year or two and all police will look like swat :(
[2014-11-21 12:59:42] sircapsalot: they miss all the time and cause collateral damage
[2014-11-21 12:59:46] errant_rider: jleyba they already do...
[2014-11-21 12:59:53] jnott: sircapsalot, like acceptance tests
[2014-11-21 13:00:03] AutomatedTester: jleyba: looks like a duck, quacks like a dodo though
[2014-11-21 13:00:06] sircapsalot: that's right.
[2014-11-21 13:00:15] errant_rider: i know of an incident where police shot hundreds of bullets into a stationary object with a man inside of itâ€¦and barely hit the man.  Didn't kill him.  And he dseerved killing.  REALLY Deserved killing
[2014-11-21 13:00:22] errant_rider: :trained: police
[2014-11-21 13:00:48] AutomatedTester: deserved killing? Ok... I am done with this conversation
