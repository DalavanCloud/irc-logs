[2014-11-17 08:15:34] dimacus: gonna look at it this week
[2014-11-17 08:16:23] smccarthy: I keep meaning to look into that enhancement for Appium nodes : https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras/issues/57 .  Maybe this week also
[2014-11-17 08:18:01] smccarthy: Also, I dont think https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras/issues/70 is really a bug. It seems like the person is locked down in their system, so they cant even change the Mixed Content Mode manually (from what I can tell)
[2014-11-17 08:19:17] jimevans: hey dimacus, plugged your book on the podcast this week. :)

[2014-11-17 08:23:24] scf: jimevans: hi!
[2014-11-17 08:23:35] jimevans: scf: hello!
[2014-11-17 08:23:55] scf: jimevans: I have to bother you with one question :)
[2014-11-17 08:24:20] jimevans: s'up?
[2014-11-17 08:24:38] scf: jimevans: do you know exactly how capturing screenshot works in IE?
[2014-11-17 08:25:03] jimevans: i do.
[2014-11-17 08:25:07] jimevans: intimately
[2014-11-17 08:25:22] scf: I discovered that for example when window is maximized - capture does restoring window size first
[2014-11-17 08:25:23] scf: haha
[2014-11-17 08:25:28] jimevans: yep.
[2014-11-17 08:25:30] jimevans: by design.
[2014-11-17 08:25:55] scf: this is not worst thing
[2014-11-17 08:26:21] scf: another one is: when page content has scrolling capture does something with window too
[2014-11-17 08:26:27] scf: resizes it or something
[2014-11-17 08:26:40] jimevans: yep. by design./
[2014-11-17 08:26:58] scf: by design of IE or driver?
[2014-11-17 08:27:10] jimevans: by design of the screenshot api.
[2014-11-17 08:27:25] jimevans: the webdriver screenshot api means "take a full-dom screenshot"
[2014-11-17 08:27:54] jimevans: the only way to get one of those in IE is to resize the window so that the full dom can be drawn without scrolling. hence the window resize.
[2014-11-17 08:28:05] scf: I see
[2014-11-17 08:28:22] jimevans: firefox doesn't have this problem because it can use an offscreen canvas to rerender the dom into and take the screenshot from that.
[2014-11-17 08:28:24] scf: what will happen when content size is bigger than screen?
[2014-11-17 08:28:41] jimevans: chrome doesn't support full-dom screenshots, and there are bugs against chromedriver for this.
[2014-11-17 08:29:10] jimevans: if the content size is bigger than the screen, the window is resized big enough to render the full page (up to 64k pixels in either direction)(
[2014-11-17 08:29:30] scf: wow cool
[2014-11-17 08:29:53] jimevans: of course, there's an outstanding issue if you use the 32-bit IE driver with IE10 or 11.
[2014-11-17 08:30:04] jimevans: on a 64-bit version of windows.
[2014-11-17 08:30:21] scf: what is it?
[2014-11-17 08:30:33] jimevans: you'll get a rendering of whatever's visible on the screen, but the remainder of the document will be black.
[2014-11-17 08:31:12] scf: nice
[2014-11-17 08:31:13] jimevans: this blog post details why. http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2014/09/screenshots-sendkeys-and-sixty-four.html

[2014-11-17 08:32:10] scf: the problem with this resizing stuff is that it breaks tests :)

[2014-11-17 08:32:39] scf: I try to screenshot a hovered button and of course it fails
[2014-11-17 08:32:40] bitgeeky, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-17 08:33:04] jimevans: well that sounds suboptima.
[2014-11-17 08:33:08] jimevans: suboptimal even
[2014-11-17 08:33:52] jimevans: if you can think of a way around it that still allows a full-dom screenshot, i'm open to exploring it. but realize that disabling the window resize, even behind a capability is a nonstarter.
[2014-11-17 08:34:07] jimevans: in your case i'd use a non-selenium screenshot library.
[2014-11-17 08:34:19] jimevans: or just call the Windows PrintWindow API directly.
[2014-11-17 08:34:51] scf: but we run test machines in selenium grid
[2014-11-17 08:35:08] jimevans: oh, and i dispute the assertion that the behavior "breaks tests". you can't break something that never worked.
[2014-11-17 08:35:09] jimevans: :)
[2014-11-17 08:35:16] scf: haha
[2014-11-17 08:35:45] jimevans: it's unfortunate that the driver behaves that way, but there's no other way to make it work.
[2014-11-17 08:35:52] scf: jimevans: will setWindowSize make IE resize to bigger than scren dimensions?
[2014-11-17 08:36:28] jimevans: no, it won't.
[2014-11-17 08:36:36] scf: damn

[2014-11-17 08:37:04] Naughton, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-11-17 08:37:14] jimevans: the only reason that the driver is able to do so is that we create a windows hook procedure that allows us to trick IE into thinking it can size itself bigger than the Windows OS really will let us.
[2014-11-17 08:37:26] scf: yeah I read that
[2014-11-17 08:37:42] jimevans: and that's the only way i know of to do it.
[2014-11-17 08:38:12] scf: could setWindowSize utilize same trick?
[2014-11-17 08:38:54] eric__, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-17 08:38:56] jimevans: probably not. it would require a C dll, and use of the windows SetWindowHook API.
[2014-11-17 08:39:38] jimevans: or more correctly, it probably could do so, but it would be exceedingly difficult to code and maintain.
[2014-11-17 08:40:06] scf: ok, I thought it's not that complex
[2014-11-17 08:40:10] jimevans: and i doubt the javascript api would be able to take advantage of it, since i don't think it can use native os APIs
[2014-11-17 08:41:23] jimevans: the code isn't that complex, but it does require a native code calling facility (ctypes in python, jni in java, p/invoke in .NET, etc.), which makes it complicated for most people writing in those languages.
[2014-11-17 08:42:06] jimevans: and there's the added problem of if you don't code your dll properly, a crash can take down your entire language runtime.
[2014-11-17 08:42:14] jimevans: like crashing the jvm
[2014-11-17 08:42:45] scf: I thought every wd command goes through ie driver, no?
[2014-11-17 08:43:25] jimevans: ah. i see what you're getting at now. i misunderstood.
[2014-11-17 08:43:54] jimevans: in theory it *could*, but for IE10 and IE11, it'll fail miserably when using the 32-bit driver.
[2014-11-17 08:44:03] jimevans: for the reasons outlined in the blog post.
[2014-11-17 08:44:13] eric__: Hello, I have a WebDriverBackedSelenium object that is using a RemoteWebDriver. The base URL of this is `www.example.com/something` which is a redirect to `www.example.com/something/`. will the `selenium.waitForPageToLoad("3000")` method follow redirects by default? Where can I find this information?
[2014-11-17 08:44:44] jimevans: eric__: i wouldn't count on waitForPageToLoad to work for webdriverbackedselenium.
[2014-11-17 08:45:28] *jimevans cues his rant on how "when is my page loaded?" is a meaningless question in today's web'
[2014-11-17 08:46:25] scf: jimevans: what if take screenshout would leave window as is after resizing and taking capture?
[2014-11-17 08:47:07] jimevans: scf: not gonna happen. that'll adversely effect future interactions with elements.
[2014-11-17 08:47:28] scf: jimevans: as it does now :)
[2014-11-17 08:47:42] jimevans: think about an element you want to click on that is off-screen. how will the OS send the appropriate mouse messages to a place where it can't actually get to?

[2014-11-17 08:48:07] jimevans: dimacus: isn't there a screen capture facility in grid-extras?
[2014-11-17 08:48:12] scf: now recall my case with hovering :)
[2014-11-17 08:48:27] jimevans: scf: we're not going to get anywhere with this.
[2014-11-17 08:48:31] dimacus: jimevans: yeah there is
[2014-11-17 08:48:38] dimacus: working out all the kinks of video capture
[2014-11-17 08:48:45] dimacus: but individual screenshots work reliably
[2014-11-17 08:49:12] jimevans: scf: as i said, the API specifies what the API does. if you can figure out a way to get a full-dom screenshot (which the API specifies) in IE without resizing the window, i'm happy to consider it.
[2014-11-17 08:49:28] scf: I see
[2014-11-17 08:49:29] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-17 08:49:33] jimevans: the so-called "scroll-and-stitch" method is a non-starter as well.
[2014-11-17 08:50:14] dimacus: jimevans: so i was playing around with the idea of using the "print" and "save as pdf" to render the full page and save it… is that completely insane?
[2014-11-17 08:50:24] eric__: eh,  the redirect is not the issue. I get the same error if I hardcode the correct address
[2014-11-17 08:50:40] eric__: jimevans: ty ty
[2014-11-17 08:51:18] jimevans: dimacus: that's not a cross-platform solution.
[2014-11-17 08:51:37] jimevans: at least not for all versions of all browsers.
[2014-11-17 08:51:39] dimacus: i know… just having wild thoughts… never know which strand of spaghetti will stick to the wall
[2014-11-17 08:52:18] jimevans: might work, but it'll go through the print renderer of the browser, which often looks different from the screen renderer.
[2014-11-17 08:52:32] jimevans: (think pagination)
[2014-11-17 08:53:09] dimacus: yeah that's very true
[2014-11-17 08:53:22] dimacus: and it does often move things around
[2014-11-17 08:55:07] eric__: jimevans: do you know how to debug what the RemoteWebDriver is actually doing? (might be a really dumb question)

[2014-11-17 12:51:56] ato: barancev, AutomatedTester: So since this is non-e10s Firefox, I guess this could happen if you call .quit() on a session that has visited a site that uses a plugin (like Flash) and Firefox by chance uses a lot of memory: That will cause the shutdown to take some time, which UnixProcess.java will interpret as the process not responding and it will try to
[2014-11-17 12:51:56] ato: interrupt it.  This might cascade (?) down through the process group and cause the plugin process to be killed, which the plugin container wrapper process will interpret as if the plugin crashed?
[2014-11-17 12:52:51] AutomatedTester: ato: maybe but plugin-container crashing shouldnt affect firefox stability
[2014-11-17 12:53:26] ato: Well it displays this message, so it doesn't appear to be the plugin container that crashes.
[2014-11-17 12:53:59] ato: Or maybe it forks itself to make sure the user sees the message or something which I guess is technically possible to do on Windows.
[2014-11-17 12:54:02] barancev: yes, a message window appears

[2014-11-17 14:22:47] stephend: in this case, it was on a Mac -- but looks like the same issue

[2014-11-17 14:23:52] stephend: looks like we only got the VMs, so I'm guessing no

[2014-11-17 14:24:36] AutomatedTester: stephend: that error tends to mean that something is blocking the port. If it was working and now isnt there has been a bad shutdown and that port is not being released for some reason
