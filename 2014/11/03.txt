[2014-11-03 05:14:57] *ato runs away'
[2014-11-03 05:14:57] barancev: old Firefoxes (e.g. 24) sometimes throw "TypeError: Argument 3 of Document.evaluate does not implement interface XPathNSResolver."
[2014-11-03 05:15:25] barancev: but according to the docs the 3rd parameter can be a function
[2014-11-03 05:16:36] barancev: what does FF mean by "does not implement interface"?
[2014-11-03 05:17:03] barancev: how does it determine this?
[2014-11-03 05:17:43] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: I would assume that the method in the XPathNSResolver does not have a third argument or the third argument is not of the type you're tryhing to pass
[2014-11-03 05:17:58] WhereIsMySpoon: i know 0 about the code but would assume thats what it means
[2014-11-03 05:18:27] WhereIsMySpoon: seems more likely that its the latter
[2014-11-03 05:18:39] WhereIsMySpoon: that argument 3 is supposed to be a type that implements the interface XPathNSResolver
[2014-11-03 05:18:39] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: read about document.evaluate :)
[2014-11-03 05:19:45] barancev: usually FF accepts a function, but sometimes (!) it demands an object that "implements" XPathNSResolver
[2014-11-03 05:19:50] ato: Maybe you need https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.createNSResolver?
[2014-11-03 05:20:16] ato: Call that on the element node and pass in its return value as the third argument?
[2014-11-03 05:20:28] barancev: ato: if I create an object with document.createNSResolver -- how can I add custom namespaces to this resolver?
[2014-11-03 05:20:50] barancev: there are no methods to add namespaces
[2014-11-03 05:21:20] cable, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-03 05:21:42] ato: barancev: Oh I see your point, I've done this before actually.
[2014-11-03 05:21:43] barancev: that's why documentation recommends to use a function as a resolver if you want custom namespaces
[2014-11-03 05:21:44] ato: barancev: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Introduction_to_using_XPath_in_JavaScript#Implementing_a_User_Defined_Namespace_Resolver
[2014-11-03 05:22:47] barancev: yes, I read this carefully, but the fuction sometimes (!!!) does not work in old Firefoxes (namely, 24)
[2014-11-03 05:22:54] ato: Ah.
[2014-11-03 05:22:58] ato: Bug maybe?
[2014-11-03 05:23:18] barancev: may be. but I want a workaround :)
[2014-11-03 05:23:53] barancev: I just need to understand what object should I create instead of the function
[2014-11-03 05:24:19] barancev: how FF determines if an object implemets this interface or not?
[2014-11-03 05:24:40] barancev: it is JavaScript! there is no "implements" in the language
[2014-11-03 05:25:37] ato: Gecko uses interfaces internally which I think what is passed in as an argument must implement all the characteristics of.
[2014-11-03 05:26:16] barancev: yes, yes! how to find out -- what characteristics?

[2014-11-03 05:26:57] barancev: I'm going to try an object that has lookupNamespaceURI method
[2014-11-03 05:27:48] ato: Well the interface is defined by dom/webidl/XPathNSResolver.webidl, but that doesn't really help us.
[2014-11-03 05:30:11] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-03 05:31:35] ato: I thought it was just a function like you said, but there's clearly a regression here.
[2014-11-03 05:31:48] ato: Maybe it worked in previous Firefox' before 24 and was broken somewhere, then fixed later.
[2014-11-03 05:32:09] barancev: I think so
[2014-11-03 05:32:34] barancev: but I wonder why it is not fixed in the latest FF24 ESR revision
[2014-11-03 05:32:54] bimmelino1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-03 05:32:59] barancev: that is 24.8.1
[2014-11-03 05:35:01] ato: The patch has probably not been deemed important enough to be uplifted.
[2014-11-03 05:35:24] ato: It would be useful if we could find the bug number though.  That would give us some more information to go on.

[2014-11-03 07:07:18] Dave_B_: should just be -n20
[2014-11-03 07:07:23] Dave_B_: as far as I can see
[2014-11-03 07:07:32] Dave_B_: but I've enver used xdist I'm afraid :(

[2014-11-03 07:08:11] jim31432423423: yeah, so I've tried -n 20 and -n20 (no difference) I've also used -d -tx 20*popen//python=python
[2014-11-03 07:08:27] jim31432423423: both give same results, small variance in completion time
[2014-11-03 07:08:58] Dave_B_: if you watch your grid hub we should be able to rule out grid problems by seeing how many nodes report taken & if any queue forms
[2014-11-03 07:09:00] jim31432423423: Hey AutomatedTester I actually read this http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2011/pytest_and_xdist_plugin.html

[2014-11-03 07:09:39] jim31432423423: Sure, what exactly am I looking for in the grid hub? Do I need to start it with some kind of verbose flag?
[2014-11-03 07:09:58] Dave_B_: nah normal hub console page should do you unless it's changed since I last used it
[2014-11-03 07:10:38] jim31432423423: ok, looking
[2014-11-03 07:10:57] Dave_B_: do you see 4 nodes, each with 5 firefox icons?
[2014-11-03 07:11:22] jim31432423423: yes

[2014-11-03 07:13:09] jim31432423423: Dave_B_: correct
[2014-11-03 07:13:26] sgsabbage: yeah, that's not a selenium issue then, it looks like xdist is not letting you open more sub processes than you have CPUs
[2014-11-03 07:13:34] sgsabbage: like you said originally ;)

[2014-11-03 07:15:37] jim31432423423: the question then becomes, I'm using xdist wrong (ie. there's a setting/flag I can use to fix this)
[2014-11-03 07:16:04] jim31432423423: or should I use the multiprocessing lib and wrap pytest in that
[2014-11-03 07:16:11] Dave_B_: docs don't make it clear if you can spawn more threads than you've got cores - I'd have thought you'd be able to but then I thought it'd jsut be the -n flag :(

[2014-11-03 08:23:30] gdude2002: o/ all, having an issue with the python driver
[2014-11-03 08:24:11] gdude2002: Attempting to use it to interact with the in-page JS API of a website, the problem I'm facing is that it appears that concurrently accessing the driver is throwing an exception
[2014-11-03 08:24:18] lampd1_, changing nick to lampd1.
[2014-11-03 08:24:42] gdude2002: which appears to be related to the fact that the HTTPConnection in the httplib (part of the python stl) raises an exception if we try to make a request when there's one currently already going out
[2014-11-03 08:24:51] gdude2002: Anyone experienced this one/have a workaround, or is this a bug?
[2014-11-03 08:25:01] WhereIsMySpoon: gdude2002: make a simple queue or synchronize your calls?
[2014-11-03 08:25:26] gdude2002: WhereIsMySpoon: it's a twisted application so it's asynchronous by nature; I could use a queue and spam deferreds everywhere but it doesn't seem like a good solution
[2014-11-03 08:25:50] WhereIsMySpoon: what on earth are you doing with webdriver that you need concurrency
[2014-11-03 08:25:54] WhereIsMySpoon: :gist
[2014-11-03 08:25:54] selbot2__: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[2014-11-03 08:26:07] gdude2002: Alright, hold on, let me mount my ramdisk
[2014-11-03 08:27:53] gdude2002: WhereIsMySpoon: https://gist.github.com/gdude2002/0ba02d1bede4ca51766e
[2014-11-03 08:27:56] gdude2002: actual python is in the second file
[2014-11-03 08:28:07] gdude2002: the first one is what we inject into the page to make it usable
[2014-11-03 08:28:22] gdude2002: I'll point out stuff since you probably don't want to read a ton of code
[2014-11-03 08:28:43] WhereIsMySpoon: plus i dont code in python, so that would be great
[2014-11-03 08:28:49] gdude2002: Heh, alright
[2014-11-03 08:29:05] WhereIsMySpoon: i can read it mostly fine, carry on
[2014-11-03 08:29:10] gdude2002: On #187 we start polling the page, on the page we've placed a queue which will be populated with events thrown from the plug.dj API that we're trying to interact with
[2014-11-03 08:29:34] gdude2002: that gets polled.. roughly every 0,05 seconds or so (too fast?)
[2014-11-03 08:29:59] gdude2002: That's done asynchronously, since we're using Twisted
[2014-11-03 08:30:05] gdude2002: So, someone on plug.dj might use a command
[2014-11-03 08:30:28] gdude2002: We'd have to use the driver to run some JS to respond to that, and a few times that's happened at the same time we're polling the driver for the queue I mentioned before
[2014-11-03 08:30:30] WhereIsMySpoon: wait, you're using webdriver as an actual part of your application?
[2014-11-03 08:30:39] gdude2002: Yeah, it's basically the only option we could think of
[2014-11-03 08:30:45] gdude2002: the site doesn't provie any kind of external API
[2014-11-03 08:30:49] gdude2002: provide*
[2014-11-03 08:30:52] WhereIsMySpoon: =/
[2014-11-03 08:31:04] gdude2002: But the demand is there, so.. Might as well at least try
[2014-11-03 08:31:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i could almost guarantee that it hasnt been tested for concurrency
[2014-11-03 08:31:11] WhereIsMySpoon: it is a testing tool
[2014-11-03 08:31:17] WhereIsMySpoon: not a production application tool
[2014-11-03 08:31:22] gdude2002: Yeah, I know selenium is for testing, I wouldn't be surprised if this would break it
[2014-11-03 08:31:38] gdude2002: But at the same time, if I can get it to work, well, then that's another working protocol
[2014-11-03 08:31:54] WhereIsMySpoon: so basically what you're doing is polling for events, then using webdriver to execute js scripts based on the events coming back
[2014-11-03 08:31:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-11-03 08:32:00] gdude2002: Yeah
[2014-11-03 08:32:20] gdude2002: Well, that's not necessarily all, it could be called from other connections in the application as well
[2014-11-03 08:32:24] gdude2002: but, yeah, at the moment
[2014-11-03 08:32:28] WhereIsMySpoon: what does webdriver allow you to do that you cant do with normal js
[2014-11-03 08:32:41] gdude2002: The application is written in python.
[2014-11-03 08:32:43] WhereIsMySpoon: what is the sole main thing or few things that it is giving you
[2014-11-03 08:32:46] WhereIsMySpoon: python then
[2014-11-03 08:32:48] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry
[2014-11-03 08:32:51] gdude2002: Oh, right, sorry
[2014-11-03 08:33:06] gdude2002: Well, plug.dj is a website, the only API they've provided is the on-page JS API
[2014-11-03 08:33:42] gdude2002: So it would be impossible to interface with that way without a browser of some sort
[2014-11-03 08:33:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ah and so something happens on the website, you detect it with webdriver via dom change, and then react?
[2014-11-03 08:33:59] gdude2002: Well, their API provides some events that can callback JS
[2014-11-03 08:34:12] gdude2002: So I just catch those and throw them into an array, which is what the driver is polling
[2014-11-03 08:34:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i feel like a simple js plugin/library that you write to do some simple callback injection and polling would be better
[2014-11-03 08:35:20] gdude2002: I was going to use PyV8 for it but it's horrible to install, and I don't think my users would want to bother with it
[2014-11-03 08:35:57] WhereIsMySpoon: gdude2002: feel free to download the source for selenium and try to make the httpconnection part concurrency friendly
[2014-11-03 08:36:19] WhereIsMySpoon: im not a selenium dev but id be surprised if thats high on their priorities
[2014-11-03 08:36:25] gdude2002: yeah, you're probably right
[2014-11-03 08:36:31] *WhereIsMySpoon pokes barancev'
[2014-11-03 08:36:44] gdude2002: I may hang around for a bit anyways, I mean I could simply shove a mutex in there but that doesn't seem like the solution either
[2014-11-03 08:36:54] WhereIsMySpoon: gdude2002: thats what my initial thought was too
[2014-11-03 08:37:17] gdude2002: Would have to be very careful with deadlocking
[2014-11-03 08:39:38] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry but im now not very useful any more
[2014-11-03 08:39:53] gdude2002: Heh, it's okay, I appreciate your help
[2014-11-03 08:40:10] gdude2002: I realise this isn't really what selenium is supposed to do, but it can't hurt to try
[2014-11-03 08:40:16] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2014-11-03 08:40:19] WhereIsMySpoon: doenst hurt to try

[2014-11-03 09:20:17] gdude2002: there's no way to get at that without modifying the code/subclassing, but it's something

[2014-11-03 09:25:28] WhereIsMySpoon: gdude2002: possible that if keep-alive isnt true, then when it queries the web page, webelements that were previously valid may become stale

[2014-11-03 12:54:20] Ragnaroek: but why do i have to specify the path to the exe in the capabilites and not on launching the node?
[2014-11-03 12:54:47] barancev: dimacus: not bad, only 29 failures -- http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/view/Safari%20Tests/job/Safari%206%20MacOS%20Java%20Tests/
[2014-11-03 12:55:14] dimacus: only 29… i guess that's not a bad starting point
[2014-11-03 12:55:23] dimacus: what is the command to run the full suite?
[2014-11-03 12:55:47] barancev: from the IDE? or from the console?
[2014-11-03 12:56:03] dimacus: i'll take either
[2014-11-03 12:56:05] barancev: go test_safari
[2014-11-03 12:56:48] dimacus: ok thanks, i'll start looking at those tests tomorrow
[2014-11-03 12:57:27] barancev: ElementFindingTest failures should be easy to fix
[2014-11-03 12:57:55] barancev: only negative tests are broken, it is not very important

[2014-11-03 12:59:55] barancev: the only serious set of broken test are cookie tests
[2014-11-03 13:00:11] dimacus: yeah i noticed that too in our grid
[2014-11-03 13:00:19] dimacus: that's the one that will deff need fixing for me
[2014-11-03 13:01:38] barancev: they are broken because of precondition -- the old cookies are not removed
[2014-11-03 13:02:13] barancev: so probably "delete cookie" operation is broken only
[2014-11-03 13:02:29] dimacus: are you saying test polution or delete cookie method?
[2014-11-03 13:02:58] barancev: I don't know, tests reuse the browser
[2014-11-03 13:03:15] barancev: so it is pollution, yes
[2014-11-03 13:03:16] dimacus: ok i guess i'll figure it out first thing tomorrow
[2014-11-03 13:03:42] barancev: but there is a teardown method that should perform cleanup
[2014-11-03 13:04:12] barancev: there should not be pollution, in theory
[2014-11-03 13:04:56] dimacus: yeah in theory… that's always so true though :-P

[2014-11-03 14:05:10] KyleG: How do you guys handle testing your application when you have writes going to a MySQL master and reads going to a MySQL slave?
[2014-11-03 14:05:58] KyleG: Robots are obviously faster than humans, so we end up seeing instances where the test cannot find the data because the slave has not gotten it yet. But our servers are tuned quite well, and there's no actual lag. I expect that the obvious is that mySQL replication does take time obviously, it's not an instant mirror, so a delay may have to be added to tests for this purpose.

[2014-11-03 15:41:29] Tuplario, quitting. (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[2014-11-03 15:41:50] RajatJindal: I wanted to ask one question about how selenium server communicates with remote server
[2014-11-03 15:42:27] Mixologi-: What could cause selenium server to randomly fail to find an element in a firefox session?  I have a test that succeeds, however a particular xpath search *randomly* fails to find the h1 on the page. I can immediately execute the same curl request to the selenium session and it will then find it. Is there a known bug or issue or has this been fixed recently (im on 2.42.2 standalone)
[2014-11-03 15:42:31] RajatJindal: if for some reason one of the request to remote server is stuck, will selenium server process further requests to remote server or it is sequential?
[2014-11-03 15:43:39] RajatJindal: mixologi: try using waitUntil that element is visible
[2014-11-03 15:44:28] RajatJindal: can someone please answer my question
[2014-11-03 15:44:33] Mixologi-: RajatJindal: Im interacting with the selenium standalone server - i.e all of my interaction is with rest callbacks

[2014-11-03 15:45:14] RajatJindal: u can implement custom waitForElement function, we have developed wait_until in our perl implementation
[2014-11-03 15:46:46] Mixologi-: RajatJindal: gotcha, so basically when I run a search for //html/descendant-or-self::h1, the possibility exists that the browser that is being driven hasnt yet received all of its data?
[2014-11-03 15:47:32] Mixologi-: I had assumed that element/2/click would not return a result until that data had been received.

[2014-11-03 15:47:59] RajatJindal: yep it could be that. its always good to wait for element before performing action on it
[2014-11-03 15:48:58] RajatJindal: btw, //html/descendant-or-self::h1 looks like a really bad xpath. you should probably ask devs to give this element an id or name
[2014-11-03 15:49:26] Mixologi-: Actually its a more generic part of a test that allows for "I should see a header"
[2014-11-03 15:49:44] Mixologi-: that loops through all h1->h6 on the page and looks if that header exists somewhere.
[2014-11-03 15:50:18] Mixologi-: so, not a very specific test case, but useful enough for certain steps
[2014-11-03 15:50:31] RajatJindal: sure
[2014-11-03 15:56:04] RajatJindal: repeating my question to ensure its not stuck behind other conversation we had:
[2014-11-03 15:56:05] RajatJindal:  if for some reason one of the request to remote server is stuck, will selenium server process further requests to remote server or it is sequential?
