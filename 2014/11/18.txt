[2014-11-18 00:37:39] wdj: Hi, how are you guys solving the issue with drivers and the fact that they take quite a lot of space in the repository and on disk? I have this Maven project where the drivers are checked in with the drawback that we need to update them one in a while.
[2014-11-18 00:37:50] wdj: But it takes a lof of disk space when running the tests in Jenkins as the drivers are placed in each workspace, and the repository grows quite large. Are there a smarter way of doing it? I was thinking about automatically downloading the drivers if they are not present on disk and placing them in a central location that can be utilized by all tests, but I am not sure that I can trust that the drivers always will be available online.
[2014-11-18 00:38:33] wdj: Which means that I would have to store them on a local server as well, which would make the code dependent on configuration which is something I donÂ´t want. But perhaps that is the way to go....
[2014-11-18 00:44:57] barancev: wdj: "large repository" is a maven problem, don't use maven if it bothers you

[2014-11-18 10:39:33] jimevans: because anyone who ever thinks my code is perfect *must* be in an altered state of consciousness.
