[2014-11-13 07:13:07] jimevans: in a sense, i suppose it's the least i can do after inflicting the IE driver on the world. :)
[2014-11-13 07:13:37] scf: jimevans: do you have a clue when microsoft will implement mouse actions in their driver?
[2014-11-13 07:15:01] jimevans: scf: i don't have any special insights into their development process. i did send them a list of my top three and next three prioritized issues. mouse actions didn't make the cut. mostly because they'll get there, but that's a part of the :spec that needs to solidify before they can really do an implementation.

[2014-11-13 07:17:07] jimevans: for those interested in my list, my top three issues were frame switching, element.getText, and element.findElement (or the remote-end equivalents). my next three were async alert handling, full element location strategies (including xpath), and get element tag name.
[2014-11-13 07:18:02] scf: aha
[2014-11-13 07:18:45] almostwhitehat, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 07:19:24] jimevans: once that list of features is implemented, i can get a good handle on how compliant their implementation is with the open-source project's expectations by running the webdriver project's test suite against it. at the moment, it's a nonstarter without those features.
[2014-11-13 07:19:50] scf: jimevans: we have troubles with IE and hovering/clicking. We could live with requirement of IE window being focused if it worked properly. Is it easy to patch selenium ie driver to move real mouse pointer instead of virtual?
[2014-11-13 07:20:38] scf: jimevans: their current driver has different json wire format :\
[2014-11-13 07:20:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I saw that IE is implementing xpath

[2014-11-13 07:21:10] jimevans: :)
[2014-11-13 07:21:44] jimevans: scf: so if you've read my blog, you know that you don't need to worry about their json wire format. just use IEDriverServer.exe.
[2014-11-13 07:21:56] scf: I did
[2014-11-13 07:22:07] jimevans: or won't once their next update comes out.
[2014-11-13 07:22:15] jimevans: because of the element reference serialization

[2014-11-13 07:24:15] jimevans: so you have a couple of options.
[2014-11-13 07:24:21] jimevans: first, try turning off native events.
[2014-11-13 07:24:39] jimevans: second, try forcing window focus with the "requireWindowFocus" capability
[2014-11-13 07:24:40] rodrigomartin, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 07:25:00] scf: jimevans: doesn't help :)
[2014-11-13 07:25:02] jimevans: again i point to my blog for discussions of those approaches.
[2014-11-13 07:25:22] jimevans: if you have a specific repro case that doesn't work, i can take a look.
[2014-11-13 07:25:32] jimevans: moving the actual mouse pointer will be challenging.

[2014-11-13 07:26:19] jimevans: the interaction code is localized to InputManager.cpp, but it'll be tricky to get it working properly. coordinate translation alone is going to be a pain in the neck.
[2014-11-13 07:27:32] jimevans: when you say it "doesn't help", what doesn't work? i'm cognizant of the fact that the driver sucks, but i can't fix "sucks".

[2014-11-13 07:27:56] scf: fault
[2014-11-13 07:28:00] jimevans: if you can be more specific, i might be able to provide better guidance.
[2014-11-13 07:28:31] scf: jimevans: it seems I made hover events work kind of stable by moving physical mouse out of the IE window
[2014-11-13 07:29:04] jimevans: the requireWindowFocus capability is the closest you'll get to "actual" mouse movement. the SendInput api is actually duplicating the events the physical mouse generates into the Windows mouse event queue.
[2014-11-13 07:29:06] scf: but mouseDown/mouseUp do not work properly

[2014-11-13 07:30:44] scf: hm
[2014-11-13 07:31:26] jimevans: or if you turn off native events.
[2014-11-13 07:31:48] jimevans: both capability settings will disable so-called "persistent hover"

[2014-11-13 07:35:36] scf: one thing I forgot to mention: there is not the latest version of selenium and stuff
[2014-11-13 07:35:44] jimevans: i seem to recall an issue with earlier versions of IE with block elements that wouldn't register mouse events when containing an inline element unless you actually hovered over the text of the inline element.
[2014-11-13 07:35:53] jimevans: but my recollection is extremely vague on that.
[2014-11-13 07:36:29] jimevans: so what versions are you using?
[2014-11-13 07:36:56] jimevans: and again, i say, if you have a reproducible case, i'll gladly take a look.

[2014-11-13 08:06:01] jimevans: ato: you're right, it's a bit confusing. the editors' draft hasn't been updated to incorporate the changes discussed at tpac, has it AutomatedTester?
[2014-11-13 08:06:12] ato: I'm implementing Selenium here.
[2014-11-13 08:06:14] ato: Not the spec.
[2014-11-13 08:06:21] jimevans: oh.
[2014-11-13 08:07:24] jimevans: from the client side, using current implementations as a guide, the message field is textual only. usually, it contains a reason for the error; most language bindings take the status code and throw the appropriate exception type based on that.
[2014-11-13 08:07:41] jimevans: at least that's what the .net and java bindings do
[2014-11-13 08:08:03] ato: So should a response be {"sessionId": …, "status": 9, "value": {"message": "getMarionetteID", "stacktrace": …}}?
[2014-11-13 08:08:15] ato: Or {"sessionId": …, "status": 9, "message": "getMarionetteID", "stacktrace": …}

[2014-11-13 08:10:42] ato: Yeah, I'm not looking forward to changing this to be spec compliant.
[2014-11-13 08:10:52] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 08:11:02] ato: Mostly due to the internal consumers of Marionette.
[2014-11-13 08:11:17] jimevans: hoo boy, got a whole slew of language binding changes that'll be required for that.
[2014-11-13 08:11:46] jimevans: and i'm really, *really*, REALLY not looking forward to protocol-sniffing to figure out which one to use.
[2014-11-13 08:12:07] *jimevans grumbles about simonstewart and backward compatibility'
[2014-11-13 08:12:59] jimevans: actually, i may just quit once the spec goes recommendation, and someone else can clean up the mess about making the .net bindings a drop-in replacement.
[2014-11-13 08:13:54] ato: I mentioned this to him in Santa Clara but he seemed very convinced it was possible.
[2014-11-13 08:14:12] jimevans: ever the optimist, he.
[2014-11-13 08:14:31] jimevans: i know how it's going to play out.
[2014-11-13 08:14:35] ato: There was a thread on selenium-developers@ a while back where I raised some concerns I had about breaking backwards compatibility.
[2014-11-13 08:14:41] ato: Which he dispelled.
[2014-11-13 08:15:49] jimevans: he'll put a starting implementation into the java bindings, being the "pioneer" he is, then leave the cleanup work for java and the rest of the language binding maintainers to scramble to keep up.
[2014-11-13 08:16:40] jimevans: not that it's a bad thing, but the challenge is that java is "special"
[2014-11-13 08:16:57] jimevans: and that gets lost in translation sometimes.

[2014-11-13 08:21:04] ato: jimevans: I know how fun it is to debug the server.  It does some crazy stuff sometimes.
[2014-11-13 08:23:10] jimevans: a protocol sniffing solution to the "are you spec compliant" question is ugly and massively inelegant
[2014-11-13 08:24:18] jimevans: and i *hate* the fact that we're not willing to introduce breaking api changes in a major-version release.
[2014-11-13 08:24:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we are going to have to
[2014-11-13 08:24:47] ato: I can sympathise with that.
[2014-11-13 08:24:51] jimevans: especially if they break at compile time, where it's easy to find and fix them.
[2014-11-13 08:24:55] ato: AutomatedTester: simonstewart's plan is to hide it in the server.
[2014-11-13 08:25:10] AutomatedTester: ato: in which server?
[2014-11-13 08:25:12] jimevans: (disclaimer for non-compiled/interpreted languages. no sympathy. :) )
[2014-11-13 08:25:13] ato: The Selenium server.
[2014-11-13 08:25:22] AutomatedTester: ato: in all of them?
[2014-11-13 08:25:24] ato: To write a sniffer which will detect and convert 2-to-3.
[2014-11-13 08:25:35] ato: For Java.
[2014-11-13 08:25:42] ato: There's only one Selenium server.
[2014-11-13 08:25:57] AutomatedTester: but what about people who dont want to install java
[2014-11-13 08:25:59] jimevans: yeah, but that's my point, that all of that work has to be duplicated in any language bindings
[2014-11-13 08:26:01] AutomatedTester: like .net people
[2014-11-13 08:26:06] AutomatedTester: ruby people
[2014-11-13 08:26:19] ato: Yeah.
[2014-11-13 08:26:28] *AutomatedTester remembers people not wanting to install other runtimes coming up before'
[2014-11-13 08:26:39] ato: The intention is good though.  For protocol version 2 clients to be able to speak to version 3 servers.
[2014-11-13 08:26:55] ato: And vice versa.
[2014-11-13 08:26:59] AutomatedTester: I am not doubting the intention at all
[2014-11-13 08:27:00] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm one of the loudest and most vocal proponents of "don't make me install other language runtimes".
[2014-11-13 08:27:49] jimevans: of course, "version 3" isn't spec-compliant anyway.
[2014-11-13 08:28:11] jimevans: so we've kicked that proverbial can down the road a little.
[2014-11-13 08:28:21] ato: I think it should be relatively easy to accommodate this in the Ruby client because it has a clear distinction between protocol and API.
[2014-11-13 08:28:24] jimevans: but it's the v3-v4 transition that's going to be painful

[2014-11-13 09:36:34] ato: We still use autoconf.
[2014-11-13 09:36:48] ato: Which makes me weep everytime I type `./mach build` into my shell.
[2014-11-13 09:37:04] ato: Maven > autoconf
[2014-11-13 09:37:10] ato: I know it's hard to believe.

[2014-11-13 09:37:17] lukeis: we don't really use maven yet...
[2014-11-13 09:37:28] lukeis: we still use ant to sometimes shell out to maven
[2014-11-13 09:38:34] lukeis: actually we have a custom script runner… (written in a mix of bash and python) that then calls the ant targets needed (which then call maven)  o.0

[2014-11-13 09:42:31] jimevans: i still can't update the entire project to use VS 2013 yet.

[2014-11-13 09:42:51] jimevans: because gecko sdk obj files are VS2010.

[2014-11-13 09:45:22] dude-x: if you were to hire a Lead QA Test Engineer, what are the kinds of questions you will ask to find out if they're a good manager
[2014-11-13 09:46:00] KyleG: dude-x: Our "Lead QA Test Engineer" is looked at as a very senior engineer, not so much a manager.
[2014-11-13 09:46:04] KyleG: We have a director of QA for that purpose.
[2014-11-13 09:46:40] KyleG: Let the engineers do the good work and move the company forward, don't bother a talented engineer with managerial duties.
[2014-11-13 09:46:55] dude-x: hmm. i guess this role is more like a director but he or she has to work with the QA team on tickets as well, if not full time
[2014-11-13 09:47:26] ato: dude-x: People manager?  I'd find out how they make plans, manage expectations from consumers internally/externally vs. e.g. fixing technical debt, handle conflicts, people not delivering, how they delegate work, &c.

[2014-11-13 10:32:19] jimevans: that answer explains why there are very very few methods on the ExpectedConditions class in the .NET bindings.

[2014-11-13 10:35:28] jimevans: you could, but the standard WebDriverWait will already catch the exception for FindElement, if the element doesn't exist.
[2014-11-13 10:35:46] mtscout6_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 10:35:55] jimevans: but yes, you'll probably need to do that, if the element you're looking for really isn't in the DOM.

[2014-11-13 10:36:32] scf, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 10:37:25] jimevans: you'll need to cater to all of the possible cases. that is that the element is not in the DOM (NoSuchElementException); that the element was in the DOM, but is no longer so (StaleElementException); and that the element is properly in the DOM, but is not visible (!element.IsDisplayed).
[2014-11-13 10:37:53] joesmith: i'm actually taking over some code and there's a custom method called WaitUntilNotVisible() which currently checks the visible attribute. however this fails sometimes when the element no longer exists, so i'm trying to make it smarter
[2014-11-13 10:37:58] jimevans: it depends on what you're *really* needing to wait for.
[2014-11-13 10:38:30] scf_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 10:38:40] jimevans: sounds like try-catch is your friend.
[2014-11-13 10:38:42] joesmith: i think in this particular test, it's that the close button was actually clicked and now isn't there anymore (the popup was closed)
[2014-11-13 10:39:48] jimevans: that's a slightly different issue then, because the window with the "focus" isn't valid any longer, but the same principle applies.

[2014-11-13 10:48:39] scf: jimevans: I mean if I have 64bit windows should I use 64 bit java and iedriverserver?

[2014-11-13 10:49:28] jimevans: scf: the "bit-ness" of the java runtime and IEDriverServer.exe are orthogonal to one another.
[2014-11-13 10:50:03] jimevans: using the 64-bit IEDriverServer has performance implications.
[2014-11-13 10:51:33] scf: jimevans: Im asking because I see via task manager that both driver and IE are 32bit. So I guess this is ok
[2014-11-13 10:51:46] jimevans: scf: what version of IE again?
[2014-11-13 10:51:52] scf: jimevans: IE9
[2014-11-13 10:51:56] jimevans: ah right.
[2014-11-13 10:52:35] jimevans: okay, so you can use the 64-bit IE driver, but realize that very, very few of your users will be using it.
[2014-11-13 10:53:17] jimevans: plus the javascript engine in 64-bit IE9 is slower than the 32-bit one.
[2014-11-13 10:53:47] scf: I see so it's ok. thanks

[2014-11-13 10:54:39] jimevans: scf: if you want to move to IE10 or IE11, you probably want to use the 32-bit IE driver exclusively.

[2014-11-13 11:47:11] zergling_: what is jquery doing to fetch all li elements that selenium is failing to do?
[2014-11-13 11:47:38] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 780
[2014-11-13 11:48:07] zergling_: (new WebDriverWait(driver, timeOutInSeconds)).until(presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy(cssSelector(".li"))) fails
[2014-11-13 11:48:34] zergling_: using javascript executor on $(".li") apparently works.
[2014-11-13 11:48:49] zergling_: why does Selenium have to behave so badly
[2014-11-13 11:50:14] jimevans: zergling_: i don't grant your premise (selenium "behaving badly")
[2014-11-13 11:50:47] zergling_: either way, if i wanted to just go with javascript, why wouldn't i use phantom
[2014-11-13 11:50:50] fabrice31, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2014-11-13 11:50:56] zergling_: or whatever htmlunit or something else
[2014-11-13 11:51:13] zergling_: i'm not going to go full stack language writing just so I can wrap jquery
[2014-11-13 11:51:22] jimevans: i don't know, why wouldn't you? except that no user will ever browse your site using those browsers.
[2014-11-13 11:51:28] jimevans: unit tests ftw.
[2014-11-13 11:51:32] jarib: zergling_: perhaps you could provide a :testcase that demonstrates your problem
[2014-11-13 11:51:33] selbot2: Please read http://sscce.org/
[2014-11-13 11:51:43] zergling_: i've just described it.
[2014-11-13 11:51:59] zergling_: selecting LI elements is different when using a javascript selector with jquery vs using selenium api
[2014-11-13 11:52:10] zergling_: jquery is apparently doing something more robust than whatever javascript selenium is doing
[2014-11-13 11:52:16] jarib: i know that's not true in general
[2014-11-13 11:52:22] jarib: it may be true in your case
[2014-11-13 11:52:23] jimevans: so you're looking for all elements where the containing a class attribute of 'li' (that's what your posted code will do)
[2014-11-13 11:52:49] jarib: but unless you can show me how to reproduce it, there's no reason for me to look into it
[2014-11-13 11:53:04] zergling_: u want access to the internal website?
[2014-11-13 11:53:04] jimevans: document.querySelectorAll(".li")
[2014-11-13 11:53:37] jarib: zergling_: either that or a reduced case that will reproduce the problem (read the link selbot2 posted)
[2014-11-13 11:54:26] sgsabbage, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 11:54:31] zergling_: lol. sure let me ask the dev ops guy on maternity/paternity leave to let you through firewall
[2014-11-13 11:54:55] zergling_: oh well. i'll attempt to do what jquery is doing
[2014-11-13 11:54:56] jarib: a reduced case it is then. i'll wait
[2014-11-13 11:55:09] zergling_: no thanks
[2014-11-13 11:55:23] zergling_: i'll hack it and give a status that selenium can't automate LI's as robustly as jquery
[2014-11-13 11:55:28] jarib: lol
[2014-11-13 11:55:29] jimevans: seriously, i'm not trying to be a pain.
[2014-11-13 11:55:39] jarib: please do
[2014-11-13 11:56:02] jarib: zergling_: and your selector is not attempting to find LI tags, as jimevans has pointed out
[2014-11-13 11:56:11] jimevans: i just wonder if you're actually executing what you think you're trying to execute.
[2014-11-13 11:56:17] zergling_: the period is a mistake
[2014-11-13 11:56:42] zergling_: i know that, butttt no time to copy paste everything. all i know is that jquery found the items. the webdriver wait is flakey
[2014-11-13 11:56:53] jimevans: okay, next question is in the dev tools of whatever browser you're using, what does document.querySelectorAll() return?
[2014-11-13 11:57:03] eric__, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 11:57:16] zergling_: that won't help...
[2014-11-13 11:57:17] jimevans: (because that's what webdriver delegates down to).
[2014-11-13 11:57:32] zergling_: by the time i click on the console, the state of things wont' be the same
[2014-11-13 11:57:36] jimevans: but you're also using a wait, which will return as soon as the number of elements returned is > 0
[2014-11-13 11:58:05] zergling_: it still times out

[2014-11-13 11:58:35] errant_rider, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-11-13 11:58:51] zergling_: running  document.querySelectorAll() 5 seconds or 10 seconds or whatever time after i click console is not the same as running the query when the page is loaded
[2014-11-13 11:59:12] AutomatedTester: ato: that can be a future patch
[2014-11-13 11:59:14] jimevans: zergling_: agreed. if i gave the impression i thought it was, i apologize.

[2014-11-13 12:00:30] zergling_: oh well.  I thought i was goign to refactor out the jquery but it's more robust than selenium. the code will stay the way it is
[2014-11-13 12:00:44] jimevans: i'm trying to see about getting to the bottom of what you're describing. what you describe is, frankly, uncommon, in my experience.
[2014-11-13 12:01:30] zergling_: we are using angular
[2014-11-13 12:01:45] zergling_: it's probably another timing issue. but i'm still curious as to why the jquery approach just works
[2014-11-13 12:02:15] AutomatedTester: getElementBy* type DOM calls have a live list
[2014-11-13 12:02:20] jimevans: i honestly couldn't say. i don't know how jquery does what it does.
[2014-11-13 12:02:37] AutomatedTester: but you would need to keep that on the browser, passing it back to webdriver makes it immutable in the client
[2014-11-13 12:03:18] jimevans: could be that it "just works" because it's happening on the browser's javascript event loop.
[2014-11-13 12:03:38] zergling_: i'm using getElements plural
[2014-11-13 12:03:58] errant_rider, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 12:04:15] AutomatedTester: the DOM getElement*by* calls tend to be live lists that are returned
[2014-11-13 12:04:57] AutomatedTester: but... if in webdriver, the action of returning it to the client library (python/.net/java/<insert others>) makes it a non-live list on the client side
[2014-11-13 12:05:07] AutomatedTester: and some languages try make the list immutable
[2014-11-13 12:05:27] jimevans: :log
[2014-11-13 12:05:27] selbot2: https://raw.github.com/SeleniumHQ/irc-logs/master/2014/11/13.txt
[2014-11-13 12:06:02] zergling_: groovy driver
[2014-11-13 12:06:10] sgsabbage, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 12:06:29] zergling_: which is essentially java - some edge cases for closures /classes
[2014-11-13 12:06:47] AutomatedTester: I suspect, keeping it in jquery you are letting jquery handle if the list is live/non-live for you
[2014-11-13 12:07:00] zergling_: wouldn't the error seen be some Java exception ?
[2014-11-13 12:07:05] zergling_: if the list is immutable
[2014-11-13 12:08:14] zergling_: hrm. i'm not gonna go down and see if selenium is silently catching errors and ignoring them on immutable lists.
[2014-11-13 12:08:35] *AutomatedTester thinks its query papering over angular magic '
[2014-11-13 12:08:41] AutomatedTester: jquery*
[2014-11-13 12:11:25] jimevans: so my recollection of the java implementation of the expectedcondition of "presenceofallelements" is that it should wait for a list to be returned with a count greater than zero, and findElements shouldn't be throwing an error at all, even if the elements aren't present. but my recollection is hazy on that point, and i'm in the middle of several other things, so i'm not looking at the source code.

[2014-11-13 12:11:53] zergling_: AutomatedTester: i'm not sure i follow
[2014-11-13 12:12:07] zergling_: jquery is including no matter what selenium selector approach I use
[2014-11-13 12:12:11] jimevans: but i *do* know that unless you're using a spectacularly old browser, finding by css selector should simply be dropping down to document.querySelectorAll
[2014-11-13 12:12:11] zergling_: included*
[2014-11-13 12:13:03] AutomatedTester: if jquery is finding $('.li') and document.querySelectorAll('.li') isnt then there is some magic happening
[2014-11-13 12:13:21] AutomatedTester: selenium delegates down to the browser for all the heavy lifting
[2014-11-13 12:13:27] jimevans: but if you're using groovy, that probably means you're using geb.

[2014-11-13 12:19:20] zergling_: sure. there's an element present in the dom. but the user can't see it. selenium clicks it anyways
[2014-11-13 12:19:22] jimevans: i *also* know that there are a fairly large number of tests, run on every commit to webdriver, on a large array of browser versions, that test finding elements by CSS selector, and they're passing.
[2014-11-13 12:19:36] lukeis, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-11-13 12:19:41] jimevans: zergling_: it *shouldn't* click it if the user can't see it. if it does, that's a bug.
[2014-11-13 12:20:31] zergling_: sendInput also sends input at an inhuman non realistic fashion
[2014-11-13 12:20:46] jimevans: sendInput? what's that?
[2014-11-13 12:20:52] zergling_: sendkeys
[2014-11-13 12:21:03] jimevans: alright.
[2014-11-13 12:21:17] zergling_: the code i've inherited has taken the time to put threadsleep(200) between each keypress

[2014-11-13 12:23:52] zergling_: people are angry. not just me
[2014-11-13 12:24:03] jarib: zergling_: if phantomjs provides the necessary level of realism for your tests to give you the confidence you need, that's great. no reason to drag along a big slow browser
[2014-11-13 12:24:11] zergling_: "why are the tests failing" "they are flakey" "no real human would do that"
[2014-11-13 12:24:18] jarib: the problem is that you're not pointing out the problem
[2014-11-13 12:24:29] jarib: if you were, we would be on the case fixing it
[2014-11-13 12:24:37] zergling_: the problem is far bigger than specific flakiness and non human simulation
[2014-11-13 12:24:43] jarib: you're describing a problem that we have no way of reproducing
[2014-11-13 12:25:01] zergling_: jarib, you don't monitor people using selenium in the wild?
[2014-11-13 12:25:10] zergling_: or maybe there's just not enough data
[2014-11-13 12:25:23] jimevans: alex, have you changed your irc nick?
[2014-11-13 12:25:33] zergling_: n
[2014-11-13 12:25:33] jarib: i don't understand what you're saying
[2014-11-13 12:25:42] jarib: i don't "monitor" anyone
[2014-11-13 12:25:49] zergling_: the entire organization is frustrated with the automation efforts at this point in time
[2014-11-13 12:26:11] jarib: yes, and it's very easy to blame the tool and not dig into why things are failing
[2014-11-13 12:26:21] zergling_: the last organization I was at was also frustrated and I didn't even have anything to do with automation at that time
[2014-11-13 12:26:52] jarib: your refusal to even TRY to create a case to reproduce it is just symptomatic
[2014-11-13 12:27:43] zergling_: there's probably not even enough data to find out what the non Selenium project develpers using it to actually try QA are feeling
[2014-11-13 12:28:15] jarib: if you were willing to dig into why it's actually failing, you'd be a lot more successful in writing a stable test suite
[2014-11-13 12:28:26] zergling_: it's stable with Jquery
[2014-11-13 12:28:52] jarib: if it's stable with jquery, why is your entire organization frustrated with the automation efforts?
[2014-11-13 12:29:02] zergling_: but this javascript executor functionality is wrapped in a class called stufftorefactor and concatenating jquery selectors is unreadable
[2014-11-13 12:29:02] jarib: perhaps it's because you keep piling on hacks
[2014-11-13 12:29:15] jarib: like sleeps and calls to jquery
[2014-11-13 12:29:28] jarib: instead of trying to explore the real cause of the problem
[2014-11-13 12:29:40] zergling_: well. if you want to emulate real user interaction, they aren't sendkeys < 1 nanosecond copy pasting. that is a fact
[2014-11-13 12:30:04] jarib: i've never said anything like that
[2014-11-13 12:30:38] zergling_: a developer in here said that phantom js is not valid because no one will use that browser
[2014-11-13 12:30:47] jimevans: zergling_: hang on
[2014-11-13 12:30:48] zergling_: sure. but no one will use applications via selenium web driver either
[2014-11-13 12:30:51] AutomatedTester: zergling_: the browser can cope with <1 nanosec copy/pasting. It can cope with events going into it's queue and building images and rendering at 60 frames a second
[2014-11-13 12:30:57] jimevans: that's a misinterpretation of what i said
[2014-11-13 12:31:05] jimevans: or perhaps i wasn't clear
[2014-11-13 12:31:32] zergling_: <jimevans> i don't know, why wouldn't you? except that no user will ever browse your site using those browsers.
[2014-11-13 12:31:41] jimevans: ui-based, browser-level tests have a place in a solid test infrastructure.
[2014-11-13 12:31:46] zergling_: no one will ever use webdriver to browse either.
[2014-11-13 12:32:10] jimevans: i don't believe that executing those tests using a headless browser is particularly useful.

[2014-11-13 12:32:30] jimevans: i also believe that those should be a very, very small number of your test suite.

[2014-11-13 12:33:04] AutomatedTester: zergling_: people do use webdriver to crawl sites for them... and spammers use webdriver to try create fake accounts
[2014-11-13 12:33:08] zergling_: either way, you see the test going to a blank page, then going to another page because it clicks something the user can't see. the whole "selenium will scroll to whatever you try to interact with" thing is completely undefined behavior
[2014-11-13 12:33:26] zergling_: AutomatedTester: those use cases speak well of selenium lol
[2014-11-13 12:33:45] AutomatedTester: zergling_: selenium is a browser automation tool, not a testing tool

[2014-11-13 12:36:59] zergling_: oh well. time to go for a 4 mile run. health before so called "career"
[2014-11-13 12:37:14] AutomatedTester: zergling_: and jquery creating a superset of css selectors is webdrivers fault how?
[2014-11-13 12:37:53] AutomatedTester: that particular issue should be taken up with the CSS WG at the W3C
[2014-11-13 12:37:57] farlan, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-11-13 12:38:02] nirvdrum: Incidentally, a HN article on slimerjs was full of comments about how flaky phantomjs is.  It's almost as if this shit is just hard.
[2014-11-13 12:38:37] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: funny that... it's like you might need highly specialised people to make it work effectively...
[2014-11-13 12:38:56] AutomatedTester: but... people get what they pay for when they don't get those specialised people
[2014-11-13 12:39:18] nirvdrum: But if your choice is between automating a contrived, headless browser and automating a browser people actually use, one is clearly closer to the problem domain than the other, if your goal is to test a web application that humans will use.
[2014-11-13 12:39:23] nirvdrum: They're not equivalent.
[2014-11-13 12:39:47] nirvdrum: A deficiency in one does not absolve the other of deficiencies and not all deficiencies are of the same magnitude.
[2014-11-13 12:39:55] zergling_: lol we paid 250$/hour for thoughtworks consultants
[2014-11-13 12:40:02] zergling_: and we didn't get the tests any better.
[2014-11-13 12:40:11] nirvdrum: Sounds like you got screwed.
[2014-11-13 12:40:20] nirvdrum: And probably had a bad contract.
[2014-11-13 12:40:21] zergling_: "oh you've got an IE specific webdriver issue? low priority"
[2014-11-13 12:40:59] zergling_: from what i can tell, selenium has history at thoughtworks
[2014-11-13 12:41:11] zergling_: it appears you can't even pay 1000$/hour to get things fixed
[2014-11-13 12:41:16] nirvdrum: I mean, yeah, like 8 years ago.
[2014-11-13 12:41:34] zergling_: there isn't any help because it doesn't exist because the problems can't be fixed
[2014-11-13 12:41:37] nirvdrum: Selenium in its modern incantation is much closer to a product originating from Google.
[2014-11-13 12:41:52] nirvdrum: zergling_: If you want to pay me $1000 / hour, I'll look at your IE issues for you.
[2014-11-13 12:41:54] barancev: dogarrhea, season 2? :)
[2014-11-13 12:42:07] nirvdrum: Currently, I get paid $0 / hour to look at them.
[2014-11-13 12:42:11] zergling_: selenium, season forever bugs
[2014-11-13 12:42:19] nirvdrum: There's a simple solution: don't use it.
[2014-11-13 12:42:23] nirvdrum: All of your problems go away.
[2014-11-13 12:42:29] zergling_: here we go again with claiming 0$ / hour again to work on coporate open source
[2014-11-13 12:42:36] zergling_: let's not go there.
[2014-11-13 12:42:43] nirvdrum: Pray tell, what corporation do you think I work for?
[2014-11-13 12:42:55] zergling_: probably salesforce
[2014-11-13 12:43:01] jimevans: hahahaha
[2014-11-13 12:43:14] barancev: miss!
[2014-11-13 12:43:16] AutomatedTester: bless your cotton socks Alex...
[2014-11-13 12:43:36] nirvdrum: Well, I don't.  But even if that were the case, how in the hell would writing an IE driver fit into the Salesforce corporate model?
[2014-11-13 12:43:55] zergling_: they are partners with sauce labs
[2014-11-13 12:44:08] zergling_: or at least have a partner relationship
[2014-11-13 12:44:22] *AutomatedTester pats Alex on the head... '
[2014-11-13 12:44:38] AutomatedTester: they have at most a B2B relationship
[2014-11-13 12:44:42] nirvdrum: I mean Salesforce, as a leading CRM provider, sells absolutely no form of testing solution that I'm aware of.
[2014-11-13 12:44:42] AutomatedTester: one pays the other money
[2014-11-13 12:45:03] zergling_: heh. why do they advertise as partners
[2014-11-13 12:45:14] zergling_: let me find the link later
[2014-11-13 12:45:20] AutomatedTester: ok...
[2014-11-13 12:45:22] nirvdrum: Find it now.  I'm very interested.
[2014-11-13 12:45:32] nirvdrum: Please don't make this a low priority task.
[2014-11-13 12:45:45] barancev: may be because it is cool to be called a MS partner? :)
[2014-11-13 12:45:48] zergling_: https://saucelabs.com/partners
[2014-11-13 12:45:51] barancev: or SauceLabs partner
[2014-11-13 12:46:08] barancev: or IBM partner
[2014-11-13 12:46:10] zergling_: may have changed since i saw last
[2014-11-13 12:46:12] AutomatedTester: zergling_: no Salesforce there
[2014-11-13 12:46:18] nirvdrum: So, Salesforce doesn't claim to be a SauceLabs partner?
[2014-11-13 12:46:27] AutomatedTester: zergling_: that is for consultants who sell Saucelabs with their services

[2014-11-13 12:46:59] AutomatedTester: zergling_: Salesforce at most would pay Saucelabs for using their infrastructure
[2014-11-13 12:47:08] jimevans: nirvdrum: do it! please! i wanna see that!
[2014-11-13 12:47:12] AutomatedTester: which is Saucelabs business model
[2014-11-13 12:47:39] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 780
[2014-11-13 12:48:20] nirvdrum: zergling_: But, while we're at it, I'm shutting down a startup that sat in this space.  I reckon I lost $40K in personal cash and probably a couple years worth of market rate salary for your so-called corporate open source.
[2014-11-13 12:48:41] barancev: salesforce is not a sauce partner, nirvdrum is not working on salesforce...
[2014-11-13 12:48:49] nirvdrum: So, character accusations aren't going to sit terribly well.
[2014-11-13 12:49:01] barancev: but selenium is a piece of crap, anyway :)
[2014-11-13 12:49:09] nirvdrum: No one owes me anything of course, but that's true all around.
[2014-11-13 12:50:28] barancev: why simonstewart thinks that splitting the server to RC and WebDriver parts is easy? well, may be for Him...
[2014-11-13 12:50:51] jarib: barancev: probably because he merged them :P
[2014-11-13 12:51:16] barancev: jarib: when there were no grid2
[2014-11-13 12:51:31] jarib: right
[2014-11-13 12:51:32] barancev: and no *webdriver launcher
[2014-11-13 12:52:09] barancev: jarib: AutomatedTester: do we need *webdriver launcher? is it implemented in ruby and python?
[2014-11-13 12:52:15] mtscout6, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-13 12:52:21] jarib: i'm not sure what that is
[2014-11-13 12:52:39] AutomatedTester: I have no idea what that is
[2014-11-13 12:52:45] barancev: well...
[2014-11-13 12:52:56] AutomatedTester: it launches webdriver I guess
[2014-11-13 12:53:22] barancev: that was a killer feature developer for non-Java bindings, and you don't know anything! exellent...
[2014-11-13 12:53:35] barancev: *developed
[2014-11-13 12:53:43] jarib: hehe
[2014-11-13 12:54:06] jarib: barancev: if it's any consolation, there's a lot of things i don't know
[2014-11-13 12:54:08] AutomatedTester: barancev: assume if its not in the mailing list declaring it exists then no one has used it
[2014-11-13 12:54:33] AutomatedTester: I have better thing to do that watch commits into the tree
[2014-11-13 12:54:34] barancev: the idea is to start a remote session using RC API, but request the server to use WDBS to drive the browser
[2014-11-13 12:54:41] jarib: aha
[2014-11-13 12:54:47] jimevans: barancev: i know next to nothing, particularly about software development, if certain people are to be believed.
[2014-11-13 12:54:50] AutomatedTester: so I didnt implement wdbs in python
[2014-11-13 12:55:03] AutomatedTester: they had RC and they had webdriver
[2014-11-13 12:55:09] AutomatedTester: pick sides... it's a war
[2014-11-13 12:55:17] jarib: barancev: yes, i do know about that, and it's possible to use from ruby
[2014-11-13 12:55:26] jimevans: yeah, so .net's wdbs implementation doesn't use that.

[2014-11-13 12:56:27] nirvdrum: jarib: That is no consolation :-P
[2014-11-13 12:56:29] barancev: it was developed for those lazy guys who don't want to implement WDBS in python (nothing personal)
[2014-11-13 12:57:08] barancev: did not want. too late to start now
[2014-11-13 12:57:26] AutomatedTester: barancev: s/lazy guys/guys making choices about their libraries and it's userbase/
[2014-11-13 12:57:41] barancev: fair point
[2014-11-13 12:57:54] AutomatedTester: and no one asked for it

[2014-11-13 12:59:13] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I mean no python user wanted it
[2014-11-13 12:59:22] AutomatedTester: and I didnt want to give people a crutch
[2014-11-13 12:59:53] AutomatedTester: Simon added some implementation for wdbs and it never worked
[2014-11-13 13:00:04] AutomatedTester: and I left the bug there waiting to see who would try fix it
[2014-11-13 13:00:23] AutomatedTester: 0 bugs and 0 patches
[2014-11-13 13:00:38] AutomatedTester: and then I removed the code
[2014-11-13 13:01:01] jarib: i have a vague recollection of someone requesting it for ruby actually
[2014-11-13 13:01:02] barancev: now I'm going to remove it form the server
[2014-11-13 13:01:10] barancev: but email first

[2014-11-13 13:05:14] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am that too
[2014-11-13 13:05:27] AutomatedTester: and as lukeis pointed out... I am a sexy sexy beast too
[2014-11-13 13:05:29] barancev: let's remove this feature from the server and wait for bug reports
[2014-11-13 13:05:48] jimevans: AutomatedTester: you are all that, and more. :)
[2014-11-13 13:05:48] nirvdrum: barancev: Any reason not to make that 3.0 thing?
[2014-11-13 13:05:58] lukeis: AutomatedTester: especially with that tease with no top on ;)
[2014-11-13 13:06:17] nirvdrum: While I don't use the feature, I'm not wild about yanking things like that in a point release.  Especially when we constantly jam point releases down users throats just to use a newer browser.
[2014-11-13 13:06:25] AutomatedTester: lukeis: clothing doesnt impact how sexy I am tbqh
[2014-11-13 13:06:30] barancev: nirvdrum: I'm working on 3.0, and that's why I want to remove it
[2014-11-13 13:06:40] nirvdrum: barancev: Ahh!  Well, my bad :-)
[2014-11-13 13:07:15] barancev: but simonstewart wants it be in the code base, so we can build "old"RC-only server too
[2014-11-13 13:07:37] barancev: that's why I'm splitting RC from WebDriver
[2014-11-13 13:07:43] barancev: client was easy
[2014-11-13 13:07:55] barancev: unlike the server
[2014-11-13 13:08:56] barancev: and *webdriver ties RC launchers to WebDriver, no way to split without loosing this feature, or using sort of dynamic loading

[2014-11-13 13:14:54] barancev: no more RC in the main distribution package
[2014-11-13 13:15:03] jarib: but still in the code tree?
[2014-11-13 13:15:16] barancev: yes... :(
[2014-11-13 13:15:19] lukeis: yeah, not removed until 4.0
[2014-11-13 13:16:12] jarib: it's pretty interesting how we merged these two code bases and are now pulling them apart
[2014-11-13 13:16:31] jarib: if you were to look at the ruby gem in isolation, it would look completely insane
[2014-11-13 13:16:52] jarib: i think i'm going to avoid pulling RC out into a separate gem again, just to avoid looking completely insane
[2014-11-13 13:17:26] jarib: if someone wants to maintain/use it, they can do a fork off the last 2.X

[2014-11-13 13:18:09] jimevans: luckily, .net has always had separate assemblies for RC vs. webdriver.
[2014-11-13 13:18:19] barancev: Java client was very easy to split
[2014-11-13 13:18:23] jimevans: 3.0 is largely a non-event for .net.
[2014-11-13 13:19:03] AutomatedTester: jarib: I am thinking of leaving RC where it is
[2014-11-13 13:19:16] AutomatedTester: jarib: it's in a different name space
[2014-11-13 13:19:22] barancev: server itself is easy too (as soon as I'll find a way to overcome *webdriver problem)

[2014-11-13 15:51:22] lukeis: i don't think it does by default
[2014-11-13 15:51:37] lukeis: checkout the -h of the standalone server (will be a lot of info...)

[2014-11-13 16:20:44] jnott: ohhh
[2014-11-13 16:20:52] AutomatedTester: jnott: so .text gets the text for that element, normalises it and removes text it thinks is hidden to the user

[2014-11-13 16:22:58] AutomatedTester: jnott: even if you had <span> I like <div style='display:none'>goats</div> cheese</span> span.text would return "I like cheese"
