[2014-11-07 03:58:54] SitamJana: ok no problem at all
[2014-11-07 03:59:35] SitamJana: I will try to find out solutions on how to
[2014-11-07 03:59:51] SitamJana: Anyways, thanks a lot for the suggestion you made
[2014-11-07 04:00:01] SitamJana: That was very helpful
[2014-11-07 04:00:57] AutomatedTester: SitamJana: the nice thing about doing what I suggest is that if you have the video running slowly or that your test will fail
[2014-11-07 04:01:23] AutomatedTester: that could mean issues in how its being served, the data flow between servers etc
[2014-11-07 04:02:08] SitamJana: Yes thats true
[2014-11-07 04:02:50] AutomatedTester: the downside, but upside for me working at Mozilla, is that you might find browser bugs :D
[2014-11-07 04:03:41] SitamJana: :D
