[2014-11-16 11:04:25] bdonnahue: i've found that the only way to get the page to navigate is to manually enter a url in the firefox instance that pops up. then subsequent programmed navigations will work

[2014-11-16 11:05:39] ato: koddsson: The short answer is no.

[2014-11-16 11:36:48] bdonnahue: webdriver 2.32.1.0
[2014-11-16 11:37:10] bdonnahue: its also the mono package
[2014-11-16 11:37:30] bdonnahue: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver.Mono/
[2014-11-16 11:39:19] ato: koddsson: The longer answer is that you can if you use Marionette, which allows you to go into chrome context.  But it's not fully WebDriver compatible.
[2014-11-16 11:39:45] ato: koddsson: But if you're using WebDriver you will probably want to create a custom profile and send that to FirefoxDriver to use.
[2014-11-16 11:41:45] smccarthy: bdonnahue: ok. I suggest using firefox 33 with webdriver 2.44.0 . I gotta run now tho

[2014-11-16 12:16:21] koddsson: So it only accepts either of those parameters

[2014-11-16 12:29:38] koddsson: I'm confused about how to access the `about:config` properties once I set the context to chrome if you could bear with me ato
[2014-11-16 12:30:30] koddsson: Doesn't seem to be anything that I can see in the python docs which leads me to believe that this is some sort of JS code that should be able to edit the preferences
[2014-11-16 12:30:34] koddsson: (in theory)
[2014-11-16 12:31:15] ato: I don't know much more than you about this (-:
[2014-11-16 12:31:23] ato: So the DOM has a <treechildren> element.
[2014-11-16 12:31:38] ato: Not sure how to interact with that because it doesn't seem to expand.
[2014-11-16 12:32:09] ato: You might want to try #automation on irc.mozilla.org.
[2014-11-16 12:32:27] koddsson: ah ok
[2014-11-16 12:32:33] koddsson: Thanks for all the help :)
[2014-11-16 12:33:51] ato: XUL is a… big pool of interestingness.

[2014-11-16 12:46:56] ato: What were your findings?
[2014-11-16 12:47:16] koddsson: I can change about:config preferences as I please using marionette
[2014-11-16 12:47:36] ato: Ah right, using SpecialPowers.
[2014-11-16 12:47:46] koddsson: I just copied that little test and changed it a bit and watched the `about:config` value change in my firefox browser
[2014-11-16 12:47:52] koddsson: So I'm a happy camper :)
[2014-11-16 12:47:55] ato: Yay
[2014-11-16 12:47:59] ato: Sorry I didn't think of that.

[2014-11-16 16:14:28] cjbayliss: Ah uh! So I don't need a regexp. Presumably because this is python, anything in quotes is treated as is. So instead of "regexp:\\.aaaaaaa\\s\\[Project\\]" have ".aaaaaaa [Project]" and it works fine.
[2014-11-16 16:15:12] cjbayliss: the selenium plugin for Firefox should do that by default.
