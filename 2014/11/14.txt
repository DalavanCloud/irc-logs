[2014-11-14 09:28:33] lukeis: (the python bindings tests that is)
[2014-11-14 09:29:05] dimacus: lukeis: any chance you wanna drop a custom standalone jar into your binding and see how safari behaves on your machine? especially on 10.10?
[2014-11-14 09:29:10] *dimacus currently has a test sample of 1'
[2014-11-14 09:29:45] lukeis: is it just your pull request?
[2014-11-14 09:29:49] lukeis: or do you have other changes?
[2014-11-14 09:30:21] dimacus: just pull request, it consists of splitting the extensions and adding some applescripts to deal with 10.10 non sense
[2014-11-14 09:30:52] lukeis: ./go //py:safari_test:run
[2014-11-14 09:31:23] lukeis: i'd have to see if that uses the standalone or not ;)
[2014-11-14 09:31:25] dimacus: ahhh can i d do ./go //rb:safari_test:run?
[2014-11-14 09:31:27] tony3, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-11-14 09:42:24] lukeis: dimacus: ./go py_prep_for_install_release   and then ./go //py:safari_test:run   ;)  it will ask you to set an environment variable for the standalone jar executable
[2014-11-14 09:42:52] dimacus: ahhhh
[2014-11-14 09:43:14] errant_rider: dimacus after review seems that selenium + firefox is no bueno in Yosemite...
[2014-11-14 09:43:24] jleyba: dimacus: you could try running the node tests against safari. no crazy-fun involved

[2014-11-14 09:44:27] jleyba: oh, i haven't done that for node yet
[2014-11-14 09:44:55] *jleyba seriously burned himself out on safari'

[2014-11-14 09:45:17] dimacus: took me a week just to get the extension to install on Yosemite… that was really pain ful
[2014-11-14 09:45:38] andy_seit: lukeis: Hey Luke, have you heard anything about sauce now using selendroid instead of appium?
[2014-11-14 09:46:03] lukeis: andy_seit: they've always used selendroid
[2014-11-14 09:46:04] jleyba: dimacus: If you really want to have a good time, spend some time on frame handling
[2014-11-14 09:46:09] lukeis: it's bundled inside appium
[2014-11-14 09:46:14] yosito, quitting. ()
[2014-11-14 09:46:19] andy_seit: yeah, but I mean specifically
[2014-11-14 09:46:21] jleyba: 90% of the work on the safaridriver was probably frames
[2014-11-14 09:46:41] andy_seit: because they couldn't get appium to work with Sauce connect
[2014-11-14 09:46:42] lukeis: appium has two android implementations…. UIAutomation based (written in appium) and Instrumenation based (selendroid)
[2014-11-14 09:46:48] dimacus: jleyba: ahh crap
[2014-11-14 09:46:52] dimacus: no thank
[2014-11-14 09:47:01] lukeis: andy_seit: i don't know… i only use selendroid in saucelabs
[2014-11-14 09:47:39] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 782
[2014-11-14 09:47:44] jleyba: lukeis: how does selendroid stack up vs espresso?
[2014-11-14 09:48:03] lukeis: slower… but you know, uses the webdriver api ;) so better? :)
[2014-11-14 09:48:41] andy_seit: so "the latest Selendroid driver has an updated Android driver in it that sets the banner you are seeing." so sauce's "android driver" is selendroid
[2014-11-14 09:49:11] andy_seit: we've been getting a few mixed messages from support over the past few months, we're confusing each other at this point :)
[2014-11-14 09:49:34] lukeis: AndroidDriver is something different...
[2014-11-14 09:49:37] mtscout6: Can someone on the Selenium dev team work with me on getting the elgalu/docker-selenium github repo transferred to Selenium HQ?
[2014-11-14 09:49:40] andy_seit: Thats what I thought
[2014-11-14 09:49:44] andy_seit: hence the confusion
[2014-11-14 09:49:46] lukeis: that's a legacy, deprecated thing which selendroid replaced
[2014-11-14 09:49:54] andy_seit: exactamundo
[2014-11-14 09:50:11] jleyba: AndroidDriver was the very first attempt at webdriver on Android.. it dates back to before froyo
[2014-11-14 09:50:32] andy_seit: yep
[2014-11-14 09:50:33] lukeis: the thing is that UI Automator doesn't support WebViews in lower than API 17… so selendroid is needed for older version support
[2014-11-14 09:51:06] andy_seit: one of my guys was confused because the tests get a bit 'androiddriver' label, that they said selendroid puts there

[2014-11-14 10:01:14] lukeis: MIT
[2014-11-14 10:01:16] lukeis: hmmm
[2014-11-14 10:01:16] mtscout6: Yes, it's MIT
[2014-11-14 10:02:07] lukeis: jleyba: so, do you know if that's compatible? or can we have the license changed?
[2014-11-14 10:02:40] lukeis: (mtscout6 selenium uses Apache 2)

[2014-11-14 10:04:55] jleyba: lukeis: I meant more along the lines of how does SFC feel about us hosting a repo we don't "own"?
[2014-11-14 10:05:12] lukeis: we would own it though?
[2014-11-14 10:05:30] jleyba: oh, then I'm cool with it
[2014-11-14 10:05:43] jleyba: would prefer Apache 2 over MIT, but MIT works too
[2014-11-14 10:05:47] mtscout6: That's the goal here is to transfer ownership to selenium, elgalu and myself are looking to help maintain it as well
[2014-11-14 10:06:12] mtscout6: elgalu is fine with changing to apache. I'll get to that today.
[2014-11-14 10:06:23] jleyba: mtscout6: was this done for your employer / could you employer claim ownership?
[2014-11-14 10:06:52] mtscout6: Also, looks like selenium has already been grabbed up on dockerhub has someone here claimed that
[2014-11-14 10:07:05] jleyba: hate when that happens :)
[2014-11-14 10:07:13] mtscout6: jleyba: I think we'd see more community support on this if it was under the selenium umbrella
[2014-11-14 10:07:38] mtscout6: I can create a support ticket with them and cc the dev mailing list if you like
[2014-11-14 10:07:47] lukeis: mtscout6: nope…. the name is often grabbed without consulting us :(
[2014-11-14 10:07:48] mtscout6: That user has not pushed any repos
[2014-11-14 10:07:51] jleyba: mtscout6: not refuting that. was asking if you have th authority to transfer ownership to Selenium
[2014-11-14 10:08:28] jleyba: lukeis: we're "selenium-webdriver" on npm b/c "selenium" and "webdriver" were already taken :(
[2014-11-14 10:08:36] mtscout6: elgalu is the one with ownership, he will be the one actually doing it. I'm just coordinating for him. I'm planning to tell him when you've given the green light

[2014-11-14 10:09:18] lukeis: so i think jleyba's last question is the last barrier
[2014-11-14 10:10:22] mtscout6: What exactly are you asking
[2014-11-14 10:11:44] jleyba: do you/elgalu have authority to xfer ownership to Selenium, or do you need to do a code grant to SFC via your employer
[2014-11-14 10:11:55] lukeis: do you have the right to grant the code to "Software Freedom Conservancy" without your companies suing us :)
[2014-11-14 10:12:06] jleyba: ^ he said it better
[2014-11-14 10:12:58] mtscout6: I do, I'll check with elgalu one second
