[2014-11-20 01:01:59] neuronnet: when the res goes down...the ids on the webpage change

[2014-11-20 01:37:08] WhereIsMySpoon: neuronnet: ah i see, when there is not enough space your site automatically moves it into a menu
[2014-11-20 01:37:21] WhereIsMySpoon: neuronnet: then you need to make sure you just always start the browser with the same resolution
[2014-11-20 01:37:21] neuronnet: yes
[2014-11-20 01:37:53] neuronnet: hmm..but is that the only way
[2014-11-20 01:37:55] neuronnet: !!
[2014-11-20 01:39:33] WhereIsMySpoon: neuronnet: I can't see any other way to resolve this other than doing some check before hand to see if the element is outside the menu or not
[2014-11-20 01:39:39] WhereIsMySpoon: which is generally not what you want in selenium tests
[2014-11-20 01:39:47] WhereIsMySpoon: they should have one execution path

[2014-11-20 02:46:03] Joe____: Hi, guys! I'm using selenium webdriver. Please, help me. I need to know is element present or not. I'm verify value of vareible "iselementpresent" in this code: Boolean iselementpresent = driver.findElements(By.xpath("div[class^='serp-block serp-']>div>div:nth-of-type(2)>div>div>div")).size()!= 0; It works fine if this path is exist, but when not- selenium shown me error message. How I can check, is this path exist or not?
[2014-11-20 02:49:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: what error message?
[2014-11-20 02:50:16] Joe____: this: ноя 20, 2014 5:35:46 PM org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog destroyHarder INFO: Command failed to close cleanly. Destroying forcefully (v2). org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog@247d8ae
[2014-11-20 02:50:31] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: can you please :gist the whole stack trace
[2014-11-20 02:50:31] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[2014-11-20 02:51:49] Joe____: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/54f1f29cd5bc37990faa
[2014-11-20 02:52:09] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: I mean the error stack trace
[2014-11-20 02:52:16] WhereIsMySpoon: the whole stack trace, in a gist
[2014-11-20 02:53:10] Joe____: Try to do this.
[2014-11-20 02:53:56] Joe____: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b302b339ca3f6c39680f
[2014-11-20 02:55:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: and you're saying this doesnt error when the element exists?
[2014-11-20 02:55:51] WhereIsMySpoon: because that error message is saying your xpath is invalid
[2014-11-20 02:56:14] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: I think you're mixing up CSS selectors and xpath, nth-of-type is css
[2014-11-20 02:56:33] WhereIsMySpoon: [class=... should be [@class=...
[2014-11-20 02:56:38] Joe____: Yes, I know that my path is invalid. And I wanted to know how I can ferify this path.
[2014-11-20 02:56:39] WhereIsMySpoon: > is css
[2014-11-20 02:57:29] Joe____: I wrote [class... with out @, because I using prefix.
[2014-11-20 02:57:30] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: first of all, id suggest that the xpath/css you're trying to construct is very flaky and prone to failing as it has a long chain
[2014-11-20 02:57:37] WhereIsMySpoon: is there not an id you can use?
[2014-11-20 02:57:47] WhereIsMySpoon: or a class/id/name closer to the element you want to reference
[2014-11-20 02:58:44] WhereIsMySpoon: the first step I'd take is really to take a good look and see if I really need such a long selector
[2014-11-20 02:58:57] Joe____: I checks the links in search result of www.yandex.ru. Every time ID's has differents values.
[2014-11-20 02:59:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: what is "class^="
[2014-11-20 02:59:57] WhereIsMySpoon: what does the ^= mean
[2014-11-20 03:00:26] Joe____: This is field on the page where shown search results.
[2014-11-20 03:00:34] WhereIsMySpoon: yes but what does "^=" mean
[2014-11-20 03:02:11] WhereIsMySpoon: driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("div .serp-block .serp- > div > div:nth-of-type(2) > div > div > div"))
[2014-11-20 03:02:15] Joe____: This in mean that I have everi time changing name of class. First part of this class has string like this:"serp-block serp-". After dash it every time changing. It is like patern.
[2014-11-20 03:02:24] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-11-20 03:02:28] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case ignore my selector
[2014-11-20 03:02:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i need to go now sorry
[2014-11-20 03:02:45] Joe____: ok
[2014-11-20 03:02:53] WhereIsMySpoon: will try help later if someone else hasnt
[2014-11-20 03:03:06] Joe____: will hope
[2014-11-20 03:03:07] WhereIsMySpoon: but pls try take a closer look at the html and see if there is shorter selector you can use, if not dont worry
[2014-11-20 03:04:21] Joe____: I just to need to check the selector. Is this selector exist or not. I can't way how to check this.

[2014-11-20 10:05:34] jleyba: You're not passing any arguments to that function
[2014-11-20 10:06:08] Lope: of course I am. Perhaps you're not familiar with how webdriverJS works?
[2014-11-20 10:06:41] jleyba: Pretty sure I'm familiar with it :-)

[2014-11-20 10:07:24] Lope: so my last test shows that the function gets converted to a string.
[2014-11-20 10:07:26] jleyba: ah I misread your snippet

[2014-11-20 10:09:02] Lope: so the function gets converted to a string. I guess I could eval it inside the function.

[2014-11-20 10:13:36] Lope: jleyba: IIRC you helped me once before with a webdriverJS question and people said you've done some development work on webdriverJS?
[2014-11-20 10:13:47] jleyba: I wrote it
[2014-11-20 10:13:55] Lope: oh, cool. Thank you :)))
[2014-11-20 10:14:31] Lope: It's a little rudimentary, but after extending it, it's been very useful for me.
[2014-11-20 10:15:41] Lope: so, is that a bug that it converts functions to strings?
[2014-11-20 10:16:14] Lope: I figure they probably need to get converted to strings to get into the browser, but then surely they should be converted back to functions again?

[2014-11-20 10:16:58] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-20 10:17:33] jleyba: So your script argument is {name: 'bob', f: function() {}}
[2014-11-20 10:17:58] Lope: well, not an empty function, but approximately yes.
[2014-11-20 10:18:19] jleyba: Yeah, it's expected that the function gets stringified
[2014-11-20 10:18:42] Lope: it's just a simple example demonstrating the use of a function as a parameter.
[2014-11-20 10:19:05] jleyba: WebDriver doesn't recognize functions as arguments to executeScript/executeAsyncScript
[2014-11-20 10:20:03] Lope: all good.
[2014-11-20 10:20:25] Lope: are you still developing it or just fixing bugs?
[2014-11-20 10:20:51] jleyba: Could probably change WebDriverJS to transform it on the client, but not sure that's worth the complexity
[2014-11-20 10:22:30] Lope: well I would have expected it to happen. the other thing is console.log doesn't work inside the async function. So what I normally do is make a log string array, and push my log stuff into the array. then pass the array back to node.js in the return hash.
[2014-11-20 10:22:31] jleyba: Still working on it when I have time. Focused on native node support to break the dependency on the standalone selenium server.
[2014-11-20 10:22:55] jleyba: console.log doesn't work inside the async function? It should... it just goes to the browser's console not yours :)
[2014-11-20 10:23:15] Lope: jleyba: haha, yeah I'm sure :)

[2014-11-20 10:23:56] Lope: Oh, that's cool. I started off using chromium's builtin driver. then I needed to switch to FF recently.
[2014-11-20 10:24:07] Lope: so, using the jar, of course.
[2014-11-20 10:24:23] jleyba: 2.44.0 supports FF and Chrome natively in node
[2014-11-20 10:24:30] jleyba: jar is only needed for IE and Safari
[2014-11-20 10:24:49] Lope: you mean webdriverJS 2.44.0? is it stable?

[2014-11-20 10:26:33] Lope: awesome :)
[2014-11-20 10:27:19] Lope: is there any way I can speed this up? I'm opening a static page on my hard drive, which opens almost instantly, but then this takes like 15 seconds to return...

[2014-11-20 11:07:55] Lope: what's wrong with it? seems to work okay?
[2014-11-20 11:08:01] jleyba: Lope: on the Selenium project? me
[2014-11-20 11:08:17] jleyba: the angular folks working on protractor help out when they hit issues
[2014-11-20 11:08:40] Lope: is there any way I can speed this up? I'm opening a static page on my hard drive, which opens almost instantly, but then this takes like 15 seconds to return... (using selenium server JAR with webdriverJS driver.get('/tmp/blah'); driver.findElement({id:'result'}).getInnerHtml().then(function(result){console.log('got result: '+result);});
[2014-11-20 11:09:01] jleyba: which part is slow?
[2014-11-20 11:09:24] jleyba: the initial load, findElement, or inner html?

[2014-11-20 11:10:58] Lope: Oh, I'm not sure exactly which part is slow, I'll put in some more console.logs and see.
[2014-11-20 11:11:21] Lope: I've noticed that when I run async functions I can only pass 1 parameter in, and get 1 parameter out? so I tend to just pass a hash.
[2014-11-20 11:12:31] jleyba: Should be able to pass in arbitrary number of arguments. Callback is always given as the last one (arguments[arguments.length - 1])
[2014-11-20 11:12:36] jleyba: but yes, it only accepts a single response value
[2014-11-20 11:16:48] Lope: jleyba: it was actually running slow all day, but speeded itself up in the evening somehow. (i didn't change any of the code)
[2014-11-20 11:17:40] Lope: oh, yes. I remember. that's right.

[2014-11-20 11:35:55] HenrikB: I was on yesterday asking for help in connecting two vm's - ubuntu vm holding the selenium hub, and a windows server holding the selenium node. all under virtual box. It turns out that both boxes have an ip address of 10.0.2.15 assigned by virtualbox. that could be the problem :-)

[2014-11-20 15:19:27] mheinke, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-20 15:20:54] mheinke: i need to be able to run a standalone selenium server silently (ie doesnt take over the bash console) ive tried java -jar selenium-standalone-version.jar &    ...but that doesnt actually seem to work (ubuntu 12.04 server)
[2014-11-20 15:21:47] mheinke: like i cant seem to run java -jar selenium.jar & bin/behat and have it actually execute both
[2014-11-20 15:23:30] sgsabbage: tbh, I use start-stop-daemon for that. E.g.
[2014-11-20 15:23:54] sgsabbage: start-stop-daemon -b -a /usr/bin/java -m -p /path/to/pidfile -S -- -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone.jar
[2014-11-20 15:24:15] mheinke: sgsabbage: thats something i would have to create?
[2014-11-20 15:24:30] sgsabbage: which bit?
[2014-11-20 15:24:31] Silne30, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-20 15:24:44] sgsabbage: start-stop-daemon is pretty standard on most linux systems
[2014-11-20 15:24:52] mheinke: an actual daemon like /etc/rc.d/init.d/selenium ....
[2014-11-20 15:24:56] sgsabbage: nope
[2014-11-20 15:25:20] mheinke: interesting (still learning about internals...mostly just a java/php dev)
[2014-11-20 15:25:55] sgsabbage: most rc.d scripts actually just run start-stop-daemon
[2014-11-20 15:26:46] sgsabbage: -b is background -a is process to run, -m is make pidfile if it doesn't exist, -p is the path to the pid, -S means 'start this process' and then everything after the -- is just arguments to java
[2014-11-20 15:26:59] mheinke: interesting, i have some research todo :) thanks!!!!
[2014-11-20 15:27:06] mheinke: sgsabbage++
[2014-11-20 15:27:16] sgsabbage: then to stop it (if you need to) you can run: start-stop-daemon -a /usr/bin/java -p /path/to/slave.pid -K
[2014-11-20 15:27:21] sgsabbage: no problem at all
[2014-11-20 15:27:41] sgsabbage: Others may have different suggestions, but it works for me ;)
[2014-11-20 15:28:39] mheinke: anything that works at this point, will make me happy :) i was trying to do threaded processess..and it wasnt working
[2014-11-20 15:28:57] mheinke: and when im running this from cron..it needs to be stable and work 100%
[2014-11-20 15:29:20] sgsabbage: running it from cron? What's the use case?
[2014-11-20 15:29:29] sgsabbage: as in, building every x period?

[2014-11-20 15:30:40] mheinke: sgsabbage: yea we have generic tests that we want to run every 30 minutes. to confirm that everything is happy in the application
[2014-11-20 15:30:54] mheinke: then we have user acceptance tests that are run by a user
[2014-11-20 15:31:26] mheinke: i have 5 tests that are basicly considered part of application monitoring.
[2014-11-20 15:31:28] sgsabbage: gotcha. Depending on how you do it, you may just want to start selenium on server boot and leave it running the whole time, rather than starting it and stopping it every 30 minutes
[2014-11-20 15:32:42] mheinke: sgsabbage: i wasnt sure about that. i was wondering about resources and consumption...would it be more efficent just to start selenium on boot? or start and destroy?
[2014-11-20 15:34:12] sgsabbage: honestly, you can do either - just be aware that it takes up to around 30 seconds to start selenium and have the port open and thus if you run behat straight after you've started it it may fail to connect, so you might need to handle that along the line somewhere
