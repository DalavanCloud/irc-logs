[2014-11-24 09:37:02] WhereIsMySpoon: yea it should be WebDriver webDriver = new Augmenter().augment(((BaseHelper)currentClass).getDriver());
[2014-11-24 09:37:16] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-11-24 09:38:43] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: what the heck is BaseHelper
[2014-11-24 09:39:33] WhereIsMySpoon: oh its below
[2014-11-24 09:39:46] WhereIsMySpoon: ew what the heck
[2014-11-24 09:40:10] Aditya: BaseHelper is th class which ll return the instance of firefox driver , yes I have pasted the code in comments
[2014-11-24 09:40:18] sircapsalot: Aditya, did you reearch the ClassCastException? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/907360/can-someone-explain-classcastexception-in-java
[2014-11-24 09:40:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: you have some really messed up code
[2014-11-24 09:40:35] sircapsalot: ^
[2014-11-24 09:41:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: let me explain your logic. You have a ITestResult. You then get the instance of this, try to cast it to your random wrapper class BaseHelper, then expect to be able to call getDriver
[2014-11-24 09:41:29] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: why do you think casting an ITestResult  to a BaseHelper will work
[2014-11-24 09:41:44] losh, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-11-24 09:41:45] WhereIsMySpoon: BaseHelper has no relation to it
[2014-11-24 09:42:24] WhereIsMySpoon: this is not a selenium problem, this is a not understanding how classes and hierarchy/casting works in java problem
[2014-11-24 09:42:44] Aditya: Since BaseHelper has the getDriver() method
[2014-11-24 09:43:03] sburjan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-24 09:43:18] Dave_B_: getDriver() doesn't get your driver instance, it makes a new one
[2014-11-24 09:43:47] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-24 09:44:13] Dave_B_: though that's kinda beside the point
[2014-11-24 09:44:25] Aditya: So Dave_B if it creates a new driver instance then I should be getting a blank window open up
[2014-11-24 09:44:39] Aditya: but I am getting exception
[2014-11-24 09:44:46] Dave_B_: well before you even try to make that metyhod call your class cast blows up
[2014-11-24 09:45:01] Dave_B_: to borrow from WhereIsMySpoon - this is not a selenium problem, this is a not understanding how classes and hierarchy/casting works in java problem
[2014-11-24 09:45:39] WhereIsMySpoon: lol wtf
[2014-11-24 09:46:44] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: the issue is youre trying to cast your ITestResult  to a BaseHelper class
[2014-11-24 09:46:50] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt get past that
[2014-11-24 09:46:50] Aditya: Can any one of you WhereIsMySpoon or Dave_B can help in resolving the issue
[2014-11-24 09:46:56] WhereIsMySpoon: i need to go now
[2014-11-24 09:47:12] WhereIsMySpoon: Aditya: not really, you need to explain why you're doing (BaseHelper) currentClass
[2014-11-24 09:47:15] sircapsalot: you can always write a question on :stackoverflow
[2014-11-24 09:47:33] WhereIsMySpoon: why are you casting ITestResult to BaseHelper

[2014-11-24 09:52:51] Dave_B_: also, you'll still need to fix your getDriver() method to actually return an existing driver, not make a new one then return it (see the SO answer you linked for a suggested way).

[2014-11-24 20:29:07] Makavelic9323: I keep getting a java null point exception when using appium with junit on my second @test. On the second test I can no longer use driver. I setup the driver in a base class which is extended by the test class. I have a @beforeClass method that calls the setUp() method of the baseclass. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
