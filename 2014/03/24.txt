[2014-03-24 07:34:55] simonstewart: OK
[2014-03-24 07:35:51] nirvdrum: The basic problem is RWD can create a browser, but fail somewhere along the line (socket error maybe) and then the browser just gets orphaned.
[2014-03-24 07:36:05] simonstewart: That’s suboptimal
[2014-03-24 07:36:13] nirvdrum: Really, we probably shouldn't do all this in a constructor, since there's not a great way to clean it up.

[2014-03-24 10:39:03] barancev: but first I have a new idea :)
[2014-03-24 10:39:16] simonstewart: :)
[2014-03-24 10:39:40] barancev: simonstewart: let's implement a new read-only capability that contains information about supported protocol versions
[2014-03-24 10:40:14] simonstewart: Be careful
[2014-03-24 10:40:15] dogarrhea: An expectation for checking that an element is either invisible or not present on the DOM. using the word to define itself is really really annoying
[2014-03-24 10:40:21] dogarrhea: what does this mean in this context?
[2014-03-24 10:40:25] dogarrhea: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html#invisibilityOfElementLocated%28org.openqa.selenium.By%29
[2014-03-24 10:40:40] simonstewart: not found || not displayed
[2014-03-24 10:40:46] ato: Oh wow, new CEO.
[2014-03-24 10:41:32] barancev: simonstewart: so RemoteWebDriver checks the capabilities and chooses what protocol to use
[2014-03-24 10:41:47] simonstewart: What changes are you worried about?
[2014-03-24 10:42:49] dogarrhea: "not displayed" meaning display:none?
[2014-03-24 10:43:11] dogarrhea: not found is still ambiguous
[2014-03-24 10:43:11] simonstewart: As in “element.isDisplayed() == false"
[2014-03-24 10:43:20] barancev: RemoteWebDriver (or HttpCommandExector to be precise) should decide what request format to be sent
[2014-03-24 10:43:24] simonstewart: driver.findElements(locator) == []
[2014-03-24 10:43:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 761
[2014-03-24 10:43:38] dogarrhea: ok.
[2014-03-24 10:43:45] dogarrhea: we'll stop using this method and find another way as this is ridiculous

[2014-03-24 10:45:46] simonstewart: Changes are:
[2014-03-24 10:45:56] simonstewart: 1) sessionid being a string rather than an object
[2014-03-24 10:46:02] simonstewart: 2) command name being sent
[2014-03-24 10:46:03] Dave_B_: dogarrhea:  why not make a reproducible test case and log a bug?
[2014-03-24 10:46:23] dogarrhea: Dave_B_: there is isdisplayed and invisibility of
[2014-03-24 10:46:39] dogarrhea: two distinct concepts imho
[2014-03-24 10:46:51] barancev: simonstewart: yes, exactly

[2014-03-24 10:47:30] simonstewart: 2 should be a doddle to add now
[2014-03-24 10:47:36] simonstewart: doddle == very easy
[2014-03-24 10:48:00] Dave_B_: dogarrhea:  seem like the inverse of each other to me but then I've not thought about it carefully.
[2014-03-24 10:48:01] barancev: 1 is too, after your change of sessionId deserialization
[2014-03-24 10:48:59] barancev: 3) payload is under "parameters" key

[2014-03-24 10:51:42] ato: simonstewart: I can't find any reference of it in the minutes, but didn't we decide to fix the genitive-s in takeScreenshot and takesElementScreenshot?
[2014-03-24 10:52:10] simonstewart: ?
[2014-03-24 10:52:15] ato: take vs takes
[2014-03-24 10:52:21] simonstewart: barancev: yeah, that’s what I’m thinking
[2014-03-24 10:52:30] simonstewart: Mash the two formats together.
[2014-03-24 10:52:43] simonstewart: Older servers will pick out the bits that they need. Newer ones will be happy.

[2014-03-24 11:09:38] jconsol: one at time
[2014-03-24 11:09:48] jconsol: dont rush to answer
[2014-03-24 11:09:49] jleyba: selenium 3.0 is several months out
[2014-03-24 11:09:59] jleyba: go ahead and use appium or selendroid
[2014-03-24 11:10:28] jconsol: yes, I developed an framework for mobile testing based on them
[2014-03-24 11:10:30] lukeis: selendroid will be compliant with 3.0

[2014-03-24 11:17:36] jconsol: I prefered to do not use appium selendroid, and use selendoid instead
[2014-03-24 11:17:42] lukeis: and yes, they never cared about multiple running at a time… their intention is for you to use saucelabs ;)

[2014-03-24 11:18:27] jconsol: because I have told before

[2014-03-24 11:20:28] jconsol: and that could be achieved
[2014-03-24 11:20:31] jconsol: as selendroid supports it
[2014-03-24 11:20:34] lukeis: i use saucelabs for work and even use saucelabs for android / selendroid integration
[2014-03-24 11:21:20] lukeis: but I do everything in selendroid locally and even have our developers test with just selendroid

[2014-03-24 12:59:23] nirvdrum: barancev: Remind me, please.  Why did you disable console logging on grid if file logging is enabled?
[2014-03-24 13:00:19] barancev: nirvdrum: it is a common use case (sending log to a file instead of the console)
[2014-03-24 13:00:30] barancev: do you want two separate options?
[2014-03-24 13:00:46] barancev: 1) logToFile 2) consoleOff
[2014-03-24 13:00:55] nirvdrum: I want things to match Selenium Server as closely as possible, since we keep telling people that they're virtually the same thing.
[2014-03-24 13:01:15] AutomatedTester: ato: jimevans landed
[2014-03-24 13:01:15] nirvdrum: It's a bit more nuanced than that, too.
[2014-03-24 13:01:25] nirvdrum: I don't log to file.  I log to network.  But the console is also disabled.
[2014-03-24 13:02:00] barancev: nirvdrum: you can change it the way you like
[2014-03-24 13:02:22] barancev: just be careful with memory leaks :)
[2014-03-24 13:02:23] nirvdrum: Yeah, I'll take a look.  I couldn't recall if it was performance related or not.
[2014-03-24 13:02:38] nirvdrum: I spent all day Saturday trying to find memory leaks in the logger and couldn't.
[2014-03-24 13:02:39] barancev: they were the reason to sort out the logs
[2014-03-24 13:03:19] nirvdrum: With the exception that profiler logs never seem to rotate in memory.
[2014-03-24 13:03:31] nirvdrum: But they're cleared when the session is quit.
[2014-03-24 13:04:00] barancev: on session quit is too late
[2014-03-24 13:04:22] barancev: or not?
[2014-03-24 13:04:26] nirvdrum: Your fix doesn't do anything for profiler logs anyway.  They're not handled through the logging system.
[2014-03-24 13:04:33] nirvdrum: They're stored in a local HashMap.

[2014-03-24 13:06:27] nirvdrum: Log entries would accumulate, certainly, but they'd clean up with GC too.
