[2014-03-31 13:19:08] dogarrhea: it looks like running parallel tests from gradle is out of the question.  This feature is only available 1.10 and above and we are 1.6 (older version) and upgrading breaks things
[2014-03-31 13:19:25] simonstewart: jleyba: ‘sup?
[2014-03-31 13:19:26] dogarrhea: what else do I have..
[2014-03-31 13:19:50] jleyba: re: the Augmenter
[2014-03-31 13:20:03] jleyba: how do you feel about it returning a pure interface proxy?
[2014-03-31 13:20:18] simonstewart: It did that originally
[2014-03-31 13:20:27] jleyba: that is: WebDriver augmented = new Augmenter().augment(remoteWebDriverInstance);
[2014-03-31 13:20:35] simonstewart: But it choked on relfexive calls to methods on different implemented interfaces
[2014-03-31 13:20:36] jleyba: right now, augmented instanceof RemoteWebDriver === true
[2014-03-31 13:21:06] jleyba: I'm suggesting breaking that and having the returned value only be instanceof interfaces
[2014-03-31 13:21:07] simonstewart: Notably (from memory) implementing “findsByX” became tricky
[2014-03-31 13:21:31] simonstewart: jleyba: I understand that would be the implication of using the straight java dynamic proxies
[2014-03-31 13:21:36] simonstewart: What’s the motivation?

[2014-03-31 13:22:46] simonstewart: Which appears to solve the major problem caused by us doing much work in constructors
[2014-03-31 13:22:47] jleyba: new Augmenter().augment(chromeDriverInstance) == null
[2014-03-31 13:23:15] simonstewart: Hmmm… should probably detonate in a meaningful way
[2014-03-31 13:23:30] jleyba: Right...but what if you have a specialized version of RemoteWebDriver, which is still really just a RemoteWebDriver that should be safe to augment
[2014-03-31 13:23:30] simonstewart: Or resuce the CommandExecutor and instantiate a new RemoteWebDriver with that.
[2014-03-31 13:23:35] jleyba: say, a ManagedRemoteWebDriver :)
[2014-03-31 13:23:56] simonstewart: Move the check into a protected helper method and override it?
[2014-03-31 13:24:18] jleyba: Seems ugly
[2014-03-31 13:24:47] simonstewart: To be fair, dynamically smooshing a bunch of interfaces on a hapless Object isn’t particularly attractive
[2014-03-31 13:25:15] jleyba: UnsupportedOperationException to the rescue!
[2014-03-31 13:25:25] jleyba: (only slightly kidding)
[2014-03-31 13:25:37] *simonstewart weeps'
[2014-03-31 13:26:52] jleyba: would it be possible for RemoteWebDriver to automatically augment itself?
[2014-03-31 13:27:26] jleyba: stupid question
[2014-03-31 13:27:52] simonstewart: Good. Good.

[2014-03-31 13:28:18] simonstewart: If it helps, I went through a lot of these contortions when I wrote Augmenter in the first place
[2014-03-31 13:28:22] jleyba: ok, so I see three options
[2014-03-31 13:28:25] simonstewart: :)
[2014-03-31 13:28:47] ato: jleyba: Yeah, let's hope it doesn't clash with our India trip.
[2014-03-31 13:28:48] ato: (-:
[2014-03-31 13:29:00] jleyba: ato: I'm not going to SeConf, so no conflict for me :)
[2014-03-31 13:29:16] jleyba: 1) Switch to pure java proxies and force users to code against the interfaces (everything would delegate to the original RWD)
[2014-03-31 13:29:25] ato: jleyba: OK.
[2014-03-31 13:29:35] jleyba: 2) Move the "is this actually a RWD" check into a protected method we could override (ick)
[2014-03-31 13:30:04] simonstewart: 1) Will upset a lot of people: I’ve seen waaaay too much code which uses RWD instead of WD.
[2014-03-31 13:30:07] jleyba: 3) Introduce yet another role interface, Augmentable, and have the Augmenter only support classes that directly implement that
[2014-03-31 13:30:08] simonstewart: 2) Workable
[2014-03-31 13:30:19] simonstewart: 3) Also workable.
[2014-03-31 13:30:26] simonstewart: Though I’d use an annotation
[2014-03-31 13:30:29] *lukeis uses option 4) have our own Class that extends RWD and implements all the interfaces'
[2014-03-31 13:30:47] simonstewart: Of the options (ignoring 4), 2 or 3 are both fine by me
[2014-03-31 13:30:48] jimevans: option 4. otherwise known as the .NET option.
[2014-03-31 13:30:58] lukeis: and python ;)
[2014-03-31 13:31:06] AutomatedTester: and ruby
[2014-03-31 13:31:10] jleyba: Hmm, annotation seems better than YARI
[2014-03-31 13:31:10] lukeis: not really
[2014-03-31 13:31:20] lukeis: ruby does something special with the capabilities returned
[2014-03-31 13:31:44] lukeis: why we had issues with ios-driver & ruby initially (didn't report back that it could execute javascript)
[2014-03-31 13:31:47] jimevans: lukeis: to be fair, so does our special subclass.
