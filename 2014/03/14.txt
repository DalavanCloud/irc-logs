[2014-03-14 03:54:18] ato: There's also implicit waiting which is a little bit more fuzzy, so a lot of people don't recommend it.

Are those more functional conditions possible in dotnet (so worth us implementing) or is there some kind of issue with dotnet that means they aren't feasible?

[2014-03-14 08:31:25] jimevans: To answer your question about the .NET expected conditions class, it only has a few methods because the .NET lambda syntax is nearly ubiquitous and understood by the vast majority of .NET developers.

[2014-03-14 08:33:13] andy_seit: I always felt a tiny bit guilty when using lambdas for waits, like Im over complicating the code for our tester because I've been too lazy to look into it properly
[2014-03-14 08:33:20] jimevans: I get the impression that lambdas aren't as ubiquitous in other languages. In particular, Java is problematic for an elegant syntax (at least for Java 7 and below)

[2014-03-14 08:35:25] jimevans: But the reality is that you can just hide it behind a utility method.
[2014-03-14 08:35:49] andy_seit: Yeah thats what I was thinking, the java's right there if I need it
[2014-03-14 08:35:57] jimevans: That way consumers can ignore the complexity if they want to
[2014-03-14 08:36:15] jimevans: Even though that complexity is often important to understand.
[2014-03-14 08:37:35] jimevans: I honestly wish I'd not implemented anything in the .NET ExpectedConditions

[2014-03-14 08:44:56] jimevans: It'd be ridiculously easy to implement your own ExpectedConditions class in .NET. it's just a static class where the methods return a Func<IWebDriver, bool> or a Func<IWebDriver, object>
[2014-03-14 08:47:47] andy_seit: Yeah
[2014-03-14 08:48:26] andy_seit: I can always make it a training exercise for them if they hate lambdas that much. Muahahaha
[2014-03-14 08:50:16] jimevans: Honestly, lambdas have become so common in .NET code that it's nearly become a requirement to read and understand a code base of any significance.
[2014-03-14 08:51:07] jimevans: Almost as prevalent as generics have become.

[2014-03-14 23:40:35] Nahjil: I'm attempting to get selenium set up on my local machine to run in xvfb so that the GUI won't steal focus and I can work while they are running. I use intellij idea to run the test suite that I inherited. Does anyone know how to set up the run configuration to accomplish this?
