[2014-03-25 06:12:28] nirvdrum: Gotcha.  Then yeah, we'll have to update.  But kinda need the new server in the codebase before we can migrate to it :-P

[2014-03-25 06:22:21] barancev: 1) we don't need RC server in 3.0, it should be prepared to euthanasia, 2) we can't update servlet-api to version 3 because it is incompatible with jetty 5
[2014-03-25 06:22:37] barancev: 2) is most important for me
[2014-03-25 06:23:23] barancev: because without servlet-api 3 we can't support httpOnly flag in cookies
[2014-03-25 06:23:31] barancev: in our tests

[2014-03-25 06:27:14] freynaud___: we have RC protocol support, but it doesn't have a dependency on the code itself afaik

[2014-03-25 09:06:56] qwertyface: AutomatedTester: (fwiw, our use case is using real browsers in performance tests, quitting and restarting browsers frequently puts a lot of load on the VMs which run the browsers, so clearing the cache after each journey is a good workaround).

[2014-03-25 11:47:35] jimevans: now i understand.
[2014-03-25 11:47:48] nirvdrum: Basically, I think he and others figure if the browser is big enough to hold the canvas, that shouldn't require a resize.  But that breaks the semantics of capturing the canvas if it's just white browser background.
[2014-03-25 11:48:12] nirvdrum: E.g., if the max-width is 800px and the browser is sized to 1000px, you have 200px of the browser just drawing its default background.

[2014-03-25 20:35:56] camcam: is anyone here? I've been trying to get Selenium working on my server for 1.5 days now, and I can't manage. There's something fundamental happening that's preventing simple use.
[2014-03-25 20:36:03] camcam: it works fine on my desktop
[2014-03-25 20:36:32] camcam: http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?5c0379eef9562d63#pAV6Bxsj9TA26u2VbfmSijCV/Xm3KPfr7o0JfMNJA78=
[2014-03-25 20:37:34] camcam: If i specify the binary path I get a second error: No Permissions
[2014-03-25 20:37:50] camcam: if I chmod +x the firefox_binary.py file I then get a third error: No shell
[2014-03-25 20:38:20] camcam: if I add //#!bin/sh or whatever to the top of that file to set the 'default shell' I get a fourth error...
[2014-03-25 20:38:27] dude-x: you are running as root
[2014-03-25 20:38:29] dude-x: why?
[2014-03-25 20:38:40] camcam: do you think not running as root will fix this?
[2014-03-25 20:38:43] camcam: because its my server and idk
[2014-03-25 20:38:49] camcam: it costs 40$
[2014-03-25 20:39:00] dude-x: do you have firefox installed on the server?

[2014-03-25 20:39:15] dude-x: do you have xvfb or x windows running?
[2014-03-25 20:39:18] camcam: well yeah it comes with selenium
[2014-03-25 20:39:26] dude-x: firefox is a separate install
[2014-03-25 20:39:40] dude-x: and firefox will not be happy without a GUI
[2014-03-25 20:40:07] dude-x: selenium is just the python code and the bits that talk to the browser
[2014-03-25 20:40:30] camcam: is there a way to test to see if i have a GUI/window system running before i install xvfb? Because i did get PhantomJS working and was able to take screenshots. is it possible to screenshot using phantomjs if u don't have a windows system?
[2014-03-25 20:40:37] camcam: Server is ubuntu 12 btw

[2014-03-25 20:41:09] camcam: Thank you for your help
[2014-03-25 20:42:18] camcam: I'll install xvfb
[2014-03-25 20:43:25] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 765
[2014-03-25 20:44:41] camcam: xdpyinfo -display :0 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "In use" || echo "Free"         outputs      ...  "FREE"
[2014-03-25 20:44:46] camcam: xvfb is installed
[2014-03-25 20:46:12] camcam: Ahh this looks promising, so perhaps the phantomjs worked because it's purely headless but the other ones are failing because i dont have a window system / the executables

[2014-03-25 21:01:37] camcam: Xvfb is running. I did apt-get install firefox. Then tried again and got a 'No display specified' error. Simple enough. Fixed that with 'export DISPLAY=:1'. Xvfb is running on screen 1
[2014-03-25 21:01:46] camcam: Now when I do 'b = webdriver.Firefox()' it just hangs forever.

[2014-03-25 21:10:48] dude-x: type: which firefox
[2014-03-25 21:11:03] dude-x: i remember that sometimes i would tweak the shell file in firefox
[2014-03-25 21:11:09] dude-x: but that's probably not necessary
[2014-03-25 21:11:18] dude-x: the latest firefox now is 27/28

[2014-03-25 21:15:51] camcam: I had to also use xvfbwrapper
[2014-03-25 21:15:53] camcam: not sure why
[2014-03-25 21:15:55] camcam: I'll look into that
