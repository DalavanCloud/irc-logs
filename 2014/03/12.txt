[2014-03-12 08:33:07] dogarrhea: ie driver is really slow
[2014-03-12 08:33:23] dogarrhea: part of it is our application, part of it is the driver taking 40 seconds to scroll down the page.
[2014-03-12 08:33:47] dogarrhea: what gives? i'm reading stuff about "no 64 bit driver" even if the client does use 64 bit ie.
[2014-03-12 08:34:03] jimevans: yep. that's right.
[2014-03-12 08:34:28] jimevans: for IE10 and higher, you shouldn't use the 64-bit IE driver. full stop.
[2014-03-12 08:34:45] dogarrhea: even if the client uses ie10
[2014-03-12 08:34:54] dogarrhea: we should not test on 64 bit ie10
[2014-03-12 08:35:17] dogarrhea: sounds like a good way to reduce defects (not)
[2014-03-12 08:35:31] jimevans: the dirty little secret of IE10 is that even when you're running "64-bit" IE10 (scare quotes intentional), the actual trident rendering process is a 32-bit iexplore.exe process.

[2014-03-12 08:53:16] dogarrhea: ie10 screws up when I scroll the page and try to click an element
[2014-03-12 08:55:04] jimevans: dogarrhea: probably not. the issue i'm describing applies only to either sending keystrokes, or if you're using the requireWindowFocus capability (which uses the same technique to ensure that all of the input primitives send via SendInput are processed before continuing)
[2014-03-12 08:57:03] jimevans: dogarrhea: are you "manually" scrolling the page before the click?

[2014-03-12 08:57:24] jimevans: ("manually" in quotes because i'm assuming you're executing code to do the scroll)
[2014-03-12 08:58:34] jimevans: okay, first question is "does the automatic scrolling when calling element.click() not work?"
