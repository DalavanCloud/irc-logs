[2014-03-05 03:38:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Hi guys - I came in here with what turned out to be an xpath question yesterday, I've been trying xpath out and it isn't working. http://pastie.org/8869113 is my html and the xpath is below it. What am I doing wrong please? Additionally, is my "Blah.asd.*" valid? (does xpath allow regex?) Thanks!
[2014-03-05 03:38:33] PavanGupta01, quitting. (Quit: PavanGupta01)
[2014-03-05 03:41:06] pyrho: WhereIsMySpoon, not sure XPath allow regexps but you could use:  a[contains(@href, 'javascript:Blah')]
[2014-03-05 03:43:14] pyrho: I'd use: //td[contains(., 'dfasaf')]/preceding-sibling::td/01a[contains(@href, 'javascript:Blah')]01
[2014-03-05 03:43:24] WhereIsMySpoon: pyrho: the contains worked!
[2014-03-05 03:43:30] pyrho: or just /01/01a[contains(@href, 'javascript:Blah')] if discriminating enough
[2014-03-05 03:43:43] WhereIsMySpoon: pyrho: nah I need the td stuff
[2014-03-05 03:43:56] pyrho: cool (:
[2014-03-05 03:44:05] pyrho: (that it worked)
[2014-03-05 03:44:17] WhereIsMySpoon: pyrho: whats the difference between //td[.='dfasaf']/..//a[contains(@href, 'javascript:Blah')] and your preceding-sibling xpath expression
[2014-03-05 03:44:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that expression doesnt match btw :p
[2014-03-05 03:46:38] pyrho: with the '..//' you go back all the way to the <tr> tag to go back down the <td> and the <div> (because you're using //), preceding-sibling directly accesses the td you want.
[2014-03-05 03:47:01] pyrho: But it's no big deal, just less optimized.. also if it's not working, well then.. :)
[2014-03-05 03:47:18] pyrho: I haven't tested it, but it should work.
[2014-03-05 03:48:14] WhereIsMySpoon: pyrho: it doesnt :)
[2014-03-05 03:48:16] WhereIsMySpoon: i just did test it
[2014-03-05 03:48:42] WhereIsMySpoon: but anyway thanks
[2014-03-05 03:48:45] WhereIsMySpoon: the other one does work
[2014-03-05 03:48:48] WhereIsMySpoon: :D

[2014-03-05 07:08:41] sag47: I've got a question and I'll quote myself from earlier as well as quote an answer another user gave me.  This is more of a followup.
[2014-03-05 07:08:48] sag47: 21:48 < sag47> I find the web profiling in selenium RC to be a vital function for determining bad resources on a loading web page.  That and one can get the status code of the parent page as well.
[2014-03-05 07:08:52] sag47: 21:48 < sag47> After messing with webdriver for a while I don't seem to see functions like that.
[2014-03-05 07:08:55] sag47: 21:49 < sag47> Is there plans to add that functionality to webdriver?  I notice Remote Control is being deprecated.
[2014-03-05 07:08:58] sag47: 21:58 < jimevans> sag47: the architecture of webdriver is significantly different than that of selenium rc. the latter was able to do those operations because it acted as a proxy through which all http traffic flowed. webdriver does not. thus, it would be next to
[2014-03-05 07:09:02] sag47:  impossible to add analogous functonality directly to webdriver. additionally, it's outside the scope of webdriver as a library (regard less of whether rc did so).
[2014-03-05 07:09:06] sag47: 21:58 < jimevans> however, one thing you could do is use a programmable software proxy with an API that would allow you to capture exactly the same information (and more!)
[2014-03-05 07:09:09] sag47: 21:59 < jimevans> i've heard many people have good luck with the browsermob proxy

[2014-03-05 07:09:35] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-05 07:09:43] sag47: While I'm researching some of the stuff jimevans suggested I still think there's an inherent flaw in using a proxy.
[2014-03-05 07:10:05] sag47: First, it doesn't handle SSL so well.  Not unless you run a MITM which I never recommend in general.
[2014-03-05 07:10:31] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 769
[2014-03-05 07:11:10] sag47: Second, I don't think a proxy would be a good enough solution for what I'd want to do with it.  I'd like to test network connections of resources on specific web pages.  A proxy like that isn't aware what requests are associated with which pages.
[2014-03-05 07:11:34] sag47: I'd prefer not to use a proxy at all but just the browser.
[2014-03-05 07:11:49] sag47: I disagree that a browser is limited in its ability to monitor stuff like that.
[2014-03-05 07:12:13] sag47: For Firefox, specifically, there's Firebug which hooks right into the network calls of the browser and it is simply and extension.
[2014-03-05 07:12:29] sag47: I'd like to see the profiling of a web page implemented as part of the testing suite.
[2014-03-05 07:12:48] sag47: Are there any plans for this for Selenium?  If there aren't, should there be?

[2014-03-05 07:22:13] sag47: WhereIsMySpoon: I don't want to profile it for load times per se.  I'm using the profiling just to look at the HTTP status codes of the resources on the page.  Whether they're loaded via link, script, AJAX, doesn't matter.  But keep the request associated with that page.
[2014-03-05 07:22:35] sag47: WhereIsMySpoon: I don't think that's necessarily out of the scope of the capabilities of webdriver.

[2014-03-05 11:36:11] lukeis: but attribute vs. property is easily confused and it's not straightforward that property get priority
[2014-03-05 11:38:58] barancev: did I misread or the javadoc tells "attribute has priority"?
[2014-03-05 11:40:59] lukeis: that's what is missing in the javadoc :)

[2014-03-05 13:31:36] dude-x: you will have to write an expectedCondition that will wait for a javascript expression to evaluate to true
