[2014-03-17 04:42:16] jimevans: joord: leaving aside that the wire protocol is something you shouldn't be worrying about (if your language binding doesn't hide that complexity from you, get a new language binding), you need to pass in either: 1. an index for the frame, 2. a "name or id" of the frame, or 3. a webelement reference to the <frame> or <iframe> element that you've found with a previous findElement call.
[2014-03-17 04:42:30] davehunt_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-17 04:42:39] jimevans: (or null, which takes you to the top-level browsing context, or "window.top" frame)

[2014-03-17 04:43:27] joord: jimevans: what do you mean by an index for the frame exactly?
[2014-03-17 04:43:27] jimevans: in other words, you can't use a locator like xpath directly in the call to the wire protocol method. you have to find the element first, then pass the resulting webelement reference to the frame method.
[2014-03-17 04:43:53] jimevans: joord: forget about that. it sounds like you want option 3.

[2014-03-17 04:44:27] joord: I've tried calling the element, and passing that in directly to the frame method, however in the server it seems to still be passing null
[2014-03-17 04:44:33] jimevans: but the "index" is equivalent to calling window.frames[i] in javascript, where i is the index in question.
[2014-03-17 04:44:46] joord: ah right ok
[2014-03-17 04:44:49] jimevans: joord: are you using javascript language bindings?

[2014-03-17 04:46:34] joord: so i guess i need a way to get the json object from the element somehow
[2014-03-17 04:47:30] jimevans: joord: so when you call the equivalent of findElement (however that language does that), you're given a dictionary/map/hashtable object that looks like {"ELEMENT": "<some element id, probably a guid>"}
[2014-03-17 04:47:45] jimevans: it's that object that needs to be passed into the switchTo().frame() call

[2014-03-17 04:49:44] joord: the annoying thing is the element function returns a php object of type "Element" that they define, not the one like you said
[2014-03-17 04:50:38] jimevans: so that "Element" object should be serializable to a JSON object with the structure i mentioned.

[2014-03-17 05:44:09] barancev: usage is very simple
[2014-03-17 05:45:21] barancev: e.g. to use a LoggingWrapper you have to write a single line
[2014-03-17 05:45:27] barancev: driver = new LoggingWrapper(originalDriver).getDriver();
[2014-03-17 05:46:04] barancev: and configure log destination as usually for slf4j
[2014-03-17 05:46:53] barancev: to decrease probability of stale reference exceptions you can do
[2014-03-17 05:47:16] barancev: driver = new StaleTolerantWrapper(originalDriver).getDriver();
[2014-03-17 05:47:47] barancev: and it will retry find operation if an element is lost
[2014-03-17 05:48:14] barancev: and of course you can compose wrappers

[2014-03-17 08:07:26] barancev: but I really really want this feature :)
[2014-03-17 08:07:26] jimevans: okay, so open question: how invested are we in keeping all of our handwritten javascript mouse and keyboard simulation code?
[2014-03-17 08:07:54] simonstewart: Because?
[2014-03-17 08:08:31] jimevans: barancev: i've brought it (changing caps at runtime) up a couple of times, and it's gotten nowhere. but i'm not super-passionate about it one way or the other.
[2014-03-17 08:08:48] drharmony, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-03-17 08:09:07] barancev: jimevans: two of us on the plus side then
[2014-03-17 08:09:09] jimevans: simonstewart: the canonical example is "i want to turn native events off for this action *only*, but not any others."
[2014-03-17 08:09:25] jimevans: barancev: nope, i'm really not on the plus side. i'm hugely indifferent to the solutions.
[2014-03-17 08:09:26] barancev: I've written several use-cases o\in my message
[2014-03-17 08:09:43] barancev: native events is not the only one
[2014-03-17 08:10:05] simonstewart: So, I see the capabilities as a bulk "what's the state of my driver" thing
[2014-03-17 08:10:14] jimevans: barancev: no, it's not the only one, but it's the most often cited one, which is why i call it the "canonical example" :)
[2014-03-17 08:10:30] simonstewart: Setting those features in bulk only feels like it makes sense when we're configuring the driver
[2014-03-17 08:10:43] simonstewart: After that, exposing methods/properties is probably a little more user friendly
[2014-03-17 08:10:44] simonstewart: no?
[2014-03-17 08:10:52] barancev: no :)
[2014-03-17 08:11:13] simonstewart: You think that a wedge of capabilities is more user friendly?
[2014-03-17 08:11:15] barancev: what's bad in changing the state of the driver?
[2014-03-17 08:11:28] simonstewart: Nothing bad about changing the state of the driver. It's how we do it that matters
[2014-03-17 08:11:49] simonstewart: Especially since we're heading more and more to a world where we hide capabilities from the user
[2014-03-17 08:12:00] simonstewart: cf: jleyba's change to do with Builders
[2014-03-17 08:12:07] barancev: right
[2014-03-17 08:12:08] simonstewart: And strongly-typed Options
[2014-03-17 08:12:09] jimevans: barancev: would you be okay with not exposing it as a "setCapability" method, but rather "setEnableNativeEvents", "setPageLoadStrategy", etc.
[2014-03-17 08:12:26] barancev: it is not about capabilities, it is about changing the state on the fly
[2014-03-17 08:12:30] jimevans: with those methods hanging off of the concrete driver object (not the interface)
[2014-03-17 08:12:32] simonstewart: That's why the Options interface was called that.
[2014-03-17 08:12:37] simonstewart: After the menu name in Windows
[2014-03-17 08:12:37] barancev: I like special methods
[2014-03-17 08:12:54] jimevans: or off the concrete options object. that'd work too.

[2014-03-17 08:13:46] barancev: out for an hour, sorry
[2014-03-17 08:15:03] jimevans: simonstewart: but the options interface doesn't have methods that change those behaviors. i guess we'd have to add 'em, plus the wire protocol bits to handle the changes.
[2014-03-17 08:15:14] *simonstewart nods'
[2014-03-17 08:15:37] simonstewart: It''d be tempting to pull the cookie handling stuff into a "CookieJar" at some point

[2014-03-17 08:22:08] joord, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-17 08:22:17] jimevans: it's a vestige of the original port of the API from java.
[2014-03-17 08:22:54] simonstewart: Navigate -> Destinations ?
[2014-03-17 08:22:58] simonstewart: Rubbish
[2014-03-17 08:23:48] jimevans: "Navigator" is the most proper term, but i *really* don't want to confuse the user with the DOM's "navigator"
[2014-03-17 08:23:58] simonstewart: Well, "to" could be removed from the Navigate interface. It was only there to read nicely, and I guess it'd be fine to an IWebDriver.Url property
[2014-03-17 08:24:08] simonstewart: Navigation?
[2014-03-17 08:24:14] simonstewart: History?
[2014-03-17 08:24:19] jimevans: and that's already what the setter for the .Url property does. :)
[2014-03-17 08:24:26] simonstewart: Right
[2014-03-17 08:24:44] jimevans: and the method is already GoToUrl() because "To" is a keyword in VB.NET
[2014-03-17 08:25:01] simonstewart: so Navigation deals with movement through history
[2014-03-17 08:25:04] simonstewart: "TimeMachine"?

[2014-03-17 08:25:56] simonstewart: The only thing that's on Navigation that's not on the official History API is "refresh"
[2014-03-17 08:26:17] simonstewart: If you wanted to rename it, "History" wouldn't be a bad choice

[2014-03-17 13:17:19] jleyba: jimevans: I'd be open for it if our plethora of event tests pass with a new implementation
[2014-03-17 13:18:25] jimevans: lionmancat: the TakesScreenshot implementation was pulled up the inheritance hierarchy from the browser-specific driver classes to RemoteWebDriver. meaning that subclasses (FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, etc.) all get getScreenshotAs() from inheritance rather than an explicit implementation of the interface. i suspect EventFiringWebDriver checks for instanceof, but doesn't take into account the inheritance hierarchy.

[2014-03-17 16:16:39] modeck: i have a hub running on a mac
[2014-03-17 16:16:47] modeck: and 2 nodes
[2014-03-17 16:16:55] modeck: one on W7, the other on ubuntu
[2014-03-17 16:16:58] jimevans: JT3: so do the encoding issues show up only in the screenshot, or also in the browser being driven?
[2014-03-17 16:17:09] modeck: from the hub machine
[2014-03-17 16:17:17] modeck: i run a PY script
[2014-03-17 16:17:17] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-17 16:17:25] JT3: jimevans: In both.
[2014-03-17 16:17:30] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I think he meant window.id (FFDriver checked for this at one point IIRC)
[2014-03-17 16:17:31] jimevans: ah. okay
[2014-03-17 16:17:32] jleyba: So you can remove that
[2014-03-17 16:17:34] modeck: which specifies 'Firefox', but not any version or operating system
[2014-03-17 16:17:46] modeck: i was expecting FF to launch on both nodes
[2014-03-17 16:17:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: aha...
[2014-03-17 16:17:53] AutomatedTester: jleyba: awesome, ta
[2014-03-17 16:17:54] modeck: but
[2014-03-17 16:18:06] modeck: it only launched on the node that was created first
[2014-03-17 16:18:14] modeck: and not the second one
[2014-03-17 16:18:22] modeck: make sense?
[2014-03-17 16:18:30] modeck: has anyone here ever encountered this before?
[2014-03-17 16:18:37] modeck: and what's the fix?
[2014-03-17 16:18:44] modeck: i know it's probably something simple and fundamental I'm doing wrong
[2014-03-17 16:18:52] modeck: please have some patience with a Selenium newcomer :)

[2014-03-17 16:19:16] jimevans: modeck: it's up to your test runner to handle launching code in parallel on multiple machines/nodes. just writing a piece of webdriver code and expecting it to run on multiple grid node just plain isn't going to work.

[2014-03-17 16:20:10] jimevans: grid doesn't do any multiplexing of webdriver code.
[2014-03-17 16:20:19] jimevans: (though it might be really cool if it did)
[2014-03-17 16:20:30] modeck: thanks jim, yeh that would be cool
[2014-03-17 16:20:44] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it does do multiplexing of the data that it gets
[2014-03-17 16:21:05] AutomatedTester: but test runners run things in sequence
[2014-03-17 16:21:25] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm not sure we're using multiplexing to mean the same thing.

[2014-03-17 16:22:17] jimevans: grid will forward commands on to a node, but it won't replicate the commands to multiple nodes at once, just by virtue of having multiple nodes registered.
[2014-03-17 16:22:31] jimevans: or create multiple sessions, given a single createSession command.
[2014-03-17 16:23:37] putenbrust: is there any frontend , where tests can be managed easyly with selenium
[2014-03-17 16:23:38] tony2, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-03-17 16:24:32] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I was meaning it in the sense that the hub takes multiple requests and redirects them accordingly like telephones
[2014-03-17 16:25:04] jimevans: putenbrust: tests are code (or they should be). you might as well ask if there's a front end by which unit tests for java code can be managed easily. there may be, but i'm not aware of one. now, if you mean test case managers, there are lots of those products out there. note that i've no recommendation about them.
[2014-03-17 16:25:54] jimevans: AutomatedTester: ah. i was using "multiplexing" to mean that it receiving a single request, then replicating that request out to multiple attached nodes.
[2014-03-17 16:26:05] putenbrust: ah jeah sorry :) but thanks for answering

[2014-03-17 16:29:04] modeck: @jimevans gotta plead newbie here, but would this work: target node by IP address, get PY to execute on each node simultaneolsy?
[2014-03-17 16:31:11] JT3: Anyways, if anybody can think of anything that might change re: character encodings when I use Selenium to drive Firefox versus when I run it myself, I would be eternally in your debt.
[2014-03-17 16:31:12] jimevans: modeck: no idea if that would work. i'd figure out a way to create multiple sessions. that is to say, run the same webdriver code multiple times (in parallel) connecting to the same hub. that might give you multiple instances running on multiple nodes.
[2014-03-17 16:34:01] modeck: @jimevans, so, just get the same PY script to execute simultaneously a number of times?
[2014-03-17 16:34:38] jimevans: i suppose. someone with more python experience than i would need to weigh in to see if that would work.
[2014-03-17 16:35:06] AutomatedTester: modeck: the way we do it at Mozilla is we use py.test with its xdist plugin
[2014-03-17 16:35:40] *jimevans is having waaaaay too much fun with powershell'
[2014-03-17 16:35:46] AutomatedTester: modeck: that then discovers all the tests and loads them up and runs the,

[2014-03-17 16:39:39] AutomatedTester: but for running I suggest looking at the py.test site

[2014-03-17 17:07:39] downtown: html
[2014-03-17 17:07:41] downtown: but text
[2014-03-17 17:07:52] AutomatedTester: because if its served as html then the browser will give it the bare minimum tags
[2014-03-17 17:07:57] AutomatedTester: or at least try to
[2014-03-17 17:08:04] downtown: AutomatedTester: I'll try the body tag
[2014-03-17 17:08:34] AutomatedTester: downtown: browsers only have 1 parser so everything goes through that
[2014-03-17 17:08:46] AutomatedTester: and it will try validate bits and pieces
[2014-03-17 17:11:14] downtown: AutomatedTester: so let's say I can get a handle on the body tag. How can I print the text inside?
