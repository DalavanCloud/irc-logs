[2014-03-06 02:13:43] welsboy: thats the html structure, problem is its all dynamic content, one day there may only be 1 or 2 times under a venue, another there could be 5+
[2014-03-06 02:14:59] welsboy: im wanting to print each title first and then print each time and url under that venue, issue is they are siblings, so i cant just say, select all children of this div take
[2014-03-06 02:15:52] welsboy: so i want venue1 -> time 1, time 2, time 3. venue2 -> time 4 time 5 time 6 time 7...

[2014-03-06 02:23:16] barancev: so what's the issue?
[2014-03-06 02:23:29] welsboy: i managed to get all of the venues extracted, i just cant figure out how to categorise all of the links under each venue
[2014-03-06 02:23:47] pyrho: that's the times:01 //tr/td[@class='bold']01/a[contains(@name, 'category')
[2014-03-06 02:24:01] welsboy: since there is no similar class names, id's, or anything

[2014-03-06 02:25:28] barancev: pyrho: no, links are in the next tr
[2014-03-06 02:26:52] welsboy: yeah the links arent contained in the same <td> as the bold class
[2014-03-06 02:27:03] barancev: welsboy: loop through 'tr's and create a map-like data structure: if the row is bold create a new bucket for the venue. if it is not bold add the link to the current bucket
[2014-03-06 02:27:35] barancev: don't hope xpath will replace programming
[2014-03-06 02:28:13] welsboy: i kind of tried that, but theres also a <TD class = divider> and another <TD> with an image inside

[2014-03-06 02:30:28] welsboy: thats working fine
[2014-03-06 02:30:42] welsboy: but the links dont have a class assignment to them

[2014-03-06 03:41:18] welsboy: okay thanks, ill take a look now
[2014-03-06 03:42:48] welsboy: the code i wrote is pretty basic and I was just trying to get the info I needed in whatever way possible, since i want to build a list with all the info and then use selenium to crawl through each url and scrape the contents of individual pages too
[2014-03-06 03:49:05] Dave_B_: Cool :)
[2014-03-06 03:49:22] welsboy: dave_b that answer was perfect! except you put get_element_by_tag_name instead of find_element_by_tag name, other than that its exactly what I was looking for
[2014-03-06 03:49:25] Dave_B_: I should warn you I wrote that straight into the SO window, so there are probably typos and other badness
[2014-03-06 03:49:29] Dave_B_: lol

[2014-03-06 03:52:02] welsboy: helped me so much. I would have been able to do it had i know i could do this "anchor = meet.find_element_by_tag_name('a')"
[2014-03-06 03:52:44] Dave_B_: yeah looking up elements from other elements is dead handy
[2014-03-06 03:52:54] welsboy: yeah i know! thanks

[2014-03-06 11:30:28] anndruu12: Hi. I'm a newbie to open source. Trying to load selenium into Eclipse. Getting an error that required library /third-party/java/android/android-14.jar is missing. Any idea's on how to remedy that?

[2014-03-06 11:31:45] lukeis: i'm fine with adding @deprecated now
[2014-03-06 11:31:54] lukeis: removal should be in 3.0

[2014-03-06 11:32:52] lukeis: like you want to make changes to Selenium itself?
[2014-03-06 11:33:12] lukeis: we all use IntelliJ :) you might want to try that instead
[2014-03-06 11:33:19] barancev: I should load it sometimes in eclipse
[2014-03-06 11:33:25] anndruu12: lukeis: correct. I use it normally for testing. But I'd like to get involved in open source contributing, and thought I would start with something I use

[2014-03-06 14:14:06] dogarrhea_: so, Thought tworks recommended the "page object model"
[2014-03-06 14:14:37] *lukeis recommends it too'
[2014-03-06 14:14:45] dogarrhea_: but now we are seeing that it totally and entirely sucks.
[2014-03-06 14:15:05] dogarrhea_: since we are duplicating code EVERYwhere
[2014-03-06 14:15:29] cgoldberg: why are you duplicating code everywhere?
[2014-03-06 14:16:13] dogarrhea_: let me start by an example:  A user uploads a document and uses page "blah".  ok. simple enough use page object model.  this is one test.  Now, the user uploads a document and goes to another place in the site. does some other stuff and comes back. we duplicate code now
[2014-03-06 14:16:19] lukeis: sounds like You're Doing It Wrong™  :)
[2014-03-06 14:16:48] dogarrhea_: there are workflows that span multiple pages
[2014-03-06 14:17:02] cgoldberg: but why wouldn't you reuse the same page object?
[2014-03-06 14:17:05] trycatch, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2014-03-06 14:17:29] cgoldberg: when revisiting the page
[2014-03-06 14:17:34] dogarrhea_: we do and it we are duplicating things that involve visiting multipel pages
[2014-03-06 14:17:40] dogarrhea_: over and over and over and over again.
[2014-03-06 14:17:55] cgoldberg: 1 page object for each page
[2014-03-06 14:18:26] cgoldberg: so if you have multiple pages.. sure multiple page objects... so where's the duplication?
[2014-03-06 14:19:17] dogarrhea_: page1.upload a document  page2.clickOk  page3.opendocument page4.modify document() we repeat these lines of code everywhere.
[2014-03-06 14:19:38] dogarrhea_: what object would I extract this in?
[2014-03-06 14:19:44] cgoldberg: a helper funtion
[2014-03-06 14:19:44] dogarrhea_: certainly not  a "page"
[2014-03-06 14:19:52] cgoldberg: function
[2014-03-06 14:20:08] dogarrhea_: there's mismatch between the model and this. we'll just have some folder with helpers everywhere?
[2014-03-06 14:20:40] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, no.. you extract common actions into functions
[2014-03-06 14:20:49] dogarrhea_: there are constants associated with each page too
[2014-03-06 14:20:50] cgoldberg: thje functions still call your page objects

[2014-03-06 14:21:31] lukeis: PageObjects are supposed to help you do everything on a page, if you are testing multiple page flows, I like to make "Flow" Objects that define certain behavior, like upload a document with x,y,z permissions set
[2014-03-06 14:22:20] lukeis: mostly it sounds like your app sucks though ;) cause why wouldn't you be able to do most of that on the same page :)  (where's the UX designer!)
[2014-03-06 14:23:21] lukeis: (and related, small 'widgets' on pages that are re-used everywhere, I like to make 'Widget' Objects and a Page object can be composed of many widgets)
