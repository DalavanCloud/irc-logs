[2014-03-11 04:33:44] ttyp0: indeed
[2014-03-11 04:33:51] detronizator___: but that said, I doubt
[2014-03-11 04:34:04] welshboy: haha yeah I understand that, its nothing illegal or anything like that. just trying to make my life a bit easier haha
[2014-03-11 04:34:24] ttyp0: well, the purpose is none of our business anyway. the question in itself is valid.
[2014-03-11 04:34:50] detronizator___: 2 different session are 2 different session: 2 phantomjs processes do not share the session
[2014-03-11 04:34:56] detronizator___: you are ALSO behind a tor
[2014-03-11 04:35:06] detronizator___: so I doubt the original IP can be traced
[2014-03-11 04:35:22] detronizator___: and even so, having the same IP means nothing nowdays: how about people working in the same office
[2014-03-11 04:35:32] detronizator___: you got tons of people from the same office... on facebook
[2014-03-11 04:35:38] ttyp0: yep
[2014-03-11 04:35:41] welshboy: thats what  thought. thanks for the info :)
[2014-03-11 04:35:47] detronizator___: based on the configuration they might be seen as same IP (or a pool)
[2014-03-11 04:35:47] ttyp0: I exploited that when Nimda was running wild
[2014-03-11 04:35:51] ttyp0: I collected statistics
[2014-03-11 04:35:53] detronizator___: but still different sessions
[2014-03-11 04:36:12] zeljkof_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-03-11 04:36:19] ttyp0: then I contacted certain organizations e.g. one university that apparently one of your computer classes has been infected, please clean your computers
[2014-03-11 04:36:38] detronizator___: welshboy: now, make sure you are not making a tojan that navigates to bank acocunts and steals moneys
[2014-03-11 04:36:40] ttyp0: I was even working for an antivirus company (F-Secure) at the time so it lent me some more credibility when making the calls
[2014-03-11 04:36:40] detronizator___: or something :)
[2014-03-11 04:37:05] ttyp0: sorry for OT but what I also did was to fight Nimda with Nimda
[2014-03-11 04:37:54] welshboy: detronizator___: dont worry I'm not. i gamble on horses for a living and im writing a script to place the bets for me, so nothing illegal
[2014-03-11 04:37:59] ttyp0: i.e. since my linux server was being bombarded with Nimda requests I made a php script that stored the attack vector, replaced the payload with "delete route 0.0.0.0" and then resent that exact same attack requests, with the modified payload, to the originating IP
[2014-03-11 04:38:13] detronizator___: ttyp0: :)
[2014-03-11 04:38:20] ttyp0: meaning, effectively, that I told the infected computers to drop themselves out of the Internet

[2014-03-11 04:38:40] detronizator___: welshboy: I might argue about that - I used to work for Betfair and automating betting is indeed not allowed
[2014-03-11 04:38:46] detronizator___: maybe not illegal though...
[2014-03-11 04:38:54] ttyp0: "route delete 0.0.0.0" actually. sorry. :)
[2014-03-11 04:39:36] welshboy: detronizator___: yeah i know they dont allow it, but personally, im the one who wants to place the bet and the amount etc... so i don't see it doing anybody any harm
[2014-03-11 04:40:00] detronizator___: those companies make money based on your speed as a human
[2014-03-11 04:40:14] detronizator___: if you take away the delay of you reacting to a news, a race or something
[2014-03-11 04:40:23] detronizator___: you are making money against their planned ods

[2014-03-11 04:40:29] detronizator___: but hey... I'm a develo
[2014-03-11 04:40:31] ttyp0: and I wouldn't call it automatic placing of bets when it is still human-initiated

[2014-03-11 04:40:42] detronizator___: please go ahead and take those bastards' money :)
[2014-03-11 04:40:50] welshboy: yeah i suppose that could be an advantage to me, but thats not how I intend to use it
[2014-03-11 04:41:12] detronizator___: welshboy: I haven't suggested you anything *wink wink*
[2014-03-11 04:41:16] detronizator___: :)
[2014-03-11 04:41:17] ttyp0: I would call that creative use of the game mechanics!

[2014-03-11 06:50:13] barancev: it's kinda feature :)
[2014-03-11 06:50:27] tlousky: Hmm... well, a feature that works nicely even in IE :-D
[2014-03-11 06:50:28] barancev: but quite annoying one
[2014-03-11 06:50:59] tlousky: Thanks
[2014-03-11 06:51:04] barancev: a feature is that chrome does check that an element is "clickable"
[2014-03-11 06:51:31] barancev: chromedriver I mean
[2014-03-11 06:51:34] barancev: other drivers don't check
[2014-03-11 06:52:17] tlousky: That's good,
[2014-03-11 06:52:24] tlousky: but this element is clickable, otherwise I'd get an error in the other drivers as well
[2014-03-11 06:52:33] tlousky: (though a different one)
[2014-03-11 06:53:15] barancev: the exact point chromedriver wants to click is not clickable (at least the drivers thinks so) -- most probably it is covered by some other element
[2014-03-11 06:54:01] barancev: usually is it not a problem. covered != not clickable
[2014-03-11 06:54:09] tlousky: Hmm. Strange. Well the structure isn't of a common button. You have a span with a hidden input, but when you click on it - it has an AJAX call that replaces the element and adds another class
[2014-03-11 06:54:12] barancev: but chromedriver....
[2014-03-11 06:54:40] barancev: so this call can cause another element o cover the one you want to click
[2014-03-11 06:54:45] tlousky: To the user it looks simply like a button click or selection, and for some reason in IE and FF it works nicely as well
[2014-03-11 06:55:06] barancev: IE and FF just do click
[2014-03-11 06:55:11] tlousky: Yeah
[2014-03-11 06:55:16] barancev: whichever element will get it no matter
[2014-03-11 06:55:30] barancev: but not chromedriver :)
[2014-03-11 06:55:51] tlousky: Shame chrome doesn't support that yet, maybe with some "protected" mode if you want to disallow random clicking
[2014-03-11 06:55:52] barancev: it is paranoid about ckickability :)
[2014-03-11 06:56:13] barancev: use Actions
[2014-03-11 06:56:34] barancev: moveToElement(...).click().perform()
[2014-03-11 06:56:35] tlousky: Strange thing is that I tried an action and that didn't do anything.

[2014-03-11 08:08:09] AutomatedTester: so if there are bits that are only needed for IE and you're testing firefox they are stripped out at compile time and copied to the FirefoxDriver build folder

[2014-03-11 08:14:53] phuh: lol this is a funny one
[2014-03-11 08:15:06] dogarrhea: manually, using ie does not have this problem of waiting 90 seconds for a page to scroll using the scroll bar ont he right.
[2014-03-11 08:15:41] phuh: what's the most convenient way to script automated in-browser scraper then?
[2014-03-11 08:15:59] phuh: if selenium is a painful way, there must be another
[2014-03-11 08:16:01] AutomatedTester: phuh: dont know, never looked into it

[2014-03-11 08:22:31] dogarrhea: if it's a desktop app, you can use windows api...
[2014-03-11 08:22:33] phuh: maybe not selenium, but is there a way to use opencv to do it?

[2014-03-11 08:24:10] dogarrhea: phuh, poker sites use heuristics and other hollistic crap to "determine you are cheating"
[2014-03-11 08:24:16] phuh: farlan: selenium was a bad solution for scraping for you?
[2014-03-11 08:24:34] dogarrhea: if your mouse movement goes beyond some range of "normal" or you play for hours on end etc.
[2014-03-11 08:24:42] dogarrhea: there's no real way to track you.
[2014-03-11 08:25:10] dogarrhea: heck. i even wrote an automation in gtk to OCR a virtual box instance on windows and they still said I was "cheating"
[2014-03-11 08:25:14] phuh: dogarrhea: i think i could use my own patterns and habits in the bot to fake it
[2014-03-11 08:25:20] farlan: wasnt bad. especially around the fact that you can run it in multiple browsers, what was painful about it was to try to get the same information from all browsers, and thus the need to rewrite/override/recompile the selenium API
[2014-03-11 08:25:24] dogarrhea: phuh: you need their data.

[2014-03-11 08:27:14] dogarrhea: selenium as a tool is extremely limited in scope.

[2014-03-11 08:30:48] dogarrhea: the best selenium can do for you is get you some job because you have a buzzword on resume or fill out online survey stuff.
[2014-03-11 08:31:08] phuh: dogarrhea: nah the poker/game question was not related to my motivation for stock data
[2014-03-11 08:31:50] dogarrhea: figure out how to use opencv+some wrapper to do your template matching.

[2014-03-11 09:02:05] jmasseo: and they have really bad external facing sites
[2014-03-11 09:02:15] jmasseo: the goal is to log into websites, and then download the files in a verifiable way
[2014-03-11 09:02:21] jmasseo: like an ops guy sits there and downloads the file
[2014-03-11 09:02:33] jmasseo: if i do a 'click()' download, then i have no way of telling when that transfer is done.

[2014-03-11 09:03:24] dimacus: jmasseo: ok here is my blog post, where i set up firefox to auto download certain file extensions to a given directory. So when you do selenium click() it just starts to download
[2014-03-11 09:03:29] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 776
[2014-03-11 09:03:38] dimacus: jmasseo: would you be interested in that?
[2014-03-11 09:03:48] dogarrhea: i doubt it's HIPAA sensitive information for it be web accessible
[2014-03-11 09:03:51] dogarrhea: unless it requires login
[2014-03-11 09:03:55] jmasseo: dimacus: my solution was a little requests based api, and a ghetto json serializer to log what files have been downloaded.
[2014-03-11 09:03:58] jmasseo: it requires login
[2014-03-11 09:04:00] jmasseo: and some of them have dynamic urls
[2014-03-11 09:04:21] jmasseo: hence my desire to use browser control
[2014-03-11 09:04:35] dimacus: jmasseo: well my solution would log into website, see a ton of links, start clicking on the links, and the files are auto downloaded
[2014-03-11 09:04:37] dogarrhea: you'll need a java awt robot to click "ok" for the download prompt too
[2014-03-11 09:04:43] jmasseo: all this crap is third party sh-tware from HP and Xerox and friends.

[2014-03-11 09:05:04] jmasseo: dimacus: cool
[2014-03-11 09:05:11] dimacus: it's in ruby, but you can convert it to whatever language pretty easily
[2014-03-11 09:05:15] dogarrhea: why not use Greasemonkey with downthem all?
[2014-03-11 09:05:17] jmasseo: yeah but i don't want to redownload old files.
[2014-03-11 09:05:35] jmasseo: because i want this to be trigged by a piece of automation software we have for managing file transfers.
[2014-03-11 09:05:42] dimacus: write a check on system before clicking link, if file exists, don't click download
[2014-03-11 09:05:43] jmasseo: it kicks off my selenium job then snarfs the output and moves it to its new home
[2014-03-11 09:05:44] dogarrhea: manage your greasemonkey script
[2014-03-11 09:05:47] jmasseo: where another piece of whatever does whatever
[2014-03-11 09:06:12] jmasseo: i might be able to do that
[2014-03-11 09:06:18] dogarrhea: selenium is for "oh i need ie8 and firefox to work. let me not manual test twice" although this use case is also not really feasible at this moment in time
[2014-03-11 09:06:19] jmasseo: it's worth noting i'm doing 25 of these.
[2014-03-11 09:06:30] jmasseo: and each one is completely different

[2014-03-11 09:07:25] dogarrhea: we had to upload pdfs manually by hand for the migration because their cms migration tool was broken. i wrote a greasmonkey script

[2014-03-11 13:03:48] lukeis: they are just hard-wired to code java that's optimized for android ;)
[2014-03-11 13:04:09] rorycb: ahhh :)
[2014-03-11 13:04:15] lukeis: would you write your selenium tests optimized for a platform they'd never run on? :)
[2014-03-11 13:04:40] rorycb: I write my selenium stuff like I write all my code :)
[2014-03-11 13:04:52] rorycb: not following cod standards makes me twitchy

[2014-03-11 13:08:57] AutomatedTester: lukeis: concating like that is fine... if you never worry about memory
[2014-03-11 13:09:34] lukeis: well, i'm just pointing out the 'optimizations' some developers are spending time on when they don't matter
[2014-03-11 13:09:57] lukeis: the test runner hasn't run out of memory (yet) and the process dies at the end of the run
[2014-03-11 13:10:39] lukeis: so, these sorts of optimizations seem so sillyâ€¦ (and wasting my time code-reviewing)
[2014-03-11 13:11:20] rorycb: AutomatedTester, is there really that much difference between the different concatenation methods?
[2014-03-11 13:11:31] AutomatedTester: rorycb: in Java there is
[2014-03-11 13:12:18] rorycb: AutomatedTester, fair. I know nothing about optimizing Java. I didn't realize it could be that extreme. What is the better way, out of curiousity
[2014-03-11 13:12:43] AutomatedTester: rorycb: in the memory it creates a new area so if you concat 4 bytes and  4 bytes you suddenly are using 16 bytes
[2014-03-11 13:12:54] AutomatedTester: rorycb: c# is the same
[2014-03-11 13:13:04] lukeis: using a StringBuffer  or  formatting the string   String.format("%s  %d", x, z);
[2014-03-11 13:13:32] lukeis: i think i just mixed python and java ;) oh well
[2014-03-11 13:13:58] rorycb: AutomatedTester, interesting, thanks for the TIL :) I am literally looking at C# today for the first time
[2014-03-11 13:14:09] rorycb: don't think I need to do anything with Strings thankfully
[2014-03-11 13:14:13] AutomatedTester: I <3 c#
[2014-03-11 13:14:29] lukeis: you strange strange man ;)
[2014-03-11 13:14:31] rorycb: I don't hate it yet :)
[2014-03-11 13:14:48] rorycb: It is giving me flashbacks of working with VB :)
[2014-03-11 13:15:04] AutomatedTester: rorycb: its not that different to java
[2014-03-11 13:15:13] AutomatedTester: except it has some nice python features
[2014-03-11 13:15:21] AutomatedTester: like lambdas
[2014-03-11 13:15:30] lukeis: there's plus sides of getting all the .NET stuff providedâ€¦ but downsides where the .NET stuff doesn't do exactly what you want and need to work around it  (this coming from my experience with it ~5 years ago)
[2014-03-11 13:15:35] AutomatedTester: and LINQ is amaze-balls
[2014-03-11 13:15:44] rorycb: I am noticing that, just figuring out the setup at the moment and trying to get a basic Selenium test up and running before I start the real work

I'm trying to compile the latest Selenium source (as of last night) and am getting errors when I run "go test_firefox" of "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Expected valid hostname but was localhost" anyone know why localhost would be an invalid hostname?

[2014-03-11 15:48:52] AutomatedTester: DavidN_A: it might be a ipv6 vs ipv4 issue

[2014-03-11 22:41:49] DavidN_A: Do you need the file, or do you need to test that something is behaving a particular way?

[2014-03-11 22:44:41] DavidN_A: Okay, so you actually need the file on your computer. The answer, to the best of my knowledge, is you can't.

[2014-03-11 22:45:18] DavidN_A: You can use another tool

[2014-03-11 23:22:09] sysko2: because right now of course as i control both  the hub and  the client,  i can harcode the possible values,  but that's a bit hackish as if i add new nodes to my selenium grid , my client does not get updated automatically
