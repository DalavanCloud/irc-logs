[2014-03-10 08:18:39] barancev: to preserve the mouse position or not?
[2014-03-10 08:19:22] ato: We addressed that in the last F2F actually.
[2014-03-10 08:19:54] ato: The mouse cursor's last position should be retained for the length of the actions sequence as I understand it.
[2014-03-10 08:20:48] ttyp0: bloodninja, well, not in any way that I'm aware of anyway

[2014-03-10 08:26:32] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am sure ato is remembering correctly
[2014-03-10 08:27:00] ato: Question is whether mouse cursor position should be retained across actions.
[2014-03-10 08:27:22] AutomatedTester: probably should
[2014-03-10 08:27:31] AutomatedTester: should be maintained for the page
[2014-03-10 08:27:50] ato: If you do action.mouse_move(100,100).perform(), then action.click().  Currently we're expecting an InvalidCoordinatesException.
[2014-03-10 08:27:51] AutomatedTester: when the page changes then we can reset it if the implementor wants to

[2014-03-10 08:29:24] ato: The reason I added that comment is probably because Opera was retaining the cursor's position.

[2014-03-10 09:47:44] barancev: nirvdrum: thanks!
[2014-03-10 09:47:52] jimevans: lukeis: default browser on Windows Vista.

[2014-03-10 09:48:11] lukeis: does vista still exist? :)
[2014-03-10 09:48:16] jimevans: alas, yes.
[2014-03-10 09:48:25] jimevans: pos though it is.
[2014-03-10 09:48:31] nirvdrum: barancev: I think we actually have two copies of jetty in play.  One vendored, one not.

[2014-03-10 09:48:39] Dave_B_1: oops? :p
[2014-03-10 09:48:43] jimevans: Dave_B_1: most of the sane world did too.
[2014-03-10 09:48:59] Dave_B_1: usage was tiny for us thankfully
[2014-03-10 09:49:03] Dave_B_1: not got rid of ie 8 yet
[2014-03-10 09:49:12] barancev: nirvdrum: yes, test server uses jetty 7.6.1 from third_party\java\jetty\
[2014-03-10 09:49:16] jimevans: i fear IE8 will be around for awile.
[2014-03-10 09:49:19] jimevans: awhile even
[2014-03-10 09:49:27] jimevans: default browser for windows 7
[2014-03-10 09:49:28] lukeis: 8 usage will only die when people finally get rid of their deprecated XP ;)
[2014-03-10 09:49:29] Dave_B_1: yeah, XP not updating past it will keep it dragging on
[2014-03-10 09:49:45] lukeis: jimevans: win7 defaults with higher nowadays
[2014-03-10 09:49:58] lukeis: the first version of win7 had it as default
[2014-03-10 09:50:07] lukeis: later versions had 9 (and then 10)
[2014-03-10 09:50:31] nirvdrum: jimevans: Vista's problem isn't so much it's the default.  You can't actually install IE8 on it.
[2014-03-10 09:50:42] nirvdrum: At least Win7 can update the browser through Windows Update.
[2014-03-10 09:51:04] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: eh? wut why
[2014-03-10 09:51:29] WhereIsMySpoon: ie8 was made after vista?
[2014-03-10 09:51:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont remember now T_T
[2014-03-10 09:51:34] rorycb: jimevans: any chance you might have time in the near future to whip together a C# browser constructor for BlackBerry? II can take a stab at it.. but I haven't been anywhere near C# before
[2014-03-10 09:51:43] jimevans: lukeis: i guess they've slipstreamed IE9.
[2014-03-10 09:51:59] nirvdrum: WhereIsMySpoon: Maybe I have that wrong.  But I thought it was stuck at IE7.
[2014-03-10 09:52:01] jimevans: nirvdrum: that, i didn't know (can't install IE8 on vista)
[2014-03-10 09:52:21] jimevans: but i'm quite sure windows 7 shipped with IE8
[2014-03-10 09:52:32] Dave_B_1: yep it did
[2014-03-10 09:52:44] nirvdrum: I may be confusing Vista with one of the Windows server variants.
[2014-03-10 09:52:52] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: i dunno i never used vista

[2014-03-10 09:54:38] jimevans: rorycb: probably not going to happen as part of the webdriver project per se. once things settle down a bit, i'm going to spin up a side project that has browser-specific drivers for the mobile platforms i care about (blackberry, winphone, selendroid, ios-driver)
[2014-03-10 09:54:48] jimevans: in the meantime, you can use RemoteWebDriver.
[2014-03-10 09:55:19] rorycb: jimevans: sounds like an interesting project
[2014-03-10 09:56:00] jimevans: rorycb: but it'll likely be awhile, so don't hold your breath.
[2014-03-10 09:56:02] rorycb: jimevans, I'll probably take a stab at it on my own them, remote works but you can't launch the browser remotely for BlackBerry so the constructor needs to do it
[2014-03-10 09:56:43] rorycb: I appreciate the up-front warning about time :)

[2014-03-10 10:00:24] rorycb: jimevans, yup it is that already, we have a dev tool that the browser constructor calls when it needs to launch the browser on device/simulator
[2014-03-10 10:00:38] rorycb: well it is a JAR but same difference really
[2014-03-10 10:00:59] rorycb: I have the ones written for Java, Ruby and Python already
[2014-03-10 10:01:02] jimevans: ah. okay, so it's a "run a shell command" piece from whatever langauge you're using.
[2014-03-10 10:01:11] rorycb: yup exactly
[2014-03-10 10:01:21] jimevans: that's pretty easy in .NET.
[2014-03-10 10:01:41] jimevans: there's plentiful examples in the Selenium .NET bindings.
[2014-03-10 10:01:48] jimevans: give me a sec and i'll point you to one.
[2014-03-10 10:01:49] rorycb: I am sure it is, has been in everything so far… just gotta find a windows PC and get the c# stuff setup
[2014-03-10 10:02:39] lukeis: so, you're almost exclusively running on mac then rorycb? :)
[2014-03-10 10:02:48] jimevans: actually, sounds like you could just subclass the DriverService class in the .NET bindings.
[2014-03-10 10:03:04] rorycb: lukeis, I am yes :)
[2014-03-10 10:03:15] *lukeis makes note of the linux 'issue' :)'
[2014-03-10 10:03:23] jimevans: look at InternetExplorerDriverService, ChromeDriverService, or PhantomJSDriverService for examples of how that works.

[2014-03-10 10:04:28] rorycb: jimevans - I have actually just been extending the RemoteWebDriver in everything else. then dropping into a exec to run a bash script to launch the browser
[2014-03-10 10:04:49] rorycb: jimevans, good to know. Will do that then :) Guess I know what i am doing tomorrow :)
[2014-03-10 10:04:56] rorycb: lukeis, will check that out.
[2014-03-10 10:05:09] jimevans: rorycb: that's about right, but i'd pattern it after the existing other drivers that launch an executable (IE, Chrome, PhantomJS).

[2014-03-10 10:05:24] lukeis: rorycb: you could provide a 'standalone' server that does that (when you call to make a new session it starts the BB browser and then just proxies all the rest of the commands)
[2014-03-10 10:05:37] gabriel, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-10 10:05:38] lukeis: and then you don't have to do anything for the language bindings
[2014-03-10 10:05:41] jimevans: i don't use mono much, mainly because i'm too lazy to fix the zip library we use to work on mono.
[2014-03-10 10:05:53] rorycb: lukeis, also I have a fix for the web server stuff in the python testing that uses localhost. just waiting for for 'legal' clearance to submit the pull request
[2014-03-10 10:06:12] jimevans: (or rather, i've submitted a patch, but the zip library is considered "stable" and no longer actively maintained)
[2014-03-10 10:06:50] rorycb: lukeis - yeah that is also an option :) going to get the ones I have out, then look at how better to do it :)

[2014-03-10 10:51:02] dimacus: bloodninja: you need to loop the whole suite to run over and over again?
[2014-03-10 10:51:08] bloodninja: yaya
[2014-03-10 10:51:28] lukeis: bloodninja: export the test suite to java or python or ruby (in webdriver format) and write real code :)
[2014-03-10 10:51:32] ttyp0: WhereIsMySpoon, don't have a place for webdriver yet - not gonna run it on mah laptop - but it's coming!
[2014-03-10 10:51:35] dimacus: bloodninja: ok, create a job in jenkins, make the job run your build, set the build to run on a cron every 10 mins
[2014-03-10 10:51:56] lukeis: (he's using IDE...)
[2014-03-10 10:52:01] bloodninja: i got nfi what jenkins or cron is..
[2014-03-10 10:52:06] dimacus: does not mean he can't use jenkins
[2014-03-10 10:52:09] bloodninja: right. IDE.
[2014-03-10 10:52:37] bloodninja: lukeis: i dont know any code :\
[2014-03-10 10:52:39] dimacus: bloodninja: then your best bet is listen to lukeis and export to a real language and run that way

[2014-03-10 10:54:50] lukeis: then you need to export it
[2014-03-10 10:54:52] ttyp0: "if" in IDE: script1 sets a variable. script2 either changes that value or doesn't, depending on certain conditions. script3 assert variable value x as the first step. if it passes, script3 is run. if it fails, IDE jumps straight to script4 which assert variable value y. repeat until the "conditional" execution is no longer necessary. my head hurts. :D

[2014-03-10 11:51:34] welshboy: sorry, completely forgot to mention it
[2014-03-10 11:51:49] welshboy: im using chrome, but im wondering if I should maybe swap to phantom.
[2014-03-10 11:52:07] lukeis: yeah, it's relatively easy to do with phantomjs
[2014-03-10 11:52:13] lukeis: https://coderwall.com/p/9jgaeq

[2014-03-10 11:52:57] welshboy: thanks lukeis, ill check it out
[2014-03-10 11:53:39] lukeis: typically with selenium the mantra is to just use the browser you're intending to test against on the platform you intend to test… user agent spoofing causes side-affects
[2014-03-10 11:54:26] welshboy: im not using selenium for testing purposes. im using it to scrape sites and to act as a bot
[2014-03-10 11:55:09] lukeis: :) some sites can detect selenium is being used (it leaves some tells behind)
[2014-03-10 11:55:28] welshboy: how so?
[2014-03-10 11:55:34] lukeis: and raw http requests are better to use anyways if you can
[2014-03-10 11:56:05] welshboy: yeah but im new to python and selenium does exactly what I need and is pretty simple to use
[2014-03-10 11:56:16] lukeis: most calls (to find an element or to click) that use the atoms will set an attribute on the body element

[2014-03-10 11:57:58] lukeis: for scrapping sites you should use phatomjs instead… much faster, you don't have to launch a full browser and wait for things like images to download
[2014-03-10 11:58:33] rorycb: was just going to say that… phantom is a much better way to grab data/info
[2014-03-10 11:58:48] welshboy: could i create my code using chrome and then swapto phantomjs before deploying
[2014-03-10 11:58:55] lukeis: sure
[2014-03-10 11:59:06] lukeis: not 100% guaranteed to work though :)
[2014-03-10 12:00:48] welshboy: the program will only really scrape 10 sites and then save all data to a csv, once thats done all data is stored in dictionaries and is used for the bot
[2014-03-10 12:01:48] welshboy: would phantomjs work for html created by javascript?
[2014-03-10 12:03:08] welshboy: since i would need to find text boxes, insert text, submit forms etc...

[2014-03-10 12:08:51] welshboy: does phantomjs allow websites to read installed plugins and fonts?
[2014-03-10 12:09:11] welshboy: such as this site... https://panopticlick.eff.org/

[2014-03-10 12:10:19] lukeis: status codes as strings is partially there i think
[2014-03-10 12:10:23] rorycb: welshboy, it doesn't support plugins :)
[2014-03-10 12:10:42] welshboy: okay thats really good to know!
[2014-03-10 12:11:11] welshboy: since the sites i will have selenium running on will likely use some sort of algorithms to detect ip and browser fingerprint
[2014-03-10 12:11:14] rorycb: It will still leave a fingerprint behind
[2014-03-10 12:11:21] welshboy: yeah I understand that
[2014-03-10 12:12:09] welshboy: but im thinking if i set the user agent to iOS or something, it shouldnt look too suspicious

[2014-03-10 13:42:12] dogarrhea: er class IETESTS extends testsThatRunOnFireFoxButNotOnIE
[2014-03-10 13:42:34] dogarrhea: and then override each individual test
[2014-03-10 13:43:24] dogarrhea: there is an end to end journey that's in one test that's pretty screwed up. but everything in there after logging into the application is dependent on each other
[2014-03-10 13:43:41] dogarrhea: so overriding that, would basically be rewriting that test entirely and it's a big test.
