[2014-03-19 06:10:24] omarek: My tests are usually like this:         self.assertIn('Currency', body.text)
[2014-03-19 06:11:13] omarek: They run quite slow. Is it just me, or searching entire body.text this way is Slow ? If so, what could I do instead ? Look up by element name ?
[2014-03-19 06:12:02] omarek: The tests are meant mostly to check that pages don't generate 500 Internal Server Error, and that content is actually loaded.

[2014-03-19 06:24:07] Dave_B_: omarek: Probably look up an element that is present if the page loads correctly. Ideally by e.g. id, class or something.
[2014-03-19 06:24:34] omarek: Dave_B_: why 'ideally' ? I remember better if there's a reason to something.
[2014-03-19 06:27:20] barancev: omarek: rendering body.text is slow, yes
[2014-03-19 06:27:51] barancev: because it is rendering -- selenium gets visible text
[2014-03-19 06:29:06] Dave_B_: ideally was probably a bad choice of word. I mean it's easy to get something by id, consistent, fast and doesn't break when someone makes a copy change

[2014-03-19 06:35:29] omarek: barancev: what's the difference ? If I look something by tag, name, id it doesn't have to load for whole body ?
[2014-03-19 06:35:41] omarek: I mean "WAIT for whole body"
[2014-03-19 06:36:38] barancev: because body.text renders the whole body text (that incliudes detecting visibility of each DOM node, a slow operation)
[2014-03-19 06:36:53] barancev: getting the text of a single element is much faster
[2014-03-19 06:37:24] barancev: because it renders only the subtree under this element
[2014-03-19 06:37:46] omarek: barancev: thanks for the tip. Unfortunately, this means I'll have to do (small) modifications to at least some of my tests.
[2014-03-19 06:38:12] omarek: Oh well. It's either that or no tests.
[2014-03-19 06:39:16] barancev: you can also try to use page_source instead of text, it is faster

[2014-03-19 07:08:42] barancev: simonstewart: another question: why wire protocol used to be implemented in REST-style, and how the current spec should fit it?
[2014-03-19 07:08:57] simonstewart: I don't understand
[2014-03-19 07:09:01] barancev: it looks non-restish
[2014-03-19 07:09:26] barancev: command names, session ids are to be passed in the payload
[2014-03-19 07:09:27] simonstewart: We never called it RESTful. We almost always refer to it as "REST-ish"
[2014-03-19 07:09:46] simonstewart: There are two reasons I picked meaningful URLs
[2014-03-19 07:09:59] simonstewart: 1) It makes it easy to view the logs of the server and know what the hell is going on
[2014-03-19 07:10:16] simonstewart: 2) It makes it easier to add smart routing by just parsing the URL rather than unpacking the JSON
[2014-03-19 07:11:27] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-03-19 07:11:34] barancev: makes sense
[2014-03-19 07:11:41] barancev: but what about the spec?
[2014-03-19 07:11:54] simonstewart: What about it? It'll mirror what we have now
[2014-03-19 07:11:59] simonstewart: The spec isn't us inventing new stuff
[2014-03-19 07:12:05] barancev: are we going to duplicate commmand name and session id in the URL and in the payload?
[2014-03-19 07:12:10] simonstewart: It's almost entirely about clearly documenting what we do
[2014-03-19 07:12:17] simonstewart: Yes we will
[2014-03-19 07:12:26] jimevans: simonstewart: the spec is (and ought to be) transport-neutral
[2014-03-19 07:12:42] simonstewart: It is. The only thing we do is mandate an HTTP/JSON implementation for interop
[2014-03-19 07:12:45] jimevans: though there is a caveat that implementers must provide an HTTP transport.
[2014-03-19 07:12:53] simonstewart: Right
[2014-03-19 07:12:56] jimevans: hah. irc-race!
[2014-03-19 07:13:12] simonstewart: If we didn't have the interop requirement, you'd lose a lot of the value of webdriver
[2014-03-19 07:13:18] barancev: duplication. ok. not very nice, but.... ok.

[2014-03-19 07:23:36] simonstewart: The payload is designed for use with any transport protocol and encoding
[2014-03-19 07:24:02] simonstewart: We happen to mandate a default that duplicates some of that in endpoint design to make certain common use cases easy
[2014-03-19 07:24:34] simonstewart: The first choice is sound design. The second is pragmatic. IMO
[2014-03-19 07:24:41] jimevans: at the moment, some client http transport implementations don't add the duplicated information into the json payload. :)
[2014-03-19 07:24:51] simonstewart: They will :)
[2014-03-19 07:25:16] barancev: they should, to conform the spec
[2014-03-19 07:25:23] simonstewart: That's why they will
[2014-03-19 07:25:52] jimevans: spec compliance is *such* a pain. (not really)
[2014-03-19 07:26:39] simonstewart: It's going to require a certain amount of fancy footwork with status codes
[2014-03-19 07:26:44] jimevans: (said the guy who has to implement spec compliance in at least two remote and one local end implementation)
[2014-03-19 07:26:52] simonstewart: bwhahahahaha
[2014-03-19 07:26:53] simonstewart: shit
[2014-03-19 07:26:58] simonstewart: I've got work to do too
[2014-03-19 07:26:59] simonstewart: :(
[2014-03-19 07:28:06] jimevans: see, that's why i just want to punt on some back compat, even if it's a poor story for end users.
[2014-03-19 07:28:08] barancev: btw, I'd suggest to add a version label (level 1) to the payload
[2014-03-19 07:28:40] barancev: and don't make it backward compatible
[2014-03-19 07:29:12] jimevans: and why, even though i understand the argument and will do whatever is required to implement it, i don't want 3.0 to be a drop-in replacement for 2.x
[2014-03-19 07:29:55] jimevans: i mean, i get it, i really do. but i'm going to whine, kick, and scream about it every step of the way.
[2014-03-19 07:30:08] barancev: 3.0 can support several versions of the protocol
[2014-03-19 07:30:17] simonstewart: no it fucking well can't
[2014-03-19 07:30:19] barancev: but they don't obey to be compatible
[2014-03-19 07:30:21] simonstewart: we're deleting stuff
[2014-03-19 07:30:42] barancev: ok, then, only new version, described in the spec :)
[2014-03-19 07:30:46] *simonstewart is feeling grumpy today, it seems :)'
[2014-03-19 07:30:55] barancev: and no ability to use older clients with newer implementation
[2014-03-19 07:31:02] simonstewart: Right. The last 2.x release will be forward compatible

[2014-03-19 07:31:56] barancev: I'm going to implement a new single end-point dispatcher in firefox-driver
[2014-03-19 07:32:02] barancev: that will be spec compatible
[2014-03-19 07:32:04] simonstewart: barancev: please leave it alone

[2014-03-19 07:32:12] simonstewart: Modify the existing one if you'd like
[2014-03-19 07:32:23] jimevans: simonstewart: i think i may have mentioned this before, but there needs to be a fair amount of coordination between implementers when we're ready for the first 3.0 release.
[2014-03-19 07:32:33] simonstewart: But the reason why firefox has mostly been left alone is because once marionette ships, we stop forward motion on it
[2014-03-19 07:32:36] barancev: step by step :)
[2014-03-19 07:32:51] barancev: "when"
[2014-03-19 07:32:58] simonstewart: It's in the betas now
[2014-03-19 07:33:00] barancev: what about two ESR releases?
[2014-03-19 07:33:22] simonstewart: AutomatedTester and ato: is marionette in this forthcoming ESR or the one after?
[2014-03-19 07:33:43] ato: It's in, but the protocol isn't compatible with the spec.
[2014-03-19 07:33:48] ato: It's currently somewhere in between.
[2014-03-19 07:34:03] jimevans: simonstewart: i've been running under the assumption that esr.next (projected for firefox 31) is marionette 1.0.
[2014-03-19 07:34:04] simonstewart: Let me rephrase that question: When can I delete the firefox driver.
[2014-03-19 07:34:12] simonstewart: same here
[2014-03-19 07:34:16] ato: Likely 2015.
[2014-03-19 07:34:20] barancev: actually , the most complex part is not the firefox driver, it's only 20-30 lines of code
[2014-03-19 07:34:25] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: when we change the rules for support for firefox

[2014-03-19 07:34:40] ato: Well yeah.  Depends which ESR you're targetting.
[2014-03-19 07:34:44] jimevans: which means that once firefox 24 rolls off being previous esr, that's when we can remove it.
[2014-03-19 07:34:52] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-19 07:34:57] barancev: client implementations and the grid dispatching mechanism are more imoprtant
[2014-03-19 07:35:08] jimevans: or, we abandon "previous esr" support.
[2014-03-19 07:35:18] jimevans: which might not be too bad, i suppose.
[2014-03-19 07:35:21] jimevans: i dunno.
[2014-03-19 07:35:24] ato: I'd be very much in favour of that.
[2014-03-19 07:35:31] ato: But I don't think we'll have time to get everything ready for this ESR.

[2014-03-19 07:35:59] jimevans: ato: well, shit, then.
[2014-03-19 07:36:03] barancev: don't worry about firefox driver
[2014-03-19 07:36:18] barancev: it is the less complex part, seriousely
[2014-03-19 07:37:26] mansi, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-03-19 07:37:28] jimevans: barancev: i'm sorry? the native-event-using, http-server-implementing, profile-manipulating-by-installing extension is "less complex"?
[2014-03-19 07:37:51] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-19 07:37:52] barancev: I mean "spec compatible protocol support"
[2014-03-19 07:38:01] barancev: in firefox-driver
[2014-03-19 07:38:08] barancev: is easy
[2014-03-19 07:39:26] jimevans: ato, AutomatedTester: is there a master bug list of current issues with marionette that shows how far away we are? (i'm assuming not, but just asking)
[2014-03-19 07:39:46] ato: There's https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721859
[2014-03-19 07:39:49] AutomatedTester: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Testing&bug_status=__open__&component=Marionette&order=changeddate%20DESC&list_id=9686180
[2014-03-19 07:39:52] ato: But it's not 100 % precise.
[2014-03-19 07:40:00] AutomatedTester: thats all the marionette bugs
[2014-03-19 07:40:11] simonstewart: barancev: the problem is that right now servers need to be forward compatible with 3.x and remain ok with 2.x clients
[2014-03-19 07:40:24] barancev: yes
[2014-03-19 07:40:41] simonstewart: As we close in on the release, we'll start getting a lot shoutier about updating to the latest and greatest
[2014-03-19 07:40:45] barancev: so we just need two different endpoints fore requests
[2014-03-19 07:41:15] simonstewart: I'd like to suggest shifting the 3.x release date to when we publish the WebDriver spec
[2014-03-19 07:41:32] barancev: e.g. /hub (current) and /v1 (new one for spec level 1)
[2014-03-19 07:41:49] jimevans: simonstewart: oh, i like that.
[2014-03-19 07:41:51] jimevans: yes, please.
[2014-03-19 07:42:06] simonstewart: I'll put it forward on the list
[2014-03-19 07:42:17] jimevans: or at least when it gets to last call.
[2014-03-19 07:42:50] simonstewart: Unless we ship 3.0 soonish, and then push for 4.0 to be the w3c compatible one.
[2014-03-19 07:42:56] simonstewart: Which seems a little user hostile
[2014-03-19 07:43:25] jimevans: my frustration with marionette is the lack of alignment of mozilla's priorities with my personal ones. :)
[2014-03-19 07:43:25] barancev: 3.0 without RC, anyway

[2014-03-19 09:12:41] dogarrhea_: for example. a user uploads a document.  When the ajax or whatever is complete for uploading a document, it scrolls the user to the content associated with this document
[2014-03-19 09:12:58] dogarrhea_: this is screwing up all sorts of selenium selecting
[2014-03-19 09:13:10] dogarrhea_: but it is a feature so it's selenium at fault here.
[2014-03-19 09:13:16] ato: I think the agreed upon way is to have a JS callback for when the animation is finished.

[2014-03-19 09:13:42] dogarrhea_: ato, how is this integrated with selenium?
[2014-03-19 09:14:13] dogarrhea_: developers aren't going to add extra code that will potentially slow the site down/make more maintenance just so selenium testers have an easier time testing.
[2014-03-19 09:14:28] ato: I'm not sure what you're asking.  How to do the callback to Selenium?
[2014-03-19 09:14:44] dogarrhea_: how does selenium know the animation is finished?
[2014-03-19 09:14:51] ato: Selenium itself doesn't.
[2014-03-19 09:15:01] ato: But it provides you with a way to find out.
[2014-03-19 09:15:09] dogarrhea_: which is?
[2014-03-19 09:15:15] ato: What I just described (-:
[2014-03-19 09:15:25] dogarrhea_: a callback? how does that integrate with selenium
[2014-03-19 09:15:31] ato: You set up a JS callback for the animation, and either check for that or use an event listening WD implementation.
[2014-03-19 09:15:33] dogarrhea_: groovy callback into js?
[2014-03-19 09:15:37] jimevans: dogarrhea_: how would you, looking at the DOM via javascript, know the animation is finished, without using selenium?
[2014-03-19 09:16:33] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-03-19 09:16:43] dogarrhea_: you wouldn't
[2014-03-19 09:17:05] dogarrhea_: the letter 'o' could be spinning in place infinitely.
[2014-03-19 09:17:35] dogarrhea_: ok. i'm going to just put thread.sleep since there's no way to really "automate" this
[2014-03-19 09:18:00] jimevans: dogarrhea_: and that's fine. what i'm asking you is how you would do it if you wanted to? if you wanted to query the DOM, from, say the firebug console or the chrome dev tools, to see if that animation was completed, how would you?
[2014-03-19 09:18:23] jimevans: "no way to really 'automate' this" - i'd be willing to bet you're wrong about that.
[2014-03-19 09:18:40] dogarrhea_: wtih the implication that it's really robust.
[2014-03-19 09:18:50] dogarrhea_: not just "thread.sleep(3000)"
[2014-03-19 09:18:59] jimevans: yep. that's what i mean too.
[2014-03-19 09:20:02] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-19 09:20:10] dogarrhea_: using js executor is robust in your mind i bet
[2014-03-19 09:20:19] jimevans: it certainly can be.
[2014-03-19 09:20:24] dogarrhea_: until it doesn't work.
[2014-03-19 09:20:35] jimevans: it's not my first choice, but needs must
[2014-03-19 09:20:42] dogarrhea_: then it's back to "flakey test using native javascript. why not just use phantom.js"
[2014-03-19 09:21:18] dogarrhea_: anyways i'm in developer mode now.  Gotta sort through the bootstrap code that does this animation.
[2014-03-19 09:21:24] dogarrhea_: do everything.
[2014-03-19 09:21:47] jimevans: i wouldn't last long at the company you're with. development seems extremely antagonistic toward putting any effort for making things testable.
[2014-03-19 09:21:54] jimevans: that's a recipe for failure long-term.
[2014-03-19 09:22:01] jimevans: in my experience.

[2014-03-19 09:28:49] dogarrhea_: having to develop javascript is not really a tester's job.
[2014-03-19 09:28:58] jimevans: dogarrhea_: you're welcome to that opinion. i don't share it.

[2014-03-19 09:30:39] dogarrhea_: not using eval explicitly (maybe?) but still the same concept.
