[2014-03-27 11:34:40] jimevans: nirvdrum: i didn't know there were pending things. i haven't pushed java binaries yet.
[2014-03-27 11:35:10] lukeis: well… the maven ones are uploaded, and I was *just* about to release to maven central...
[2014-03-27 11:35:14] nirvdrum: There's double error-handling if starting a session through RWD fails.
[2014-03-27 11:35:40] nirvdrum: It's probably not catastrophic.  But something I should clean up.
