[2014-03-02 20:40:32] sysko: i.e  for convenience i would like to put my grid in our datacenter, and have employees accessing to it through a public address, but of course I don't want it to be openbar ^^
[2014-03-02 20:41:26] sysko: if not possible directly from selenium grid, what do people use?  put a proxy with auth in front end ?
