[2014-03-21 08:05:01] Naeblis: I'm using Selenium to do some UI Testing in my application. Anybody know some way I can automate the testing process? Say, on my bitbucket, test everytime I create a pull request?
[2014-03-21 08:07:20] jimevans: Naeblis: sounds like you need a continuous integration (CI) server like, say Jenkins, coupled with whatever commit hooks your version control provider (bitbucket) gives you.
[2014-03-21 08:07:33] ato: If you have a continuous integration environment that runs your tests, it probably has some an API for triggering a test.
[2014-03-21 08:07:40] jimevans: but i don't have anything more concrete to offer than that.
[2014-03-21 08:07:44] Naeblis: thanks
[2014-03-21 08:07:46] ato: I'm guessing Bitbucket has the same for detecting when a commit comes in.

[2014-03-21 08:51:38] dogarrhea: wrongplace/tool/etc maybe. selenium isn't very robust. which is ironic because it's supposed to maintain robustness of other things heh

[2014-03-21 09:11:18] jimevans: LocusAsaf: no, dogarrhea is on about the IE driver. i (and pretty much only me) makes changes to the IE driver. thus, my code is shit. but nobody else seems willing to turn their fucking hands to do anything about how shitty the code is, so i get a little frustrated.

[2014-03-21 09:12:16] dogarrhea: and yes, you are in fact paid to develop the driver.  either that or you are hiding from your manager that you are working on open source

[2014-03-21 13:43:12] dude-x: Java is far more difficult to work with though;
[2014-03-21 13:43:14] EthenHunt: dude-x Yes I did that. Ruby is the problem.

[2014-03-21 13:43:41] dude-x: but if you have questions
[2014-03-21 13:43:47] dude-x: we can answer and decipher the java
[2014-03-21 13:44:00] EthenHunt: dude-x Consider the problem of logging into a website that has a browser level authentication dialogue
[2014-03-21 13:44:21] jimevans: EthenHunt: i guess i'm just used to translating back and forth between languages to consider choice of language a problem.
[2014-03-21 13:44:35] dude-x: oh. that's not supported by selenium well; you'd have to use a third party tool
[2014-03-21 13:44:51] jimevans: EthenHunt: you'll need to figure out a way to handle the authentication.
[2014-03-21 13:45:00] EthenHunt: dude-x jimevans  looking for a solution took me down the road where everthing was in Java
[2014-03-21 13:45:05] dude-x: if you have control of the code base, then lobby for a test automation hook to bypass that
[2014-03-21 13:45:17] EthenHunt: dude-x jimevans like invoking custom Firefox profiles
[2014-03-21 13:45:35] dude-x: hmm
[2014-03-21 13:45:44] dude-x: well if you can invoke a firefox profile that can sidestep that issue
[2014-03-21 13:45:49] dude-x: then you can do it in ruby as well
[2014-03-21 13:46:15] EthenHunt: And I was able to find that info for Java pretty easily, but not for Ruby
[2014-03-21 13:46:36] EthenHunt: dude-x anyone up for translating Dave's book into equivalent Java :)

[2014-03-21 13:48:52] EthenHunt: dude-x you have more experience than me I am sure, but I would like to know where do you think the difficulty will stem from?
[2014-03-21 13:49:49] dude-x: well i think dave's code relies a bit on the test infrastructure of ruby, which i think is rspec or something
[2014-03-21 13:49:58] dude-x: or whatever it's called
[2014-03-21 13:50:34] jimevans: EthenHunt: in most of the languages for the webdriver api, there's a mostly 1:1 correspondence, modulo stuff to make everything idiomatic to the language.

[2014-03-21 13:53:28] EthenHunt: jimevans thanks!! This is what I am referring to http://stackoverflow.com/a/13768031
[2014-03-21 13:53:55] jimevans: EthenHunt: you realize that example isn't java, right?
[2014-03-21 13:54:06] jimevans: it's c#
[2014-03-21 13:54:24] jimevans: (the PascalCase vs camelCase is the giveaway)
[2014-03-21 13:54:52] jimevans: but the principle still holds.
[2014-03-21 13:55:04] EthenHunt: jimevans I didn't know that, but that is just an example of both my ignorance and the disparity in the information available for the language of your choice
[2014-03-21 13:56:25] jimevans: EthenHunt: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/9696291
[2014-03-21 13:56:43] jimevans: straight port of that example into ruby.
[2014-03-21 13:56:50] mreedell-work, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-03-21 13:57:07] jimevans: basically, it's the exact same code, just idiomatic for ruby.
[2014-03-21 13:57:27] jimevans: in other words, so it "feels natural" to the way ruby code usually reads
[2014-03-21 13:57:50] jimevans: rather than shoehorning a bunch of java idioms (no properties, only set methods) into it.
[2014-03-21 13:58:03] jimevans: but it's very close to a 1:1 api translation.
[2014-03-21 13:58:16] EthenHunt: jimevans Thanks!!
[2014-03-21 13:58:25] EthenHunt: jimevans I begin to see what you mean
[2014-03-21 13:58:31] jimevans: and that's the case for most of the java examples you'll see.
[2014-03-21 13:58:40] jimevans: (or ruby, or c#, or python)
[2014-03-21 13:58:54] jimevans: they're usually pretty easy to translate from one language binding to another.
[2014-03-21 13:59:10] EthenHunt: jimevans In your experience for a person that still has the choice of language to make, is Ruby a better and safe alternative?
[2014-03-21 14:00:26] EthenHunt: jimevans Only when applying it to Selenium WebDriver
[2014-03-21 14:00:32] jimevans: EthenHunt: the best language is one you're comfortable coding in. second best is the one you can get the most help from developers on your team with (since they're likely to be co-located with you, and they're already fluent in the language). this second  is often (but not always!!!) the language the application is coded in.
[2014-03-21 14:01:18] jimevans: but that's why you'll often hear the advice of "write your tests in the language the application developers also use"
[2014-03-21 14:01:31] jimevans: it's not always applicable, but that's the reasoning behind that advice.

[2014-03-21 14:02:24] EthenHunt: jimevans Thanks for the insight
[2014-03-21 14:02:26] jimevans: some people like python and ruby (and other dynamic languages) because they're relatively lightweight in terms of tooling and iterative development ability.
[2014-03-21 14:03:00] EthenHunt: jimevans I have a morbid fear of code, looking at it makes my head hurt so I needed to be sure I am investing my time in a wise choice
[2014-03-21 14:03:07] jimevans: because they usually have a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop), or a command-line environment where you can interactively try stuff out.
[2014-03-21 14:03:22] jimevans: help me understand your fear of code.
[2014-03-21 14:03:38] EthenHunt: jimevans I look at it and I can't understand it

[2014-03-21 14:06:46] jimevans: (and yeah, i've done a bit of that)
[2014-03-21 14:06:56] AutomatedTester: EthenHunt: my advice, and it is a little biased, is pick something like python or ruby since they have a flatter API and you will get more confidence in what you are doing
[2014-03-21 14:07:26] EthenHunt: jimevans I completed my SCJD certification in 2006. I can't write medium level programs in Java now
[2014-03-21 14:08:00] EthenHunt: AutomatedTester Thanks. It makes sense.
[2014-03-21 14:08:21] AutomatedTester: EthenHunt: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/blob/master/tests/desktop/test_users_account.py#L21 is example of tests the QA team at Mozilla wrote
[2014-03-21 14:08:30] EthenHunt: AutomatedTester I would have to start from scratch for Ruby. Will do that.
[2014-03-21 14:08:50] jimevans: EthenHunt: i'd probably concur with AutomatedTester here. a dynamic language like python or ruby might make good sense. don't underestimate the value of the repl. type a command, see what happens. type another, see what happens.
[2014-03-21 14:09:21] EthenHunt: jimevans AutomatedTester Thanks for the insight!!
