[2014-03-04 05:57:07] barancev: the most crossbrowser, at least
[2014-03-04 05:57:50] jimevans: you might think it's more heavyweight than you require, but it is a very clean, well-understood, well-supported method of browser manipulation.

[2014-03-04 05:59:30] jimevans: however, in the case of phantomjs, you'd want to execute some script in the phantomjs page context. the standard webdriver executeScript method doesn't support this, but different language bindings (if they provide a phantomjs-specific driver, and it exposes it) may provide you a way to execute such a script.

[2014-03-04 08:08:46] smccarthy: bbguitar: k, should be compatible :( I use those two versions together ( but on windows )
[2014-03-04 08:09:27] bbguitar: Is there an older version of the chromedriver that's compat with 2.40 I could try?

[2014-03-04 08:50:24] dogarrhea: and besides, if selenium is supposed to track all of this "specific breakage", why doesn't it do a good job of that on say, changing a banner color to purple, or moving a div 10 pixels to the left
[2014-03-04 08:50:36] Dave_B_: Wait, changing a site isn't a change? I'm so confused. If they change the page at all then you want to know it still works -> your tests are valid. Yes, you can choose to accept those changes even though they break the tests, but doesn't mean the tests were either wrong or useless
[2014-03-04 08:50:40] dogarrhea: there's a logical contradiction here.

[2014-03-04 08:55:37] garndt: if you treat tests as a first class citizen, changing the app that then breaks tests is a bug, imo
[2014-03-04 08:56:53] jimevans: certain types of functionality changes are bugs. particularly if they are breaking pieces of the UI that the testing team relies on. caveat: you should be getting notification of these types of changes ahead of time, so that you can adjust, or at least expect you may have maintenance you need to do.
[2014-03-04 08:58:33] dogarrhea: either way, there is very little automation here. there's just more work and selenium doesn't catch all the ui changes regardless.

[2014-03-04 09:41:35] WhereIsMySpoon: So I'm doing some stuff which makes a list of things appear on the screen. This list of things is inside a html table and I know that in the <tr> I want is the link to click to open up the "thing" that I want to open. Now, I know that inside this tr there will be a certain text. My question is I guess, is there a way to get the parent <tr> with webdriver somehow, then click the link?
[2014-03-04 09:41:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Or do I have to do all this with the js driver and DOM manipulation
[2014-03-04 09:42:28] Voodoofish430, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-04 09:42:44] lukeis: you can either use javascript to find the element (or do the manipulation) or use xpath

[2014-03-04 09:43:32] WhereIsMySpoon: the problem is that the link I want to click on, doesnt even have an id. The only way to click on it is by asking it whether it has a certain onclick

[2014-03-04 09:43:55] lukeis: oh, that's relatively easy with css
[2014-03-04 09:44:14] *WhereIsMySpoon isnt very familiar with xpath'
[2014-03-04 09:44:16] lukeis: "a[onclick='sooperSekritMethod()']"
[2014-03-04 09:44:19] lukeis: css ^
[2014-03-04 09:44:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ah true, i can do the By.cssSelector for that
[2014-03-04 09:44:41] WhereIsMySpoon: I need to get to the parent <tr> first though
[2014-03-04 09:44:53] lukeis: "tr a[….]"
[2014-03-04 09:45:17] WhereIsMySpoon: the only thing I will know about it is that it will contain some text
[2014-03-04 09:45:18] WhereIsMySpoon: that I know what it will be
[2014-03-04 09:45:21] WhereIsMySpoon: thats it
[2014-03-04 09:45:21] JamesPrescott: yep "tr a[onclick='blah()']"

[2014-03-04 09:46:16] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: ok so to locate the parent tr I will absolutely know that it will contain in a sub <td> element (1 level deep) the text "blah_foo"
[2014-03-04 09:46:28] WhereIsMySpoon: thats all you have to go on
[2014-03-04 09:46:41] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: ok, then you need xpath
[2014-03-04 09:47:19] lukeis: "//td[.='blah_foo']/..//a[@onclick='foo()']"
[2014-03-04 09:47:25] lukeis: assuming it's the same row

[2014-03-04 09:56:36] ingshtrom_: so I am a bit confused with the 2.40 release of the .Net bindings.  I see here that RemoteWebDriver implements ITakesScreenshot: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/dotnet/src/webdriver/Remote/RemoteWebDriver.cs. Then I change the tag so that I reference the 2.40 version and RemoteWebDriver no longer implements ITakesScreenshot: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/dotnet/src/webdriver/Remote/RemoteWebDriver.cs?name=selenium-2

[2014-03-04 09:57:46] ingshtrom_: I noticed that with the binaries I pulled from http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.40/ that RemoteWebDriver does not implement ITakesScreenshot.  I'm confused on if it is supposed to or not? what is that first link to then if it isn't the most updated version?
[2014-03-04 09:58:19] ingshtrom_: or maybe the implementation of ITakesScreenshot for RemoteWebDriver will be a v2.41 release?
[2014-03-04 09:58:48] lukeis: ingshtrom_: yes, you're looking at 'master'  the 2.40 tag contains the 2.40 code as it was released
[2014-03-04 09:58:55] lukeis: so, 2.41 yes

[2014-03-04 18:58:12] jimevans: sag47: the architecture of webdriver is significantly different than that of selenium rc. the latter was able to do those operations because it acted as a proxy through which all http traffic flowed. webdriver does not. thus, it would be next to impossible to add analogous functionality directly to webdriver. additionally, it's outside the scope of webdriver as a library (regardless of whether rc did so).
