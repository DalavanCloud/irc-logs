[2014-03-26 05:06:00] barancev: selenium just sets the browser preferences
[2014-03-26 05:06:27] camcam: barancev: do you know how i can .wrapmodule that? for example if I want to use smtplib through socks5 proxies i can use socks.wrapmodule(smtplib)

[2014-03-26 05:07:01] camcam: but the browser itself is not a module, right?
[2014-03-26 05:07:01] barancev: you can configure the browser to point to your own second-level proxy that performs authorization on behalf of the browser
[2014-03-26 05:07:16] camcam: lol

[2014-03-26 05:45:42] sircapsalot: yes, yes :)  Thread.sleep(2); is a non-defined explicit wait as it were.. i was just defending something that was not really defined on my part. i made a blanket statement.  i deleted my comment ;)
[2014-03-26 05:46:34] jimevans: No need to delete it, I just wanted to clarify what you meant.
[2014-03-26 05:47:11] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-26 05:47:22] jimevans: We use the term "explicit wait" to mean something pretty specific, and it's a standard well-understood practice.
[2014-03-26 05:49:58] jimevans: Sounds like we have some more evangelism to do if the term "explicit wait" is seen as meaning "Thread.sleep()"
[2014-03-26 05:50:29] sircapsalot: i know the difference, it's evident i'm familiar with selenium (per my SO profile)  i just tend to get literal.  explicit means "no doubt in what it's saying."  a thread sleep is irrefutably an explicit action.. since sleeping can be == waiting, i tend to name the two the same.

[2014-03-26 06:10:31] barancev: ide.iml seems to be an orphan
[2014-03-26 06:10:41] barancev: it is IDEA
[2014-03-26 06:10:45] jimevans: Ah
[2014-03-26 06:11:07] sircapsalot: yea, iml = IDEA Markup Language (or IntelliJ)
[2014-03-26 06:12:44] jimevans: Just looking at the contents, selenium.iml has an awful lot of android stuff in it.

[2014-03-26 06:16:22] sircapsalot: no, it looked more like actually for the Selenium IDE
[2014-03-26 06:16:45] barancev: right, it is a module file for the IDE

[2014-03-26 09:24:12] WhereIsMySpoon: ok Ive found my problem
[2014-03-26 09:24:19] WhereIsMySpoon: I have an <input type="file"
[2014-03-26 09:24:48] sircapsalot: WhereIsMySpoon: Great! glad you figured it out
[2014-03-26 09:24:53] WhereIsMySpoon: and im using driver.findElement(By.id("blah")).sendKeys(f.getCanonicalPath()); but that isnt setting it properly
[2014-03-26 09:25:28] WhereIsMySpoon: if I go to the dev console and do (say my file input's id is "myFileInput") $('myFileInput').files i can see a file with 0 length there
[2014-03-26 09:25:43] WhereIsMySpoon: whereas if I just click on this button normally without selenmium and select the same file, i can see its been put there properly
[2014-03-26 09:26:02] WhereIsMySpoon: so is using sendKeys to an <input type="file" not correct?
[2014-03-26 09:26:49] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: no, that's absolutely the correct approach. no others will work when using only webdriver.
[2014-03-26 09:27:08] jimevans: (you'd need an external library to handle the file selection dialog, in other words0

[2014-03-26 09:27:49] WhereIsMySpoon: well something is wrong

[2014-03-26 10:05:34] ttyp0: one reason for the picture's situation is the fact that the longer a bug exists in code the more dependent on the bug the code becomes
