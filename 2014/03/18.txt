[2014-03-18 12:36:09] linuxr: confusion++

[2014-03-18 12:37:00] lukeis: linuxr: we bundle both Selenium RC and WebDriver into one "standalone" package that includes everything
[2014-03-18 12:37:28] lukeis: which one is used is up to the client (test) code
[2014-03-18 12:37:36] linuxr: I see
[2014-03-18 12:37:52] linuxr: and RC is the old javascript-injection variant  and webdriver the new native browser control?
[2014-03-18 12:37:57] lukeis: yes
[2014-03-18 12:38:07] lukeis: 'native' can be a loose term ;)
[2014-03-18 12:38:11] linuxr: and the server works with both?
[2014-03-18 12:38:12] lukeis: but mostly, yes
[2014-03-18 12:38:16] lukeis: yes
[2014-03-18 12:38:32] linuxr: okay I see
[2014-03-18 12:38:41] linuxr: but then there's still the IDE variant
[2014-03-18 12:38:44] lukeis: Selenium 3.0 will be the same too
[2014-03-18 12:38:52] lukeis: yes, that's a Firefox add-on
[2014-03-18 12:39:12] linuxr: when I have some of these IDE tests stored in HTML format, can I also run this with webdriver?
[2014-03-18 12:39:14] lukeis: (there's also another add-on called 'Selenium-builder')
[2014-03-18 12:39:26] lukeis: that's called Selenese…
[2014-03-18 12:39:38] lukeis: you need to export them in the IDE to webdriver tests
[2014-03-18 12:39:59] linuxr: export to what format?
[2014-03-18 12:40:03] lukeis: or you can use the "RC" part of the standalone to execute the 'Selenese' html code directly
[2014-03-18 12:40:08] lukeis: WebDriver format
[2014-03-18 12:40:22] lukeis: in whichever language you want (Java, C#, Python, Ruby)
[2014-03-18 12:40:25] linuxr: I thought webdriver is more of an API than a file format?
[2014-03-18 12:40:46] lukeis: format is a bad term… it's converting
[2014-03-18 12:41:00] linuxr: it converts html to e.g. a java application?
[2014-03-18 12:41:11] lukeis: to a .java file
[2014-03-18 12:41:15] lukeis: not application
[2014-03-18 12:41:35] lukeis: you then need to compile it / etc
[2014-03-18 12:41:35] linuxr: the selenium-builder does that?
[2014-03-18 12:41:55] lukeis: selenium builder is essentially the same product as Selenium IDE
[2014-03-18 12:42:12] lukeis: (just built a different way to potentially use on more than Just Firefox)

[2014-03-18 12:52:06] jimevans: another series of comments on an issue that whinge about "every release, and no fixes" #3719

[2014-03-18 12:55:38] jimevans: that particular issue only talks about that language binding, but similar issues are reported against java
[2014-03-18 12:55:43] jimevans: ("the browser may have died")
[2014-03-18 12:56:00] *lukeis loves it'
[2014-03-18 12:56:06] barancev: right, Java is in the same boat
[2014-03-18 12:56:19] jimevans: when the http call times out, you're done.
[2014-03-18 12:56:21] lukeis: and no one has provided a chromedriver log when it happens?
[2014-03-18 12:56:29] barancev: it is FF
[2014-03-18 12:56:33] jimevans: chromedriver appears to be fixed, mostly
[2014-03-18 12:56:53] lukeis: your most recent comment on that linked bug seems to say otherwise
[2014-03-18 12:57:15] jimevans: now, because the error message is generic enough, and people need lessons in reading comprehension, most of the recent comments look like they're firefox related.

[2014-03-18 12:58:18] barancev: aha, and the previous comment is FF-related
[2014-03-18 12:58:31] lukeis: and I bet none of them can answer the question "did the browser actually crash when this happened?" :)
[2014-03-18 12:59:12] barancev: and what's on the browser console

[2014-03-18 13:02:06] barancev: anybody can answer the question I asked AutomatedTester about? I can't understand the idea of mapping commands to the protocol level. is section 2.6 applied to both HTTP and WebSocket and TCP (Marionette)? why some other sections describe HTTP methods corresponding to the commands and how are they related to 2.6?
[2014-03-18 13:02:15] jimevans: :spec

[2014-03-18 13:03:06] barancev: our current HTTP implementation is REST-style
[2014-03-18 13:03:26] mdgreenfield, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-03-18 13:03:27] barancev: session id and element id are parts of the URI
[2014-03-18 13:03:41] barancev: and the command name too
[2014-03-18 13:03:44] jimevans: i strongly disagree with that. the command descriptions should all be transport-agnostic.
[2014-03-18 13:03:56] barancev: JSON mapping suggests to put this info into the JSON payload

[2014-03-18 13:04:27] barancev: so HTTP protocol should have a single endpoint, right?
[2014-03-18 13:04:35] lukeis: i'm neither here nor there on it
[2014-03-18 13:05:00] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-18 13:05:29] jimevans: i like the requirement that implementers must provide and HTTP transport shim. i hate referencing the HTTP version in anything other than the appropriate appendix.
[2014-03-18 13:06:34] jimevans: but remember, barancev, there's absolutely nothing preventing additional parameters in the json payload. the instruction is to ignore such extra parameters.
[2014-03-18 13:06:58] jimevans: in the case of the http transport, things like session id, element id, and command name would be superfluous.
[2014-03-18 13:08:32] tony1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2014-03-18 13:09:03] jimevans: lots of things about the spec i'm indifferent about. this is not one of those things.
[2014-03-18 13:09:22] barancev: I think duplication of parameters (in URL and in payload) is a bad thing
[2014-03-18 13:09:52] jimevans: i care very very little about that.
[2014-03-18 13:10:09] jimevans: i care very very much about being able to have an implementation that doesn't rely on the http transport
[2014-03-18 13:11:04] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ++
[2014-03-18 13:11:13] AutomatedTester: I would rather have the duplication
[2014-03-18 13:11:41] mdgreenfield, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-18 13:11:43] barancev: what's bad in single HTTP end-point?
[2014-03-18 13:11:57] mdgreenfield, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-03-18 13:12:04] barancev: and JSON payload described in the spec
[2014-03-18 13:12:09] jimevans: barancev: that's a perfectly valid question.
[2014-03-18 13:12:42] barancev: this implementation will be much closer to WebSocket and TCP ones
[2014-03-18 13:13:00] barancev: so the client side would be more uniform

[2014-03-18 13:13:53] barancev: and there is deleteCookie command that does not fit REST-style
[2014-03-18 13:14:15] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am happy with doing that
[2014-03-18 13:14:24] AutomatedTester: barancev: the way to make this happen is raise a bug
[2014-03-18 13:14:43] barancev: a bug on the spec?
[2014-03-18 13:14:49] AutomatedTester: yes
[2014-03-18 13:14:52] barancev: ok
[2014-03-18 13:14:59] AutomatedTester: bugs are subjective in nature
[2014-03-18 13:15:07] barancev: and...
[2014-03-18 13:15:16] AutomatedTester: and then email the w3c mailing list about the bug and let the discussion go from there
[2014-03-18 13:15:16] jimevans: simonstewart does have an argument about why a rest-ish api was originally designed. i don't remember that argument off the top of my head.
[2014-03-18 13:15:32] barancev: I remember someone asked about spec-compatible server side implementation
[2014-03-18 13:15:42] AutomatedTester: that was Marc that asked that
[2014-03-18 13:15:49] AutomatedTester: he was wondering about the duplication
[2014-03-18 13:16:10] barancev: expected wondering
[2014-03-18 13:16:41] barancev: but what was the answer?
[2014-03-18 13:16:41] AutomatedTester: I agree with JimEvans that the name of the command should be in the JSON payload
[2014-03-18 13:16:56] barancev: I don't remember where it was discussed
[2014-03-18 13:17:04] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-18 13:17:09] AutomatedTester: barancev: the W3C payload fwiw is not not compatible with WebDriver as is
[2014-03-18 13:17:22] AutomatedTester: but is with Marionette...  :D
[2014-03-18 13:17:48] barancev: ok, 1) I'll raise a bug on the spec
[2014-03-18 13:19:08] barancev: 2) I'll start implementing alternative HTTP endpoint in firefox driver that fits the spec
[2014-03-18 13:19:38] AutomatedTester: alternative HTTP endpoint?
[2014-03-18 13:19:49] AutomatedTester: or do you mean alternative JSON packet?
[2014-03-18 13:20:06] barancev: yes, HTTP as transport for JSON payload
[2014-03-18 13:20:29] AutomatedTester: ok cool
[2014-03-18 13:20:43] barancev: and the payload is spec-conformant

[2014-03-18 22:59:26] lukeis: where in the world are you?
[2014-03-18 22:59:50] lukeis: 11 hour shift from me...
[2014-03-18 23:00:02] lukeis: oh yeah, we had daylight saving time
[2014-03-18 23:00:17] barancev: Moscow, Russia, UTC+4

[2014-03-18 23:01:50] lukeis: ha
[2014-03-18 23:02:46] barancev: it's jenkins (git failure)
[2014-03-18 23:03:30] lukeis: it's the fact that the workspace has a modified version of the prebuilts (without an updated index) and git couldn't over write it
[2014-03-18 23:03:46] lukeis: just kicked off another build with the config wiping the workspace first
[2014-03-18 23:03:49] barancev: right. why it is modified?
[2014-03-18 23:04:30] lukeis: the prebuilts would look modified on any machine (other than mine) that actually built them
[2014-03-18 23:04:45] barancev: does jenkins build so files?
[2014-03-18 23:04:47] lukeis: seems our jenkins box could actually build the linux prebuilts for us
[2014-03-18 23:05:02] lukeis: `./go release` will do it if the libraries exist
