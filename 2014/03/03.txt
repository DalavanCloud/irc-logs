[2014-03-03 07:26:09] jimevans: benfranklin: so the .net bindings work like this: first they look in the registry for the "software\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox" key (first in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then in HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
[2014-03-03 07:27:16] jimevans: if it finds the key, it looks for the path to the executable by looking for a value with the name "CurrentVersion", and then looks for a subkey named "<value of CurrentVersion>\Main".
[2014-03-03 07:27:28] jimevans: then looks for a "PathToExe" value in that key
[2014-03-03 07:27:57] jimevans: if it can't find the Mozilla Firefox key, it looks in standard install locations for the executable.

[2014-03-03 08:04:13] rorycb: I should note that this behaviour only exists for our dev tools, I believe it shuts everything down not associated with those when it does to sleep
[2014-03-03 08:04:59] rorycb: When it is in dev mode it is assumed you know what you are doing since you had to explicitly turn them on
[2014-03-03 08:05:31] ato: Right.  Well this doesn't seem unique to Java?
[2014-03-03 08:05:45] ato: A failed response is a failed response, right?
[2014-03-03 08:05:56] ato: Maybe the Python HTTP client library is being more forgiving.
[2014-03-03 08:06:22] rorycb: Yeah python isn't reporting this issue, but you are right it may be more forgiving
[2014-03-03 08:09:53] rorycb: actually, just managed to replicate this when the device was awake… I will have to investigate this some more
[2014-03-03 08:10:25] ato: Hm.  Sounds like package loss?
[2014-03-03 08:10:39] ato: Which really shouldn't affect HTTP…
[2014-03-03 08:11:28] rorycb: It is odd. I have run the test 4 times with the device awake and it appeared 3 times, but not the fourth and in when it did appear it appeared at different points in the process
[2014-03-03 08:11:57] rorycb: so yes it seems like some kind of communication issue, but odd that everything still completes successfully
[2014-03-03 08:12:47] rorycb: Even with the device asleep I am getting it sometimes once, sometimes twice at different points
[2014-03-03 08:13:03] rorycb: but still have all the expected data and responses.
