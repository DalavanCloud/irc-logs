[2014-03-20 02:57:55] ato: furoido: Anyways, you'll need to go through the steps of entering that data as WebDriver is just a standalone library to control your browser.  It doesn't instrument it in anyway.

[2014-03-20 03:14:45] ato: furoido: The typical way you solve this in a test environment is to instrument your webapp to treat all browser sessions with a specific cookie as logged in to a given account, however.
[2014-03-20 03:15:06] furoido: ato: i guess ill have to repeat the login everytime then

[2014-03-20 03:15:40] ato: furoido: Well like I said you can set a cookie from WebDriver, and have the Django app special case that.
[2014-03-20 03:15:59] ato: furoido: (Which is a security hole, so make sure it's not enabled in production.)

[2014-03-20 03:17:38] ato: omarek: Well actually you could be connected , but the value being returned from the driver is null, so it treats it as an empty string.
[2014-03-20 03:17:48] ato: omarek: Does it happen in another browser as well?
[2014-03-20 03:18:17] omarek: ato: you mean another driver ? Such as chromium ?

[2014-03-20 03:19:52] elopio, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-20 03:19:57] omarek: ato: It's not empty. Usually the tests pass, sometimes they fail.
[2014-03-20 03:20:24] sorinello: ato: thanks
[2014-03-20 03:20:46] ato: omarek: Are you able to pinpoint why?  It's extremely difficult for me to guess why that is.
[2014-03-20 03:21:06] ato: sorinello: It's the same with all the major drivers FWIW.
[2014-03-20 03:21:37] omarek: :-(. I don't know. The website is slow, sometimes it does take several seconds to load.
[2014-03-20 03:21:57] omarek: It seems that implicit wait has helped, after all - now I only see 1 kind of traceback.
[2014-03-20 03:22:45] ato: omarek: Aha, I see.  You could add  an explicit wait for the title.
[2014-03-20 03:23:31] ato: omarek: Something like title = WebDriverWait(self.browser, 42).until(lambda d: return d.title if d.title is not None else False)
[2014-03-20 03:23:41] sorinello: ato: could you also tgive me a hint why native events are not enabled on Se 2.39.0 + Firefox 26 even if I elabled them from my code ? I am running on a CentOS machine, and I suspected it was because of a shared FF profile, but it turns out it's not related. Any wild guess ?
[2014-03-20 03:23:42] ato: Where 42 is the number of seconds to wait.
[2014-03-20 03:23:50] ato: omarek: (Also I didn't run that code.)
[2014-03-20 03:24:33] ato: sorinello: I don't really know much about native events in the old FirefoxDriver, but barancev prbably does.
[2014-03-20 03:25:36] sorinello: barancev: any hint ? I am stuck for 3 days because click() and sendKeys does not work in a tinyMCE Editor, and I don't understand why nativeEvents is false. And
[2014-03-20 03:27:15] barancev: what selenium version and FF version do you use?
[2014-03-20 03:29:15] barancev: ah, I see, sorry
[2014-03-20 03:29:43] barancev: no idea why. show the code
[2014-03-20 03:32:50] ato:         # If the server doesn't send a response, assume the command was

[2014-03-20 03:32:50] ato:         return {'success': 0, 'value': None, 'sessionId': self.session_id}
[2014-03-20 03:32:51] ato: wtf.
[2014-03-20 03:33:40] sorinello: barancev: I have the same build on a Ubuntu system and it's working, and on another one I have a CentOS, on which is NOT working. The difference is that the CentOS is running Firefox 17.0.10 ESR
[2014-03-20 03:34:36] sorinello: barancev: but on both machines, I have a Firefox 26 version downloaded which is used by webdriver. Because FF 26 is compatible with SE 2.39.0 . which you already know
[2014-03-20 03:35:12] sorinello: barancev: basically webdriver is not using the FF installed in the system with the package managers, but instead it uses the firefox I downloaded
[2014-03-20 03:36:27] barancev: sorinello: can you check the firefox error console on the centos host and :gist it

[2014-03-20 07:24:44] jimevans: if only i were using a debian-derived distro. or linux for that matter.
[2014-03-20 07:26:08] simonstewart: barancev: let's not be too hasty
[2014-03-20 07:26:11] simonstewart: (in entish)
[2014-03-20 07:28:35] barancev: temporary means that for some period one driver wants requests in old style, whereas another driver already accepts new style requests
[2014-03-20 07:28:54] barancev: so the client should be able to serve both
[2014-03-20 07:28:57] simonstewart: barancev: I know what you're saying
[2014-03-20 07:29:06] simonstewart: But this approach isn't the right one
[2014-03-20 07:29:20] simonstewart: We should be fine without the need for the client or server to sprout "v1" or "v2" yet
[2014-03-20 07:29:43] simonstewart: But right now, I'm up to my eyeballs in work
[2014-03-20 07:29:51] simonstewart: And I've not got the attention to spare on this.
[2014-03-20 07:30:05] barancev: which is the right one? is if condition a better wat?
[2014-03-20 07:30:05] simonstewart: But half-way temporary solutions are not the way forward
[2014-03-20 07:30:13] barancev: *way
[2014-03-20 07:30:39] davehunt_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-03-20 07:30:50] barancev: it is not half-way, it is complete for FF
[2014-03-20 07:30:57] simonstewart: So this diff does a number of things
[2014-03-20 07:31:02] simonstewart: 1) Renames some methods
[2014-03-20 07:31:06] barancev: but not for all drivers
[2014-03-20 07:31:10] simonstewart: 2) Introduces a second httpcommandexecutor
[2014-03-20 07:31:26] simonstewart: 3) Does something to the value of the session id in the firefox driver
[2014-03-20 07:31:44] simonstewart: We want to be forward compatible
[2014-03-20 07:32:04] simonstewart: Without breaking current compatibility
[2014-03-20 07:32:20] simonstewart: First off. I'm rolling this change back for now.
[2014-03-20 07:32:38] barancev: where it is not forward copatible?
[2014-03-20 07:32:39] simonstewart: I fundamentally disagree with bits of it
[2014-03-20 07:32:44] barancev: *compatible
[2014-03-20 07:32:56] simonstewart: And it lacks focus
[2014-03-20 07:33:03] barancev: hm...
[2014-03-20 07:33:16] simonstewart: And the log message doesn't actually explain much
[2014-03-20 07:33:32] simonstewart: Then I'm going to drop my day job
[2014-03-20 07:33:36] simonstewart: and do this the way I want it done
[2014-03-20 07:33:55] barancev: ok :)
[2014-03-20 07:34:20] simonstewart: I apologize right now for being a grumpy bastard
[2014-03-20 07:34:38] simonstewart: Sorry barancev
[2014-03-20 07:36:49] barancev: to clarify: 1) method in firefox driver renamed to conform to command names, 2) second command executor sends new style requests, 3) sessionId should be send as a string not as an object according to the standard
[2014-03-20 07:37:10] simonstewart: I know. We'll sort this out cleanly
[2014-03-20 07:37:12] simonstewart: Promise
[2014-03-20 07:37:19] barancev: today? :)
[2014-03-20 07:37:37] simonstewart: I am literally just opening the selenium project in IJ now

[2014-03-20 07:46:53] simonstewart: It should be "mouseButtonClick"
[2014-03-20 07:47:07] jing1: is it going to cause issue if i'm on java 7?

[2014-03-20 08:17:40] dogarrhea_: for example, we might use active mq
[2014-03-20 08:18:02] dogarrhea_: and it turns out that MQ has a bug in it where the queue fills up and state completely freezes and nothing gets added into or removed from the queue.
[2014-03-20 08:18:38] dogarrhea_: and this manisfests itself as "the user can't do this"
[2014-03-20 08:18:48] Dave_B_: then its a fail for me
[2014-03-20 08:18:56] Dave_B_: can't prove it works -> doesn't work
[2014-03-20 08:19:04] dogarrhea_: how much time do we spend diagnosing this seemingly random issue?
[2014-03-20 08:19:53] dogarrhea_: basically when people say "not reproducible" when we file the bug
[2014-03-20 08:20:04] dogarrhea_: and then it happens in production some time later, what usually happens

[2014-03-20 08:20:24] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-20 08:20:24] Dave_B_: its hard to say, depends a lot on the team you work with
[2014-03-20 08:20:55] Dave_B_: if they've got decent logging then they shouldn't need the queue to be full/frozen/whatever when they come to investigate
[2014-03-20 08:21:20] dogarrhea_: heh. that is somethign we lack.
[2014-03-20 08:21:31] Dave_B_: yeah, it's common for that to be lacking :(
[2014-03-20 08:21:39] Dave_B_: miles from perfect here too
[2014-03-20 08:22:32] dogarrhea_: i guess the question is, for 1 person, is maintaining load tests and selenium tests reasonable scope
[2014-03-20 08:22:35] Dave_B_: if possible I tend to jump on a dev as soon as a test fails so the cause hasn't been cleared yet but even then, they might do something ineffectual, say its fixed and it just doesn't happen to reoccur for some time
[2014-03-20 08:22:54] dogarrhea_: making sure that dev ops AND application develoeprs are maintaining quality in what they do
[2014-03-20 08:23:49] dogarrhea_: we don't even have security testing in place yet heh
[2014-03-20 08:24:41] Dave_B_: umm again hard to say definitively - depends how many tests for how rapidly changing an application etc. In general I'd have thought it sounds like a painful experience so not a great idea

[2014-03-20 08:25:22] Dave_B_: I'm not a fan of having an automation guy at the end, instead preferring multi-skilled testers within each team but that's not a decision that testers can normally make :(
[2014-03-20 08:25:42] dogarrhea_: this isn't erally code level quality anymore
[2014-03-20 08:25:49] dogarrhea_: code or application

[2014-03-20 11:24:21] dimacus: hmmm this can be a wild chase, but in ruby, i use "capybara" which is using the "nokogiri" html parserâ€¦ basically once you have found the element you want, you can ask if it is visible
[2014-03-20 11:24:36] dimacus: not sure if it's the test framework that does that or the HTML parser
[2014-03-20 11:24:46] dogarrhea: eh.
[2014-03-20 11:24:51] dimacus: butâ€¦ i wonder if you can use one of the groovy/java HTML parsers
[2014-03-20 11:25:04] dimacus: and ask if element is visible

[2014-03-20 11:25:47] dimacus: i used to find a text box that was on the bottom of the page and send a "click" command to it, which would force the browser to scroll down and bring the text box into view
[2014-03-20 11:25:53] dimacus: before i start to sendKeys

[2014-03-20 11:27:17] dogarrhea: WebElement.isDisplayed() has some funny behaviors sometimes
[2014-03-20 11:27:44] dimacus: what about using something like jQuery to ask for the current loation of the scroller?

[2014-03-20 11:28:47] dogarrhea: there are definitely "can the user see it" limitations in selenium
[2014-03-20 11:29:02] dimacus: yeahâ€¦ thats very true
[2014-03-20 11:29:16] dimacus: things like layout are super dificult to do without OCR
[2014-03-20 11:29:25] dimacus: and even then it sucks and is crazy slow
[2014-03-20 11:29:41] dogarrhea: and peopel will yell at you if yoru test doesn't catch it
[2014-03-20 11:30:46] dogarrhea: ok i'll OCR it. the content is actually some disclaimer text that the user should see
[2014-03-20 11:30:59] dogarrhea: like actually see
[2014-03-20 11:31:13] dogarrhea: so people don't sue us. it must be in view. on the monitor.
[2014-03-20 11:33:40] dogarrhea: once the FDA passes these "biomedical devices and products" standard that all our clinicians talk about, i doubt we would be able to depend on selenium to fully satisfy the testing requirements for that standard

[2014-03-20 20:09:41] furoido: and i dont know what would be the behaviour
[2014-03-20 20:10:18] furoido: the thing is, sometimes the emails are sent immediately, sometimes it takes a while
[2014-03-20 20:12:01] dude-x_: use the webdriver wait class

[2014-03-20 20:14:38] furoido: to write a code to automate opening of emails.. ok cool
[2014-03-20 20:15:31] dude-x_: if your email has an imap interface or pop3 interface, you can skip webdriver and use a pop3/imap library
[2014-03-20 20:15:36] dude-x_: much easier to deal with
