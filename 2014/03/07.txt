[2014-03-07 05:50:16] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-03-07 05:50:34] ttyp0: for some reason IDE doesn't like using xpath=//input[@type="text"] as the locator, but it works fine with xpath=//div[@id="searchTextDiv"]/input
[2014-03-07 05:50:55] ttyp0: i.e. matching from one step higher in the page hierarchy
[2014-03-07 05:50:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: maybe there was another text input?

[2014-03-07 05:59:59] ttyp0: aye

[2014-03-07 06:00:36] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: im currently in the process of automating some common manual tests in a new project - when I'm done im gonna create a library of commonly used code (like selecting common things from a drop down filter, etc)
[2014-03-07 06:00:53] ttyp0: then I can edit that file but always have to save with a different name (so as not to "ruin" the template)
[2014-03-07 06:00:53] WhereIsMySpoon: that way you can develop without worrying too much about genericity then do that afterwards

[2014-03-07 06:04:46] ttyp0: I'm not 100% sure how to formulate it properly, though. this search thing that I'm doing with the script that was failing a moment ago... I'm supposed to search for an item on a long list and then verify it's shown in the search result. the problem is, the item is already visible on the page before the search (basically, the search is just applying a filter on a big list to narrow it down). can you think of a good way to verify I'm actually ...
[2014-03-07 06:04:52] ttyp0: ... matching the filtered search result instead of finding the item from the original long list? :)
[2014-03-07 06:06:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: does the search reload the area in which the results are returned?
[2014-03-07 06:06:06] ttyp0: what I'm thinking right now is to make sure the search is specific enough to only yield exactly one result and then make sure that matching "the 2nd row of results" fails
[2014-03-07 06:06:20] WhereIsMySpoon: that isnt really a good way to do it
[2014-03-07 06:06:23] WhereIsMySpoon: not future proof
[2014-03-07 06:06:26] ttyp0: I know :(/
[2014-03-07 06:06:48] ttyp0: the filtering is handled through a couple of javascript eventhandlers (I hate the implementation)
[2014-03-07 06:07:15] ttyp0: reasons I hate it: the system does not search if you type in text and hit enter. it searches when you enter text and wait 500ms
[2014-03-07 06:07:16] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: so do the search and then do a wait for element load with the name/value/id or whatever it is
[2014-03-07 06:07:18] ttyp0: ...
[2014-03-07 06:07:37] ttyp0: reason*
[2014-03-07 06:09:02] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: how about my solution?
[2014-03-07 06:09:17] ttyp0: let me try
[2014-03-07 06:11:07] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[2014-03-07 06:11:48] ttyp0: I may have to use pause instead of WaitForText or waitForElementPresent since the element is already present on the list before the search so Selenium doesn't stop to wait with those at all. it's funny, the script completes before the search has even been performed (due to that 500ms wait after last keypress before actually submitting the search)
[2014-03-07 06:12:09] ttyp0: but maybe I could force it with fireEvent(?)

[2014-03-07 06:20:35] WhereIsMySpoon: you can put on elements
[2014-03-07 06:20:48] ttyp0: one additional problem is that all the relevant data is already there on the list so I can't search and wait for some additional piece of information to grab a hold of :)
[2014-03-07 06:21:06] WhereIsMySpoon: like literally <a onkeypress="javascript:blah"></a>
[2014-03-07 06:21:14] Dave_B_: check a bit of data that should havew been filtered out is gone before checking the stuff you want is still there?
[2014-03-07 06:21:19] ttyp0: WhereIsMySpoon, yeah
[2014-03-07 06:21:27] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: so why have this shitty event handler
[2014-03-07 06:21:41] ttyp0: I've absolutely no idea. "customer specified it like that"
[2014-03-07 06:21:58] ttyp0: think they got some dude there with his head up his ass, thinking he's creating cool new features
[2014-03-07 06:22:01] ttyp0: :P

[2014-03-07 06:22:23] WhereIsMySpoon: "yes, id like my app to be slower please. about 500ms slower"
[2014-03-07 06:22:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :S
[2014-03-07 06:22:26] ttyp0: well, it's just something to bring up in the next meeting
[2014-03-07 06:22:49] ttyp0: I think the reasoning was more like "look, it actually searches automatically, you don't have to do anything!"
[2014-03-07 06:23:03] WhereIsMySpoon: so why not make it a proper auto search
[2014-03-07 06:23:06] ttyp0: expecting a "wow, ooh"
[2014-03-07 06:23:06] WhereIsMySpoon: that filters as you type
[2014-03-07 06:23:11] ttyp0: indeed
[2014-03-07 06:23:12] WhereIsMySpoon: like google search
[2014-03-07 06:23:16] WhereIsMySpoon: >_>
[2014-03-07 06:23:26] WhereIsMySpoon: seems like a piece of crap
[2014-03-07 06:23:38] WhereIsMySpoon: but who am i to judge
[2014-03-07 06:24:13] ttyp0: in this context, I agree
[2014-03-07 06:24:14] ttyp0: it is

[2014-03-07 06:24:43] ttyp0: well, I will just bring this up in the next meeting saying that the current implementation is very much hampering the testability of the search
[2014-03-07 06:24:57] ttyp0: another thing I love: each unique item has a unique id... which may change
[2014-03-07 06:25:13] ttyp0: all the IDs are always unique but they might not remain the same they originally were. for the exact same object.
[2014-03-07 06:25:35] WhereIsMySpoon: usefu
[2014-03-07 06:25:36] WhereIsMySpoon: l
[2014-03-07 06:25:52] ttyp0: yeah, and that's beyond our control thanks to an underlying platform that does it
[2014-03-07 06:26:45] WhereIsMySpoon: so all in all you have a really nice web app
[2014-03-07 06:26:47] WhereIsMySpoon: :D

[2014-03-07 08:46:57] lukeis: general principle is have your test setup and tear down the data it requires
[2014-03-07 08:47:22] lukeis: and be 'hermetic' … meaning self-contained and non-overlapping with anything else

[2014-03-07 08:55:54] lukeis: no, if it's in the frame and you switched to it, should be fine
