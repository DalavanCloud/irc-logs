[2014-03-13 04:18:24] andy_seit: Mornin
[2014-03-13 04:20:39] barancev: day!
[2014-03-13 04:23:59] barancev: jimevans: you're a clever man and you should know what should be the result of driver.executeScript("return window.frames[1]")
[2014-03-13 04:24:19] barancev: (the frame is present on the page)
[2014-03-13 04:25:01] jimevans: you'll probably get a serialized json object that looks like a javascript "window" object. except that's a pretty complex object, so it might fail miserably.
[2014-03-13 04:25:25] jimevans: because in the browser, you get the window object of the frame.
[2014-03-13 04:25:44] barancev: IE driver returns a web element
[2014-03-13 04:25:55] jimevans: yep. not surprised.
[2014-03-13 04:26:02] jimevans: i know it will, and i know exactly why
[2014-03-13 04:26:14] barancev: FF driver hangs, and I'm trying to understand why this shit happens
[2014-03-13 04:27:13] jimevans: i'd wager it's due to the complexity (and possible recursiveness) of the object.
[2014-03-13 04:27:13] barancev: so you said FF behaviour is "more correct". hmm...

[2014-03-13 04:29:18] barancev: lets' use chrome as an arbiter
[2014-03-13 04:29:47] barancev: "unknown error: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[2014-03-13 04:30:05] barancev: well...
[2014-03-13 04:30:08] jimevans: as for IE, the javascript object returns an IDispatch that doesn't implement a property of JScriptTypeInfo. the IE driver's script executor guesses that any such object is an element.
[2014-03-13 04:30:18] jimevans: it's a bug in the IE driver.
[2014-03-13 04:30:25] jimevans: i'm well aware of it.
[2014-03-13 04:31:23] barancev: I'd prefer this bug be a feature
[2014-03-13 04:31:36] jimevans: yep, that's not surprising. window is a recursive object. try serializing window.self.
[2014-03-13 04:31:39] barancev: at least the driver should not hang
[2014-03-13 04:31:53] jimevans: it's recursive.
[2014-03-13 04:32:38] barancev: but we can detect this case and throw an exception or do something but not hang and eat the CPU
[2014-03-13 04:32:57] jimevans: so in the executeScript handler for any object, you'd need to do some detection of recursive objects during serialization.
[2014-03-13 04:33:08] barancev: right

[2014-03-13 04:33:21] jimevans: not entirely sure how you do that
[2014-03-13 04:33:52] barancev: no idea yet :)
[2014-03-13 04:34:09] jimevans: i think a stack overflow is perfectly acceptable.
[2014-03-13 04:34:11] barancev: what about driver.executeScript("return window.frames[1].frameElement") ? should be better
[2014-03-13 04:34:42] jimevans: as long as you're not cross-domain, you should be fine there.
[2014-03-13 04:35:01] barancev: chrome throws stack overflow, it is acceptable
[2014-03-13 04:35:16] barancev: FF hangs, that's what I dislike
[2014-03-13 04:37:44] jimevans: so JSON.stringify(window) in IE throws. ("circular reference in value argument not supported")
[2014-03-13 04:38:00] jimevans: i'd try that in firebug and see what happens.

[2014-03-13 12:14:56] jimevans: no, you're missing my point. you catch the timeout exception, then just turn around and call .click. should be that simple. unless you mean that the click is where you're getting the timeout exception. in which case, you should just catch the exception and wait for the next item you're looking for to show up.

[2014-03-13 13:11:55] jimevans: it might get slightly tricky, though. part of the change is in switchTo(), so that means your role-based interface will have to hang off TargetLocator.

[2014-03-13 13:30:57] barancev: simonstewart: let's create a branch for 2.0 and update it only for new Firefox versions, and start shipping 3.0 alpha versions from master without RC

[2014-03-13 13:35:48] simonstewart: what's wrong with the wiki page?
[2014-03-13 13:36:30] jleyba: jimevans: I'm not sure how it would actually work with maintaining backwards compat, but the idea is to move the "start the session logic" into the static create(options) method

[2014-03-13 13:36:42] jleyba: and the ctor becomes a simple "set executor and session ID"
[2014-03-13 13:37:15] simonstewart: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ShippingSelenium3
[2014-03-13 13:38:06] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, you're right, that'd suck for back-compat. how would you anticipate injecting your own stuff into the process of session creation, if session creation is done in the static method?
[2014-03-13 13:38:38] jimevans: or does that require knowledge of what the static method does?
[2014-03-13 13:38:56] jleyba: proper encapsulation and abstractions so you could build your own factory  method?
[2014-03-13 13:39:12] jleyba: I'm being intentionally hand wavy
[2014-03-13 13:39:19] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-03-13 13:40:18] dogarrhea: so, no one knows why http://www.pasteall.org/50225  is only pointing to windows servers?
[2014-03-13 13:40:29] dogarrhea: and that this is "good enough" for selenium ie automation/
[2014-03-13 13:40:48] jimevans: i'm still not getting it, but i'm pretty dense. seems to me a startSession method solves the problem nicely. then the procedure is: create driver, inject your custom whatever-you-need, then call startSession to start the session.
[2014-03-13 13:41:01] dogarrhea: from my understanding, this is not code that I'm modifying, this is platform.java
[2014-03-13 13:41:07] dogarrhea: part of selenium i assume?
[2014-03-13 13:41:25] jleyba: dogarrhea you're mis-reading that code
[2014-03-13 13:41:35] jimevans: in reality, that's kinda what the current implementation does; i think there's a "startClient()" base method in the remote webdriver, which is intended to be overridden where necessary.
[2014-03-13 13:41:36] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-03-13 13:41:49] dogarrhea: what am I misreading?
[2014-03-13 13:42:11] jleyba: line 1 says it is Platform.VISTA if os is identified as "windows vista" OR "Windows Server 2008" OR "windows 7" OR "win7"
[2014-03-13 13:42:19] jleyba: that covers windows server and client versions
[2014-03-13 13:42:30] jleyba: (or I misunderstood what you are asking)
[2014-03-13 13:42:41] dogarrhea:  /**    * For versions of Windows that "feel like" Windows 8.    */   WIN8("Windows Server 2012", "windows 8", "win8") {
[2014-03-13 13:43:01] dogarrhea: if I understand English correctly, this seems to imply one browser for three strings.
[2014-03-13 13:43:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 761
[2014-03-13 13:43:28] dogarrhea: I may be misreading, but it sure is hard to understand what I should be reading from that comment.
[2014-03-13 13:43:44] jleyba: same thing... Selenium treats server 2012, windows 8, and win8 as the same effective platform
[2014-03-13 13:44:31] dogarrhea: so we really don't test on some desktop thing.. people in here were making fun of me for saying "your users are on windows server 2003?" instead of xp trollolol
[2014-03-13 13:44:42] dogarrhea: it turns out that selenium only tests on server?
[2014-03-13 13:44:54] dogarrhea: uh oh.
[2014-03-13 13:45:00] jleyba: jimevans: the problem is startClient is called from the base class.  so in java if you have an injected value that you need to reference from your custom startClient implementation, you have to stick it in DesiredCapabilities
[2014-03-13 13:45:18] jimevans: dogarrhea: i'm not sure i follow there.
[2014-03-13 13:45:19] jleyba: and then remember to remove it from DesiredCapabilities before the newSession request is actually sent to the server
[2014-03-13 13:45:21] jleyba: it's quite hacky
[2014-03-13 13:45:35] jimevans: jleyba: yep. i hear you.
[2014-03-13 13:45:54] p_l: dogarrhea: Windows 2012 = Windows 8, server build
[2014-03-13 13:46:15] jleyba: dogarrhea: if you have a grid with nodes on vista and server 2k8, and a new session comes in asking for "VISTA", you very well could end up with the request routed to either node
[2014-03-13 13:46:22] jleyba: since Selenium doesn't differentiate
[2014-03-13 13:46:38] p_l: from the pov of running a browser, I suspect the biggest difference might be that the server versions will have stricter default security policy on the browser
[2014-03-13 13:46:44] jleyba: but Selenium will run on many different windows flavors
[2014-03-13 13:46:53] p_l: which is something you're supposed to setup before running it as a test node
[2014-03-13 13:47:01] dogarrhea: the jenkins plugin specifies server build only.
[2014-03-13 13:47:06] jimevans: dogarrhea: the platform enum used to have two values, XP and VISTA. they didn't really mean "windows xp" and "windows vista". they meant "windows versions that don't implement UAC" and "windows versions that do implement UAC", respectively.
[2014-03-13 13:47:17] dogarrhea: and I look for desiredcapabilities to see what I can specify and it turns out only server.
[2014-03-13 13:47:44] dogarrhea: jebus...
[2014-03-13 13:47:56] jimevans: who wrote the jenkins plugin? i don't know the answer to that. it's not "the selenium project's" code, though. i know that much.
[2014-03-13 13:48:14] lukeis: DarkRift: ^  :)
[2014-03-13 13:48:21] dogarrhea: well, this platform.java thing seems to be selenium code.
[2014-03-13 13:48:48] jleyba: dogarrhea: ok, so you get back a set of capabilities
[2014-03-13 13:48:50] dogarrhea: i am quite disappointed.  Another thing to tell the group tomorrow. We are testing your appplication on server 2003 etc.

[2014-03-13 13:48:56] jleyba: in it, it says platform == Platform.VISTA
[2014-03-13 13:49:20] jleyba: that means, Selenium has identified the platform as a VISTA-like Windows flavor (e.g. with UAC as jimevans pointed out)
[2014-03-13 13:49:48] dogarrhea: I will need to talk with sauce about various windows updates that need to be installed
[2014-03-13 13:50:04] dogarrhea: and if they are possible to be installed on server windows
[2014-03-13 13:50:44] drharmony, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-03-13 13:50:57] jleyba: is this really a problem?
[2014-03-13 13:51:35] dogarrhea: jleyba, there was at one point in chrome, a bug with a certain windows update that caused blue screen so yes.
[2014-03-13 13:51:36] jleyba: there are very very very few differences b/w Firefox on Linux and Windows (as far as WebDriver is concerned).  I'd be surprised if there are any meaningful differences b/w Windows Server/Consumer
[2014-03-13 13:52:14] jleyba: what windows update/version of chrome?
[2014-03-13 13:52:29] dogarrhea: let me call my former colleague
[2014-03-13 13:52:48] dogarrhea: it happened when using the sprint.com support chat widget.
