[2014-01-04 16:15:53] therealfakemoot: also: there's a Keys module somewhere in there that has things you can use
[2014-01-04 16:17:11] also: therealfakemoot: where is "in there"?
[2014-01-04 16:17:45] therealfakemoot: also: in the selenium bindings for your language
[2014-01-04 16:18:56] also: therealfakemoot: right, but i don't see why this should need to be in the bindings
[2014-01-04 16:19:44] therealfakemoot: also: in the Python bindings, you import selenium.common.whatever.Keys, and pass Keys.ENTER or Keys.CONTROL to send_keys()
[2014-01-04 16:19:53] therealfakemoot: also: so I'm assuming that the other languages have similar mechanisms.
[2014-01-04 16:20:09] also: right, but it would be Keys.COMMAND if I were driving a mac browser
[2014-01-04 16:20:21] therealfakemoot: right
[2014-01-04 16:20:28] also: the server must know the platform of the driver, so it seems like i should be able to just say "the select all" key chord, and the server can select the right one
[2014-01-04 16:20:31] therealfakemoot: Check the module's contents for those keys
[2014-01-04 16:20:42] therealfakemoot: Maybe Selenium isn't that smart
[2014-01-04 16:20:56] therealfakemoot: I have no clue. I was just trying to give you a lead
[2014-01-04 16:20:59] also: it seems like such an obvious thing
[2014-01-04 16:21:01] therealfakemoot: but you seem to know a bit already
