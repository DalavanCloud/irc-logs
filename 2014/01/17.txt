[2014-01-17 12:09:47] jimevans: not especially. i've used them to let her travel with me last year, to BOS and SEA.
[2014-01-17 12:10:27] dimacus: $1,300
[2014-01-17 12:10:42] jimevans: like i said, a large difference.
[2014-01-17 12:10:51] dimacus: on kayak per person… that's actually cheaper than what i'm gonna be paying to go to kiev in feb
[2014-01-17 12:12:06] jimevans: so if sfdc won't sponsor my attendance, then no, i won't be going. if they will, the answer is maybe, but it depends on what i can afford.

[2014-01-17 15:14:18] phasze: anyone know of something like sikuli but can be integrated with grid?
[2014-01-17 15:14:20] tosh0: jimevans: Why WebDriver implementations(ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver ..etc) don't have method executeScript() ? It is a public method implemented in RemoteWebDriver.. and all these classes simply extend it.. Why this method is not visible in them
[2014-01-17 15:14:39] tosh0: so I have to cast ChromeDriver to JavascriptExecutor in order to expose this method
[2014-01-17 15:14:40] tosh0: ??
[2014-01-17 15:14:58] tosh0: maybe it's rather noobie Java question but it got me puzzled
[2014-01-17 15:15:18] jimevans: tosh0: because it's possible to have a driver that doesn't implement executeScript.
[2014-01-17 15:15:40] jimevans: while it's true that all of the current implementations do, it's not a requirement.
[2014-01-17 15:15:51] tosh0: yes I understand this
[2014-01-17 15:15:58] tosh0: but code-wise where is it specified
[2014-01-17 15:16:00] tosh0: to make it hidden
[2014-01-17 15:16:06] jimevans: that's why you code to the interface (WebDriver, JavascriptExecutor) and not to the implementation.
[2014-01-17 15:16:09] fatguylaughing, quitting. (Quit: fatguylaughing)
[2014-01-17 15:16:28] jimevans: WebDriver is an interface. it doesn't include executeScript() as one of its methods
[2014-01-17 15:16:57] bluescreen10, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-17 15:17:04] jimevans: RemoteWebDriver (and subclasses) is an *implementation* of that interface, that may (and in fact does) implement other interfaces, like JavascriptExecutorl
[2014-01-17 15:17:23] tosh0: oh I get it
[2014-01-17 15:17:32] tosh0: so if I create ChromeDriver as WebDriver (interface)
[2014-01-17 15:17:35] tosh0: I don't expose it
[2014-01-17 15:17:37] jimevans: correct
[2014-01-17 15:17:40] tosh0: but if I use it as ChromeDriver directly
[2014-01-17 15:17:45] tosh0: I would get it as it is implemented
[2014-01-17 15:17:49] jimevans: yes.
[2014-01-17 15:17:54] tosh0: I see now
[2014-01-17 15:17:59] tosh0: thank you very much!
[2014-01-17 15:18:09] jimevans: but you should continue to use the interface, and cast to other interfaces as necessary.
[2014-01-17 15:18:27] tosh0: right.. I just wanted to understand why it wasn't there
[2014-01-17 15:18:34] jimevans: cool. glad to help.

[2014-01-17 15:27:18] jimevans: that contains my changes to implement the remaining mouse methods
[2014-01-17 15:29:03] jimevans: when implement those, i can call my new implementation for webdriver.atoms.inject.action.mouseMove with no issues in the uncompressed case.
[2014-01-17 15:29:41] jimevans: when i use the compiled atoms in the phone driver case, i call webdriver.atoms.inject.action.mouseMove(null, 100, 100, null, null), and i get the error mentioned earlier.
