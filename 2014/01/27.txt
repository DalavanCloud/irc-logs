[2014-01-27 04:35:11] jarib: barancev: lol, is that your advice for everything these days? implement a wrapper
[2014-01-27 04:35:50] barancev: sure, I'm preparing to selenium camp where I'm going to talk about wrappers :)
[2014-01-27 04:36:30] barancev: but honestly it is the most natural way to add features like highlighting or logging
[2014-01-27 04:37:18] Cliff123: is there maybe an example somewhere? Or am I the first one who wants highlighting? ^^

[2014-01-27 04:50:42] barancev: jarib: Firefox 27 is tomorrow :)
[2014-01-27 04:50:51] jarib: oh, that's timely

[2014-01-27 04:51:01] Cliff123: jarib: then what is it? For me it looks like a missing dependency. I don't use the standalone version.

[2014-01-27 06:44:58] Moz: Hi all. Is it possible to install Selenium ona  linux server which has no GUI and control it via python for a small web scraping project including interpreting javascript?
[2014-01-27 06:45:09] apollo13: Moz: yes
[2014-01-27 06:45:30] Moz: apollo13: Great thank you, I'll try and scour the docs and demos to see how to do that.
[2014-01-27 06:45:33] apollo13: although there might be better approaches to it :)
[2014-01-27 06:45:54] tsyg_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-27 06:45:58] apollo13: I'd also take a look at http://phantomjs.org/
[2014-01-27 06:46:06] Moz: apollo13: I have written a system in python which works fine apart from on one page where the page requires some javascript processing to redirect the browser to a dynamically changing page
[2014-01-27 06:46:28] Moz: apollo13: Great thanks. That can process js as a library plugin for python?
[2014-01-27 06:47:22] Moz: apollo13: Oh I see it's a scriptable javascript thingy. Thanks Ill check that out as well.
[2014-01-27 06:47:44] apollo13: I think there are some python libs for it, I know not much about it though
[2014-01-27 06:48:01] apollo13: for selenium you'd probably at least need a vnc/xserver
[2014-01-27 06:48:10] apollo13: eg http://www.installationpage.com/selenium/how-to-run-selenium-headless-firefox-in-ubuntu/
[2014-01-27 06:48:30] simonstewart: apollo13: if you're using phantomjs, I think you can get away without it
[2014-01-27 06:50:10] apollo13: I think so too, but you might need qt iirc, which might be hard to install depending on the system^^
[2014-01-27 06:51:31] jimevans: the phantomjs executable *should* be statically linked so as to require no external prerequisites.

I've not really looked into why sometimes you need to and sometimes you don't, nor will I as I'm generally impersonating a user who has to click in. Just give it a shot :)

[2014-01-27 07:17:02] preinheimer: Dave_B_: I have clicked before entering the data, what I'm seeing is that the action doesn't actually get translated into the python code that's being run, the python is just finding the element by ID, CSS, or XPath.

[2014-01-27 08:04:56] jimevans: jarib: i can speak for .NET in that passing native events in the capabilities object to the firefox driver constructor has no effect.
[2014-01-27 08:05:10] jimevans: it is assumed that you set it in the profile for that.
[2014-01-27 08:05:15] jarib: 100% sure?
[2014-01-27 08:05:22] jarib: cause disabling it in ruby doesn't take
[2014-01-27 08:05:26] jimevans: i'm looking at the code.
[2014-01-27 08:05:27] jarib: i need to also set it in the capability
[2014-01-27 08:05:53] jimevans: there is no constructor in .net that allows both a profile and a capabilities object.
[2014-01-27 08:05:54] jarib: maybe it's more of a firefoxdriver issue
[2014-01-27 08:05:57] jarib: ah
[2014-01-27 08:06:24] jimevans: and when you pass a capabilities object it's assumed you include a profile capability (or you'll get a default one)
[2014-01-27 08:06:40] jimevans: maybe that's improper, but that's the api for .NET  at present.
[2014-01-27 08:07:49] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-27 08:07:58] jarib: so if you pass capabilities, you will look for a profile there
[2014-01-27 08:08:05] jimevans: jarib: yep
[2014-01-27 08:08:48] jarib: so i could do caps.put("nativeEvents", true); caps.put(PROFILE, profileWithNativeEventsDisabled);
[2014-01-27 08:08:52] jarib: or similar
[2014-01-27 08:09:15] jarib: and then it's left to the firefoxdriver to decide

[2014-01-27 08:38:12] FireArrow: Evening folks. I have a program that uses Selenium for automated fetching of data from a website. Anyone knows why driver.findElement(By.id(formId)); works great in Linux, but fails with a NotFoundException in Windows? I'm using the HtmlUnitDriver.
[2014-01-27 08:38:18] Dave_B_: easier than a plugin, but if your test suite grows you'll have repitition

[2014-01-27 08:45:10] jarib: that is, if you want to disable native events on windows, you need to set the capability (or maybe even both, if you pass a custom profile)

[2014-01-27 08:58:00] jarib: the problem now, is that if you disable it *only* in the profile, it won't have any effect, you still get native events
[2014-01-27 08:59:01] jarib: the patch in #4478 suggests the client should ensure consistency by overriding the profile value with whatever is set in caps

[2014-01-27 09:02:12] barancev|2: we check preferences, but the capability sets this preference in wdSessionStoreService.prototype.configureCapabilities_ so it has higher priority, right?

[2014-01-27 10:12:16] jarib: the extension already reads the profile prefs
[2014-01-27 10:13:27] jimevans: yeah, so maybe anything that is set through capabilities shouldn't *also* be settable via profile setting?
[2014-01-27 10:14:12] jarib: that's what we're discussing
[2014-01-27 10:14:31] jarib: but we should notify users that we're removing the ability to set it through the profile
[2014-01-27 10:14:37] jimevans: jarib: yeah, i know. :)
[2014-01-27 10:14:52] jarib: and the loudest and clearest way of doing it is to fail POST /session in the extension
[2014-01-27 10:15:12] simonstewart: ato: because there are systems that want to define the session id
[2014-01-27 10:15:18] jarib: (if profile prefs are found, or at least found to be inconcistent with the caps)

[2014-01-27 10:17:46] jleyba: expose a method for it off of FirefoxProfile or options or w/e
[2014-01-27 10:17:49] jimevans: very similar to IEOptions or ChromeOptions.

[2014-01-27 10:18:10] simonstewart: ok
[2014-01-27 10:18:33] simonstewart: The problem is that it's really useful for the capabilities to be loosely defined

[2014-01-27 10:20:50] jimevans: simonstewart: the strongly-typed options class should have an addAdditionalOption or addExperimentalOption method for that purpose.

[2014-01-27 10:21:29] simonstewart: Right. So I'm not sure I see where the problem is
[2014-01-27 10:21:32] jleyba: it should all be presented through a strongly typed API
[2014-01-27 10:21:42] simonstewart: jleyba: agreed. I've no problem with the strongly typed options
[2014-01-27 10:22:04] jimevans: but that way, the client language can trap for "known" key names saying "hey, dumbass, there's already a method for setting this option, use it instead"
[2014-01-27 10:22:12] simonstewart: But the capabilities are designed the way they are to give us wriggle room
[2014-01-27 10:23:56] jleyba: simonstewart: I think we're in agreement, just dancing around it.  i have no problem with json for the underlying representation.  I'm just against DesiredCapabilities in the user facing API

[2014-01-27 10:24:00] barancev|2: jleyba: stronly typed API breaks ability to add extra capabilities like e.g. saucelabs does
[2014-01-27 10:24:25] jleyba: barancev|2: that's their problem if they can't handle an API change
[2014-01-27 10:24:26] simonstewart: Ah. I've no problem with a complement to DesiredCaps in the user-facing APIs, but I'd like them to be a choice
[2014-01-27 10:24:32] jleyba: (I'm not talking about changing the protocol, just API)
[2014-01-27 10:25:02] simonstewart: How would I set a random key that isn't supported by the option direcrly?
[2014-01-27 10:25:48] simonstewart: The same way we added the remote session id to make it easy to do the webdriver-backed selenium from rc?
[2014-01-27 10:26:25] jleyba: leave the API as it is for RemoteWebDriver.  Make that the "you know what you're doing" implementation
[2014-01-27 10:26:41] jleyba: But present simplified, strongly typed APIs for the concrete implementations
[2014-01-27 10:27:36] jimevans: simonstewart: if it were up to me, i'd have a method that allowed arbitrary key-value pairs [options.addAdditionalOption('foo', 'fooValue')], with a toCapabilities() method for converting (one-way).
[2014-01-27 10:27:58] barancev|2: it is essentially the same :)
[2014-01-27 10:28:30] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-27 10:29:10] jimevans: barancev|2: except, if you have 'options.setEnabledEvents()', and try to call 'options.addAdditionalOption("nativeEvents", true)', you throw an exception.
[2014-01-27 10:29:45] jimevans: err, setEnableNativeEvents()
[2014-01-27 10:30:01] jleyba: We can also clearly document that addAdditionalOptions has no guarantees that the key will stay in sync with the project
[2014-01-27 10:30:02] FireArrow: lukeis: just for completeness: Windows/Linux had nothing to do with it. The problem was that stored cookies wasn't correctly checked for expiry, and after a long time in use, the http header became to large

[2014-01-27 10:30:28] jimevans: *that's* what the options class buys you. strongly typed, don't have to guess at the key name.

[2014-01-27 11:03:23] barancev|2: that nobody want to break because it hits users
[2014-01-27 11:03:54] jimevans: no, i get why. i was just curious if there were a *technical* reason, like it had to be read at profile-load time, or some such.
[2014-01-27 11:03:58] jarib: jimevans: if they're exposed as capabilities, that proves there's not a technical reason - assuming the client doesn't pull them out from there and add set them in the profile..

[2014-01-27 14:28:04] jimevans: HowardwLo: well, i'm at a loss as to why it's not working. usually if it's working on one machine and not another, and the machines are similarly spec'ed, the problem pointed to is often zoom level of some kind.
[2014-01-27 14:29:17] jimevans: maybe turn off native events? i think with them on, firefox may be sensitive to the position of the physical mouse cursor (i.e., whether it's inside or outside the bounds of the browser window)
[2014-01-27 14:29:26] HowardwLo: jimevans: i see it hovering over the elements at blazing speed
[2014-01-27 14:29:46] HowardwLo: i don't think its giving the slow computer enough time to detect what pops up after hovering
[2014-01-27 14:30:18] HowardwLo: ok i'll try turning off native events
[2014-01-27 14:30:35] jimevans: but that's what i'm saying. those are the symptoms of the problem. "hover and disappear immediately"
