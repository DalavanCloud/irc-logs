[2014-01-02 06:47:56] jimevans: Todd: not even really started yet. announcing a date for selenium 3 at SeConf was a mistake, in my opinion.
[2014-01-02 06:49:07] jimevans: this is particularly so since the Bearded One has been out of commission for much of the latter half of 2013.
[2014-01-02 06:49:27] AutomatedTester: only one person agreed to that date...
[2014-01-02 06:49:40] jimevans: (by "out of commission" i mean "unable to work a ton on selenium/webdriver stuff")
[2014-01-02 06:50:32] jimevans: one of these days, people will learn that putting any kind of date stake in the ground means it's going to reflect badly if there's any miss.
[2014-01-02 06:50:48] ato: You'd think.
[2014-01-02 06:50:50] jimevans: which, btw, is one of the reasons MSFT is so tight-lipped about ship schedules.

[2014-01-02 08:42:02] nirvdrum: MacroMan: If this is a new project, you really should switch to the WebDriver APIs.
[2014-01-02 08:42:11] lukeis: ("css=a[href='/product/2']")

[2014-01-02 08:43:36] nirvdrum: I'm unfamiliar with that.  But you're using a legacy API.  It's still supported so we don't leave existing users behind.  But it has no future.

[2014-01-02 08:44:38] MacroMan: nirvdrum, It's what's in the current documentation for Yii. I'm sure Yii will catch up at some point and move to the new API.
[2014-01-02 08:44:40] barancev: win7x64, py 2.7
[2014-01-02 08:44:50] lukeis: you should be able to ignore it, it's a artifact of the testing structure not fully being clean
[2014-01-02 08:45:23] barancev: do you mean installation was sucessfull?
[2014-01-02 08:45:43] nirvdrum: MacroMan: That's going to be a lot of rewriting . . .
[2014-01-02 08:45:44] barancev: or do you mean we have to fix rake to ignore it?
[2014-01-02 08:46:01] lukeis: we have 'template' files for the tests and replace the imports etc. when tests are run it tries to compile the template file too… which fails as you see, but the error is ignored and everything should have worked as intended

[2014-01-02 12:20:06] detronizator_: about what to do when a sendKey is used with "input\n" on an INPUT tag in a form
[2014-01-02 12:20:30] detronizator_: it was NYE, so I assumed it won't get answered for a while :)
[2014-01-02 12:20:42] detronizator_: I have checked the W3C specs
[2014-01-02 12:20:47] detronizator_: and nothing is said about that scenario
[2014-01-02 12:21:13] detronizator_: did a couple of tests on the FF driver and figured that FF does try to wait for a page load if such an action causes a page load
[2014-01-02 12:21:21] detronizator_: BUT it's not consistent: sometimes it just doesn't wait
[2014-01-02 12:21:23] AutomatedTester: you should convert \n to keys.ENTER and then send a Enter

[2014-01-02 12:22:12] detronizator_: but I feel like this kind of stuff would need to be "defined" somewhere/somehow
[2014-01-02 12:22:28] AutomatedTester: detronizator_: users should do their own waiting, we make a best guess and then its not consistent what that guess is
[2014-01-02 12:22:32] detronizator_: and wondered if there was something written, given chrome and ff seem to behave the same
[2014-01-02 12:22:55] AutomatedTester: I am working on user inputs at the moment so will make a note
[2014-01-02 12:22:56] detronizator_: AutomatedTester: I have sort of figured that now - I guess I'll do the same

[2014-01-02 15:03:46] apollo13: AutomatedTester: wonder if that applies to html too: Using setAttribute() to modify certain attributes, most notably value in XUL, works inconsistently, as the attribute specifies the default value. To access or modify the current values, you should use the properties. For example, use elt.value instead of elt.setAttribute('value', val).

[2014-01-02 15:05:22] apollo13: Because the value attribute defines the initial value of the element, while the value property is the actual value.
[2014-01-02 15:05:22] apollo13: After the element is created, there's no point in setting the value attribute, since it does pretty much nothing.
