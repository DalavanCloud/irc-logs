[2014-01-15 06:32:46] AutomatedTester: slimerjs is just a XUL app with a gecko backend
[2014-01-15 06:34:04] detronizator_: If slimerjs has full api compatibility with phantonjs
[2014-01-15 06:34:28] detronizator_: It should be "easy" as running ghost driver with slimer
[2014-01-15 06:34:49] detronizator_: Though I highly doubt slimer supports everything phantomjs apibsupport
[2014-01-15 06:35:16] detronizator_: Ghostdriver is written using every bit of phantomjs
[2014-01-15 06:35:52] detronizator_: So maybe marionette is a better way to go...
[2014-01-15 06:35:54] AutomatedTester: that explains a lot
[2014-01-15 06:36:21] detronizator_: But checking out ghost driver source and trying is very easy

[2014-01-15 08:02:42] dimacus: thought of thatâ€¦ i'll let them (sys admins) control the keys to the kingdom on the proxy, and they will only white list the build boxes and nothing elseâ€¦ this way they can sleep well in their paranoia and we have a compromise

[2014-01-15 08:04:05] nirvdrum: dimacus: Sounds like it's a battle you've already lost.  But you can subnet and shape traffic over a VPN link, too.  All with the added benefit of not trying to whitelist IPs and opening up to spoofing attacks.
[2014-01-15 08:04:51] dimacus: nirvdrum:  yeah actually that's not a bad idea to tryâ€¦ subnet and vpnâ€¦ thanks i'll run that idea by them, totatlly didn't think about this idea

[2014-01-15 08:08:10] dimacus: well we did some work with EC2 before where we had a 1 way proxy setup, and had jenkins slave run on EC2â€¦ the JNPL did save the day with reverse proxy thenâ€¦ sadly selenium does not have JNPL or reverse proxy built inâ€¦ and i think it would be a waste of time to try and implement

[2014-01-15 09:27:57] jimevans: so do i really even need to call the defaultContent atom?
[2014-01-15 09:28:13] jimevans: i never use the returned id for the top-level frame.
[2014-01-15 09:28:15] *lukeis doesn't :)'
[2014-01-15 09:28:57] jleyba: jimevans: No, if you track the current dom window outside the atoms
[2014-01-15 09:29:12] jimevans: then maybe that solves my problem. let me give it a shot.
[2014-01-15 09:29:24] jleyba: simonstewart: How do you feel about reworking the WebDriver constructors for Selenium 3.0?
[2014-01-15 09:29:36] simonstewart: ?
[2014-01-15 09:29:41] jleyba: pulling all of the nasty initialization logic into a builder/factory class
[2014-01-15 09:29:47] simonstewart: Ah. That
[2014-01-15 09:30:25] simonstewart: It's tempting. Would you still support the case where "new FirefoxDriver()" just works?
[2014-01-15 09:31:17] *lukeis is âˆ’1  to it. One can extend the classes to have lighter constructors / use builder-factories if they desire'

[2014-01-15 09:32:02] lukeis: jleyba's :)
[2014-01-15 09:32:35] jleyba: lukeis: RemoteWebDriver's init flow is really complicated and makes it difficult to work with
[2014-01-15 09:32:46] simonstewart: true story
[2014-01-15 09:32:53] simonstewart: It'd be nice to go back to basics.
[2014-01-15 09:33:01] simonstewart: I reckon we can refactor things already, thoguh
[2014-01-15 09:33:44] jleyba: the 3 things I think we should consider for the java API in Selenium 3:
[2014-01-15 09:33:47] jleyba: 1. cleaning up constructors
[2014-01-15 09:33:58] jleyba: 2. making the role interfaces more discoverable
[2014-01-15 09:34:29] jleyba: 3. hiding DesiredCapabilities (users should never have to refer to a wiki to find a list of configuration options)
[2014-01-15 09:35:12] simonstewart: 1: I'm fine with, provided the simple cases where people just want a driver instance is easy.
[2014-01-15 09:35:21] simonstewart: 2: Intrigued how we'd do that
[2014-01-15 09:35:46] simonstewart: 3: not convinced about hiding the capabilities, but I'm supportive of not making noobs read wikis

[2014-01-15 09:36:04] jleyba: :ask

[2014-01-15 09:36:08] simonstewart: no-one but us chickens
[2014-01-15 09:36:24] jimevans: i think for 3, the move toward a type-safe "options" class is a good step in the right direction.
[2014-01-15 09:36:33] jleyba: simonstewart: (2) would be the most difficult.
[2014-01-15 09:36:53] simonstewart: jimevans: Each driver having their own Options? Which can generate a capabilities?
[2014-01-15 09:37:03] glaksmono: i'm using capybara, and i wanted to customize the "google chrome" with extensions and some overrides.. any thoughts on how do i do that?
[2014-01-15 09:37:07] jleyba: The only two solutions I can think of are: a) using a Builder and always apply Augmenter to the built WebDriver (doesn't actually help discoverability)
[2014-01-15 09:37:17] jimevans: simonstewart: that's exactly what .NET does at the moment for chrome and IE.
[2014-01-15 09:37:23] simonstewart: noted.
[2014-01-15 09:37:29] jleyba: or b) bit the bullet and expose accessors for the specialized functionality off of the WebDriver interface
[2014-01-15 09:37:46] simonstewart: jleyba: b? Ugh. ugh. ugh
[2014-01-15 09:37:58] jleyba: Figured you'd have that reaction
[2014-01-15 09:38:03] jimevans: one of these days, i'm going to get around to creating a base abstract BrowserOptions class from which those will descend, further formalizing the contract.
[2014-01-15 09:38:12] simonstewart: I'm nothing if not predictable
[2014-01-15 09:38:16] jleyba: jimevans: +1
[2014-01-15 09:38:42] simonstewart: Interestingly, DesiredCapabilities was almost typed like that
[2014-01-15 09:38:53] jleyba: oh, there was a 4th thing I'd like to change in java!
[2014-01-15 09:38:56] simonstewart: Except it was going to become a massive dumping ground
[2014-01-15 09:39:08] simonstewart: 4th is?
[2014-01-15 09:39:12] jleyba: Using WebDriver after quit() should be an IllegalStateException.  None of this "is sessionId == null" nonsense we do now :)
[2014-01-15 09:39:29] simonstewart: jleyba: including multiple quit() calls?
[2014-01-15 09:39:50] simonstewart: Because we had to add that logic because Googlers, who are pretty sharp, called quit more than once
[2014-01-15 09:39:55] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-15 09:39:55] jleyba: quit() can be safe (and no-op if already quit)
[2014-01-15 09:40:02] simonstewart: jleyba: agreed, then :)
[2014-01-15 09:40:16] simonstewart: seen the wiki page?
[2014-01-15 09:40:19] jimevans: jleyba, simonstewart: it's a shame java doesn't have something like .NET's extension methods. i added a couple of those to the .NET support classes, so when you go "driver." in your IDE, you get things like .ExecuteScript as methods. they're not really implemented on IWebDriver, but they look like they are.
[2014-01-15 09:40:36] simonstewart: jimevans: agreed
[2014-01-15 09:40:42] timbo1, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-01-15 09:40:52] simonstewart: But we work with what we have

[2014-01-15 09:41:10] selbot2____: Jem - It's Amazing - Official Video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XDxhDbtDak&feature=youtube_gdata
[2014-01-15 09:41:55] jleyba: glaksmono: I have never used capybara so can't give you any specific advice, but WebDriver has an API to custom how Chrome should be started (specifying command line options, adding extensions, etc.)
[2014-01-15 09:42:08] simonstewart: jleyba: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ShippingSelenium3
[2014-01-15 09:42:32] simonstewart: Let's add 1 and 4
[2014-01-15 09:42:52] simonstewart: The desired capabilities thing is intriguing
[2014-01-15 09:43:10] simonstewart: But I'm terrified of having the base options grow like cancer
[2014-01-15 09:44:48] jimevans: the other challenge with the options piece is the remote case. for example, in the local IE case, you have a "service" class, specifying command-line options on IEDriverServer.exe, and an "options" class specifying browser-specific capabilities. for the remote case, you have to combine those into one capabilities object to pass over the wire.
[2014-01-15 09:45:02] jimevans: chrome is similar
[2014-01-15 09:45:03] alexglow, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2014-01-15 09:45:08] simonstewart: "Flags" and "Options"?
[2014-01-15 09:45:47] jimevans: i dunno yet. i've not fully baked my ideas on that.
[2014-01-15 09:46:38] Dave_B_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-15 09:47:00] jimevans: but i'm very much +1 on making the configuration of a browser driver type-safe rather than a huge bag of key-value pair goo that the user has to guess at what's correct for either the key or the value.
[2014-01-15 09:47:55] simonstewart: Definitely in favour of being user-focused
[2014-01-15 09:47:57] jleyba: What if we moved all the service configurations stuff into the Options API and handle it internally?
[2014-01-15 09:48:22] jimevans: that's certainly an approach, and might be the best one.

[2014-01-15 09:49:37] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-15 09:49:38] jleyba: The API can be setFoo(), setBar()
[2014-01-15 09:49:43] simonstewart: Right
[2014-01-15 09:50:52] jimevans: i guess i don't see how there's a semantic difference between "FooDriverBuilder builder = FooDriver.Builder()" vs. "FooDriverOptions options = new FooDriverOptions();"
[2014-01-15 09:50:57] glaksmono: jleyba, i'm using chrome driver.. i'd think capybara uses selenium underneath..
[2014-01-15 09:51:03] *lukeis cringes at getters and settersâ€¦. python 3.0 should contain no reference to the keyword 'get' :)'
[2014-01-15 09:51:25] simonstewart: lukeis: we do idiomatic things for each language

[2014-01-15 11:47:51] jleyba: if you can select the frame the element is in, you can use the interactions API to send keys to whatever element currently has focus
