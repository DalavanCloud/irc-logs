[2014-01-07 07:55:22] AutomatedTester: jimevans: which could also be got from document.querySelector('.myClass')
[2014-01-07 07:55:41] jimevans: yeah, but the point is, it maps to a javascript function hanging off document.
[2014-01-07 07:55:52] ato: Good point.

[2014-01-07 07:56:15] ato: nplatt: The answer to your question is that Selenium's class name locator will do what the browser does for document.getElementByClassName.

[2014-01-07 08:56:30] barancev|2: after page loading timeout we should stop loading

[2014-01-07 08:57:19] jleyba: I would expect to be able to catch the timeout error and continue with my test
[2014-01-07 08:57:36] barancev|2: that's exactly what 'stop' is here :)
[2014-01-07 08:57:58] barancev|2: otherwise the next command will be blocked until the page is loaded
[2014-01-07 08:58:09] jleyba: I meant I view the timeout error as "your page took longer to load than expected". The load should still be allowed to complete
[2014-01-07 08:58:13] jleyba: Ohhhh
[2014-01-07 08:58:23] jleyba: Shit

[2014-01-07 08:59:02] barancev|2: yes, if we don't stop page loading timeout is totally useless
[2014-01-07 08:59:27] barancev|2: I've added a test that demonstrates this
[2014-01-07 08:59:52] simonstewart: I feel like I've missed something here.
[2014-01-07 09:00:02] barancev|2: ave, simonstewart!
[2014-01-07 09:00:17] barancev|2: yes, I have a new topic to discuss :)
[2014-01-07 09:00:21] jleyba: I interpreted the page load timeout as "your page took longer to load than you expected, but we'll still let it finish loading"
[2014-01-07 09:00:24] simonstewart: ok
[2014-01-07 09:00:31] jleyba: but I guess the current implementation makes sense too
[2014-01-07 09:00:35] barancev|2: page loading strategies and page loading timeouts
[2014-01-07 09:00:36] simonstewart: moving to my next meeting. I may go offline

[2014-01-07 09:02:39] barancev|2: 1st question is what jleyba just asked: should we stop page loading after timeout is expired?
[2014-01-07 09:02:52] barancev|2: driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(..)
[2014-01-07 09:03:02] jimevans: i say no to that.
[2014-01-07 09:03:33] jimevans: i say we should stop waiting for the page to load, but not actually stop the page load process.
[2014-01-07 09:03:33] barancev|2: if we don't stop - the next command will be blocked, because loading is still continues
[2014-01-07 09:03:46] zeljkof, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-07 09:03:52] simonstewart: I think we use that exception as a warning that the page has loaded, not to stop loading itself
[2014-01-07 09:03:56] barancev|2: (at least in the current firefox driver implementation)
[2014-01-07 09:04:00] jimevans: barancev|2: that's a browser-specific implementation detail
[2014-01-07 09:04:16] zeljkof, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-07 09:04:34] barancev|2: so, stopping y timeout is useless because there is no way to continue running commands
[2014-01-07 09:04:50] barancev|2: there is no driver.navigate().stop()
[2014-01-07 09:05:01] barancev|2: is it worth to introduce this method?
[2014-01-07 09:05:05] jimevans: for example, IE will stop waiting, but the browser will continue, and yes, the driver will continue to receive commands and execute them happily.
[2014-01-07 09:05:34] jimevans: s/will continue/will continue loading the page/
[2014-01-07 09:05:35] simonstewart: (meeting time. will be mostly offline)
[2014-01-07 09:06:14] jimevans: so there's a bug in the firefox implementation if the firefox implementation isn't capable of doing that.
[2014-01-07 09:06:37] barancev|2: jimevans: yes, I agree, if we allow commands without blocking on page loading wait -- it would be a solution too
[2014-01-07 09:07:17] barancev|2: but I leave it to simonstewart to decide on this firefox behavior -- is it a but or a feature :)
[2014-01-07 09:08:05] barancev|2: I guess why it is implemented with blocking
[2014-01-07 09:08:26] barancev|2: if we allow command execution while a page is loading there is a risk to lose the DOM

[2014-01-07 09:13:23] jleyba_: barancev|2: in the firefox driver, can we toggle a bit to control whether we should continue waiting for the page to load?
[2014-01-07 09:13:57] jleyba_: timeout expires: clear the wait bit.  detect new page load (webdriver initiated or not): reset the bit

[2014-01-07 09:15:11] barancev|2: jleyba_: should we wait until a page is in 'complete' state when a command (e.g. findElement) is received?
[2014-01-07 09:15:16] jimevans: jleyba_: what did you decide about the defaultContent atom change?
[2014-01-07 09:15:50] jleyba_: jimevans: I'm going to roll it back, but will fold that in with other changes I need to push
[2014-01-07 09:16:37] jimevans: actually, i can roll it back if you want. i can also redo my investigation on what it was breaking in my other code.\
[2014-01-07 09:16:58] jleyba_: barancev|2: if the wait bit is set, yes wait for "complete". Otherwise, no
[2014-01-07 09:21:38] barancev|2: ah, I see. yes, it is possible to implement this way, but let's take simonstewart's blessing
[2014-01-07 09:22:20] jimevans: sigh. slow build is slow.

[2014-01-07 12:42:18] jimevans: having trouble with webdriver.atoms.inject.executeScript, and i just want to know where to start looking.
[2014-01-07 12:42:49] jimevans: if i run the unit test in the browser, it works just fine.

[2014-01-07 12:45:28] jleyba__: probably https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/javascript/atoms/inject.js#186
[2014-01-07 12:45:37] jleyba__: (try commenting that out)

[2014-01-07 12:47:50] eanxgeek, changing nick to eanxgeek|log.
[2014-01-07 12:48:27] jleyba__: When bot.inject.executeScript is given a window reference that is != its own window, it has to recompile the script
[2014-01-07 12:49:14] jleyba__: this ensure's the function has the correct scope when evaluate
[2014-01-07 12:49:18] jleyba__: evaluated*
[2014-01-07 12:50:20] jleyba__: Since you're working with a frame, my hunch is the frame's window isn't initialized yet
[2014-01-07 12:50:25] jleyba__: so the linked line triggers an error
[2014-01-07 12:50:45] jimevans: so timing? i'm pretty sure that's not the case.
[2014-01-07 12:52:15] jimevans: but i'll try it anyway.
[2014-01-07 12:54:52] jleyba__: this is windows phone right?  that should be similar to IE11 and have stack traces?
[2014-01-07 12:55:06] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-07 12:55:17] jimevans: it's more similar to IE10
[2014-01-07 12:55:34] jimevans: in fact, it *is* IE10
[2014-01-07 12:55:42] jimevans: (on windows phone)
[2014-01-07 12:55:54] jimevans: windows phone 8 == IE10
[2014-01-07 12:57:01] jleyba__: should still have stack traces
[2014-01-07 12:57:10] jimevans: and again, if i run the atoms tests in the browser (on the phone), they work.
[2014-01-07 12:57:17] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-01-07 12:58:35] jimevans: sure does.
[2014-01-07 12:59:02] jimevans: (he said with no small amount of surprise)

[2014-01-07 14:49:12] chrismcmahon: jimevans: IE10 in Selenium I mean, the element appears invisible to humans in IE10 also, just Selenium thinks it is visible.

[2014-01-07 14:50:23] jimevans: but for the report to be actionable, you'll need to provide a page that repros the problem (or url to the same)
[2014-01-07 14:50:46] jimevans: if you won't provide the html to run against, the report is worthless.

[2014-01-07 14:50:58] chrismcmahon: thanks jimevans yeah, it's all in a public test env with public tests failing
[2014-01-07 14:51:03] jimevans: (and yes, i meant "won't", not "can't")
[2014-01-07 14:52:08] jimevans: don't expect me to look at it for a couple of weeks at least. i'm totally swamped with other stuff.
[2014-01-07 14:53:46] chrismcmahon: jimevans:  what I don't have at the tip of my fingers is a super-short demo of the problem, just test results in the context of a Jenkins build running Cucumber tests against Sauce VMs.   That's all public though, and easy to point to, if it would be adequate.

[2014-01-07 14:55:22] jimevans: try to distill it down if you can. you have an element that you think doesn't do visibility correctly. make the page directly navigable to, and give a very simple script (doesn't matter the language) using the raw webdriver api
[2014-01-07 15:01:11] chrismcmahon: jimevans: I'll work one up.  If you want a quick look, hover on the blue "Selenium user" on this page to see text appear "Talk|contribs".  FF and Chrome rightly think "Talk|contribs" is not visible until after hovering, IE10 thinks they are always visible.  http://en.wikipedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Talk:Flow_QA

[2014-01-07 15:08:23] jimevans: stupid "IE5 quirks mode" totally breaks shit.

[2014-01-07 15:13:29] jimevans: jleyba__: if you're looking for a repro case for the injected atoms executeScript problem, you can run execute_script_test.html in IE10, see it pass, then open the F12 developer tools, and set the document mode to "IE5 quirks". you should get failures then.
