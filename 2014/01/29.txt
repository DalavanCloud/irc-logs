[2014-01-29 06:46:55] jimevans: polyvisual: well let me put a damper on your enthusiasm. (it's what i do) it's *mostly* fixed. there's an edge case where if the center of the element falls *exactly* on the border, we don't think the element needs scrolling, and the click may not be registered.
[2014-01-29 06:48:21] jimevans: if you run your example test case with the fixed IEDriverServer.exe, it'll work fine for all except the last checkbox, which, because of the chance way it gets scrolled, fits this bill.

[2014-01-29 08:05:47] jimevans: as an extension point. it would enable some nice things like a "browser dialog manager" for system-level dialogs that are out of scope for webdriver.
[2014-01-29 08:06:06] dimacus: what's preventing you from getting the pid?
[2014-01-29 08:06:20] jimevans: dimacus: nothing, except that we don't expose an API for it.
[2014-01-29 08:06:38] dimacus: ahhh
[2014-01-29 08:06:38] jimevans: i mean, *i* can get it, but we don't provide it to users anywhere.
[2014-01-29 08:07:37] simonstewart: For the IE driver
[2014-01-29 08:07:37] simonstewart: ?
[2014-01-29 08:07:45] jimevans: for any browser.
[2014-01-29 08:07:54] simonstewart: Cos the PID doesn't make a lot of sense for the multi-process browsers, right?
[2014-01-29 08:08:01] simonstewart: Chrome and Firefox
[2014-01-29 08:08:05] simonstewart: Maybe recent IE?
[2014-01-29 08:08:28] dimacus: acutally if we could get the PID or range of PIDs for a given test session, it would make the clean up post build so much more incredibly simple
[2014-01-29 08:08:46] dimacus: currently with Grid post IE build i have to do equivelent to "killall ie"
[2014-01-29 08:08:53] simonstewart: Assuming you're running tests on localhost
[2014-01-29 08:09:02] jimevans: it might. on windows, for example, i can always construct a callback for EnumWindows that says "give me a window with the known window class of the browser that belongs to the process id i provide"
[2014-01-29 08:09:03] dimacus: just in case there are orphaned ie windows
[2014-01-29 08:09:10] simonstewart: Which isn't necessarily true on grid
[2014-01-29 08:09:21] dimacus: simonstewart: no that's what i'm currently doing on grid
[2014-01-29 08:09:35] simonstewart: Because you're running everything on the grid server?
[2014-01-29 08:10:08] simonstewart: If you're doing that, the normal selenium server without a grid config should work
[2014-01-29 08:10:22] dimacus: nope, bc i'm writing a seperate plugin to help the grid manage nodes by taping into "after session" call via proxy extension
[2014-01-29 08:10:35] dimacus: and send "kill all ie" on the node which is a windows box vs hub which is centos
[2014-01-29 08:10:37] simonstewart: K
[2014-01-29 08:10:42] dimacus: but that's neither here nor there
[2014-01-29 08:10:55] dimacus: PIDs would be a delicious thing to have that's all
[2014-01-29 08:11:00] simonstewart: How the heck do I get the element that was click in FirefoxDriver.prototype.mouseClick
[2014-01-29 08:11:06] simonstewart: ?
[2014-01-29 08:11:11] simonstewart: It must be around here somewhere
[2014-01-29 08:11:23] jimevans: simonstewart: did you look behind the couch?
[2014-01-29 08:11:27] simonstewart: Yeah
[2014-01-29 08:11:39] jimevans: well, then i'm all out of ideas.
[2014-01-29 08:11:39] jimevans: :)
[2014-01-29 08:11:40] simonstewart: this.mouse implements wdIMouse.idl
[2014-01-29 08:12:21] simonstewart: Internally, the mouse tracks the location of the cursor
[2014-01-29 08:12:26] simonstewart: But it doesn't expose that information
[2014-01-29 08:12:29] jimevans: but seriously, i'm trying to think of decent answers to the "rude q&a" about limitations of webdriver.
[2014-01-29 08:12:30] simonstewart: (which is good)
[2014-01-29 08:12:39] simonstewart: jimevans: Where?
[2014-01-29 08:12:40] jimevans: i've got one for http status codes, and headers, etc.
[2014-01-29 08:12:45] jimevans: just in general.
[2014-01-29 08:12:45] simonstewart: Oh
[2014-01-29 08:13:11] dimacus: jimevans: btw if you were to ever add a pice of code that would write the IE session ID and PID of the IE to some /tmp text file, i would buy you a case of most expensive booze i could afford
[2014-01-29 08:13:47] jimevans: the other biggest hurdle i hear about as a limitation is "you can't handle system dialogs" (i.e., the "download file" case)
[2014-01-29 08:13:53] jimevans: which i agree, we shouldn't be doing.

[2014-01-29 08:14:54] jarib: dimacus: doensn't the fact that you're cleaning up IE processes yourself point to a problem with driver.quit(), not the lack of driver.getPid()?
[2014-01-29 08:15:13] jimevans: it's kinda nice be able to say, "hey, we don't do that, it's out of scope, but here's someone else who's tackling that problem"
[2014-01-29 08:15:21] simonstewart: agreed

[2014-01-29 08:16:37] jimevans: Dave_B_: there's not one.
[2014-01-29 08:16:42] dimacus: jarib: completely agreed, sadly i don't know enough of C++ yet to go and try to fix it, once i catch up i'll try to read through the code and figure out the edge case that causes it, in mean time it's work around city, which is equally sad

[2014-01-29 08:18:36] simonstewart: For whatever it is that's causing the IE windows to be left open
[2014-01-29 08:18:55] jimevans: dimacus: i'd be thoroughly interested in that too.
[2014-01-29 08:19:00] jimevans: (a repro case)
[2014-01-29 08:19:34] dimacus:  no sadly i don't, it seems to have it, i just noticed that after a week of not touching the nodes/grid after say 20 builds a day per node something happens
[2014-01-29 08:19:42] dimacus: where 1 IE window will not close on the quit()
[2014-01-29 08:20:08] jimevans: does the app in question open modal or popup windows (using showModalDialog or window.open)?
[2014-01-29 08:20:14] dimacus: after that it cascades down, and none of the ie windows close period until you have 30 IE windows opened at once, and box is no longer responsive (it's a vm)
[2014-01-29 08:20:49] dimacus: jimevans: no i don't think so, the app in question is Jasmine build which uses Ruby bindings to drive Webdriver app
[2014-01-29 08:21:27] jimevans: there used to be an edge case where modal dialogs didn't get closed before the windows that spawned them, which could lead to windows being left open (though i thought i'd fixed that).

[2014-01-29 08:21:58] jimevans: speaking of, is there any mileage to specifying an order to the window handles returned via getWindowHandles in the spec?
[2014-01-29 08:22:12] Dave_B_: I've a service running on each node that kills off idle browser windows - though I'm still not convinced it's not testers just failing to call quit() that was causing the problems. That said, I've no idea if it's still needed, haven't checked the logs in aaagggeeeessss
[2014-01-29 08:22:14] jimevans: we've always said no guaranteed order before, but it might be useful.
[2014-01-29 08:22:49] LiohAu: I have multiple questions about the Page Object Pattern, 1st. for each link/action I have a "go_to_{link}" or "do_{action}" method that usually returns the next Page object, so the last lines of these methods often looks like : "next_page = .. page creation .. ; wait.. ; return next_page"
[2014-01-29 08:22:58] jimevans: (the use case, for those wondering, is the quit case, to ensure that windows are closed in the correct order)
[2014-01-29 08:22:59] LiohAu: but how should I handle redirections ?
[2014-01-29 08:23:34] dimacus: Dave_B_: same here… i just do a blanket call to kill any IE, but also blanket call to kill chromedriver.exe, that sucker sometimes just does not want to quit post build. Have you noticed that?
[2014-01-29 08:23:35] jarib: dimacus: first thing would be to make 100% sure that driver.quit is always called at the end, whatever happens
[2014-01-29 08:23:56] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-29 08:24:09] Dave_B_: aye, chromedriver.exe seems to end up quite popular at times :)
[2014-01-29 08:24:12] dimacus: jarib: agreed, i'll start logging that… it's possible that the edge case is an aborted build were ruby bindings are sigterm before sending the quit
[2014-01-29 08:24:45] jimevans: LiohAu: return the page object for the last page after redirection. in your "wait for page to be present", you can poll for the proper url, or for an element to be present on the final destination page.

[2014-01-29 08:27:12] dimacus: jimevans: actually that is exacly the same issue i'm having

[2014-01-29 08:27:21] jimevans: and i'm inclined to expose the process id of the service process (chromedriver.exe, iedriverserver.exe, etc.), so that someone could roll their own if they need to.
[2014-01-29 08:27:43] jimevans: dimacus: that issue is dealing with the service process, not the browser process.
[2014-01-29 08:28:06] dimacus: i agree, i'm rolling it under the blanket "clean up" task
[2014-01-29 08:28:17] dimacus: bc killing chromderver.exe and iedriver.exe is part of that also
[2014-01-29 08:28:24] LiohAu: jimevans: So hw do you handle different destinations ? for example a login page can redirect you on the home page OR if you fail the authentication on the same page OR on another page (locked account for example ?)

[2014-01-29 08:28:53] dimacus: matter of a fact if I could get the PID of chromedriver.exe and iedriver.exe to kill them individually that would be 10x more useful than knowing the PID of browser
[2014-01-29 08:29:10] jimevans: LiohAu: you have multiple methods. if you're just exposing the link to click on to log in, that's not a page object; that's a page wrapper pattern.
[2014-01-29 08:29:23] dimacus: this way you can clean up an instance of chromedriver, even though you have multiple builds running at the same time without killing the other build which is mid-flight

[2014-01-29 08:30:25] LiohAu: jimevans: In my case the "login_button" thing would be private, and the "do_login" would be public and use the "login_button" internally, So I guess that it follows Page Object

[2014-01-29 08:31:37] jimevans: LiohAu: you need either (1) multiple login methods, (2) a parameter on your do_login method that tells it what type of login to expect, or (3) some sort of generics implementation like .NET would give you to let you specify what type of page to return.
[2014-01-29 08:31:49] simonstewart: Wondering whether I can delegate wdIMouse.click to it

[2014-01-29 08:58:04] jimevans: why wouldn't you have different conditions for "a valid user exists in the web application" and "a user exists with a locked account in the web application"?
[2014-01-29 08:58:45] jimevans: also, i'd only create your users through the ui for tests that explicitly test user creation via the ui.

[2014-01-29 08:59:26] LiohAu: For your first point, I will have the different conditions, sure
[2014-01-29 08:59:28] simonstewart: Anyone disagree?
[2014-01-29 08:59:53] jimevans: LiohAu: if you need to create users for other tests (that are not *explicitly* testing user creation) do it some other way (API, direct back-end manipulation, etc).
[2014-01-29 09:00:34] LiohAu: API involves that I can manipulate any data from the API which is not my case :(
[2014-01-29 09:00:44] LiohAu: "direct back-end manipulation" what do you mean ? :D
[2014-01-29 09:01:05] jimevans: and if you don't have an api to do it, your application developers need to be fired^h^h^h^h^h educated to expose such a thing as that's just good app development practice.
[2014-01-29 09:01:17] dimacus: simonstewart: flash cookies? why should we support 10 year old technology that no one uses anymore?

[2014-01-29 09:03:32] jimevans: of course, .NET has the built-in concept of events, with all the attendant plumbing, which makes that easy.

[2014-01-29 09:06:26] jimevans: LiohAu: so how does the web application actually manipulate data? how does it, say, create a user? presumably there's some database as the backing store where all users are kept. there must be some way to mimic that process and shove data into the database representing a new user.
[2014-01-29 09:07:08] jimevans: if nothing else, you can hand-craft an http request that posts to the web server that mimics what the web application does, but avoid firing up a full-browser stack.

[2014-01-29 09:30:00] barancev: simonstewart: is there a reason RemoteWebDriver exposes sessionId via a public method? why not restrict it to protected
[2014-01-29 09:30:44] simonstewart: Mainly so that tools that attempt to wrap around the remote webdriver can Do The Right Thing
[2014-01-29 09:30:59] simonstewart: Consider mapping sessionId to virtual machine
[2014-01-29 09:31:00] barancev: protected would be enouth
[2014-01-29 09:31:01] simonstewart: Or similar
[2014-01-29 09:31:08] barancev: enough
[2014-01-29 09:31:28] simonstewart: How would the example above work with just protected?
[2014-01-29 09:33:52] barancev: jimevans rejected providing a method to expose sessionId in C#. so I wondering do we need a public method in Java
[2014-01-29 09:34:28] barancev: should we make interfaces similar in Java and C#?
[2014-01-29 09:34:41] jimevans: i feel like session id is an implementation detail, and if people really really need it, they can subclass remotewebdriver.
[2014-01-29 09:35:05] barancev: I can agree with this point
[2014-01-29 09:36:09] jimevans: but there's something to be said for preferring composition over inheritance, so i can see both sides of the argument.
