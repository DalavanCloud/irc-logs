[2014-01-28 06:02:42] Ewaldo: Is knowing a programming language an absolute prerequisite for doing it?
[2014-01-28 06:03:47] Ewaldo: Im not super technical, but im pretty pc savvy.. I just got a list of 10.000 customers to segment and this seems an impossible task without automation :)
[2014-01-28 06:05:44] barancev: prerequisite for automation, yes. there is no mind-reading technology yes, and you have to explain to a robot what you need. in a language the robot understands
[2014-01-28 06:07:23] Ewaldo: I realize that some sort of programming would be necessary, however I was thinking someone might knew a way I could do this and could guide me in the right direction on how it could be done - or had done something similar and could show me how it could be done :)
[2014-01-28 06:08:22] Zeusdude: suggesting robot framework
[2014-01-28 06:08:54] barancev: yes, it is a good thing to start from
[2014-01-28 06:09:32] Ewaldo: I managed to program a key and macro recorder to do it manually using mouse and key clicks - and that would work if I only had 10.000 lines to look up, however, in the future i might get 100.000 and that would take weeks for it to finish :)
[2014-01-28 06:10:05] barancev: look for a better way to push this abount of data to the system
[2014-01-28 06:10:14] wilhelm: Note that the site you're using might get annoyed if you spam it 100 000 times in a row, though. :)
[2014-01-28 06:10:16] simonstewart: Right, so do we agree that we close chromedriver issues and point people at their bug tracker?
[2014-01-28 06:10:31] barancev: simonstewart: if only it is the driver issue
[2014-01-28 06:10:37] barancev: not a client lib
[2014-01-28 06:10:46] simonstewart: right
[2014-01-28 06:11:27] Ewaldo: I agree, they might find it less than pleasing that I look up data 100.000 times.. However, it would be over a longer period, in clusters :)
[2014-01-28 06:12:25] eagles0513875_: I officially love the IDE :D
[2014-01-28 06:13:38] barancev: Ewaldo: ask the site owner for a less painful interface -- e.g. a feature to import large amount of data
[2014-01-28 06:14:27] simonstewart: OK. It looks like we've reached some agreement on the project hosting
[2014-01-28 06:14:35] Ewaldo: They want a LOTof money for that though.. This form is free to use - so I was trying to figure out how to use this way :)
[2014-01-28 06:14:36] simonstewart: Finding it very hard to get started on triaging
[2014-01-28 06:15:11] barancev: eagles0513875_: it is not for long :)
[2014-01-28 06:15:18] eagles0513875_: barancev: what do you mean
[2014-01-28 06:15:45] ddary: simonstewart: looks like we keep the current setup, right?
[2014-01-28 06:15:45] barancev: soon you'll hit the limits
[2014-01-28 06:15:56] eagles0513875_: ? limits of what exactly
[2014-01-28 06:16:00] eagles0513875_: what should i look out for?
[2014-01-28 06:16:03] simonstewart: Right
[2014-01-28 06:16:51] ddary: simonstewart: I care mostly about dividing the end user documentation and the dev documentation
[2014-01-28 06:17:17] simonstewart: Yeah. I think that's a separate beast, but one we need to get on top of
[2014-01-28 06:17:47] Ewaldo: barancev: So this Robot framework, is it this: http://robotframework.org/ ?
[2014-01-28 06:17:48] barancev: eagles0513875_: you should follow this road yourself :)
[2014-01-28 06:17:54] barancev: Ewaldo: yes
[2014-01-28 06:18:25] wilhelm: Ewaldo: It should take you less time to learn some basic hacking than manually look it up 100 000 times, though. Export your Excel sheet to some robot-readable format. Iterate through the list. Collect data. Find some way to push it back in. Judging by the service, you may not even need a browser for this.
[2014-01-28 06:18:31] barancev: eagles0513875_: beware test maintenance
[2014-01-28 06:18:31] eagles0513875_: barancev: ok :)

[2014-01-28 08:48:32] jimevans: why do we expose the session id in some language bindings?
[2014-01-28 08:49:05] lukeis: it's technically "private" in python… but nothing is private in python… same with java ;) (you can get it if you really want it)
[2014-01-28 08:49:27] lukeis: i've had a need for it though, so i like being able to get it

[2014-01-28 08:50:12] lukeis: when running against saucelabs, the link to the job is the sessionid (although i believe there's other ways to get it )
[2014-01-28 08:50:37] jimevans: i strongly dislike having it exposed. it's an implementation detail, and exposing it breaks encapsulation (imo)
[2014-01-28 08:51:10] lukeis: i will gladly use reflection to extract the information if i have to ;)
[2014-01-28 08:51:27] ato: It's not possible to not expose it in a language like Python though.

[2014-01-28 08:54:01] ato: Not the WebDriver interface though.
[2014-01-28 08:54:14] lukeis: can they sub-class Remote and get it? or is it truly private?
[2014-01-28 08:54:18] ato: RemoteWebDriver also exposes a few other things that are specific to the class.
[2014-01-28 08:54:30] jimevans: lukeis: it's protected, so a subclass would have access to it.
[2014-01-28 08:54:44] lukeis: then that's their solution… closed / working as intended
[2014-01-28 08:54:59] ato: Yes, I don't think we should mandate it.
[2014-01-28 08:55:07] ato: It's a language particular detail IMO.

[2014-01-28 08:55:16] jimevans: well, yeah.
[2014-01-28 08:55:22] jimevans: the bug specifies as such.
[2014-01-28 08:55:30] jimevans: it's an inconsistency between language bindings.
[2014-01-28 08:55:36] lukeis: not like random users get to specify requirements ;)
[2014-01-28 08:55:40] ato: Not really.
[2014-01-28 08:55:51] lukeis: python has it technically as 'private'
[2014-01-28 08:55:56] ato: What RemoteWebDriver promises to deliver is a way to make the WebDriver interface work, well, remotely.
[2014-01-28 08:55:56] lukeis: (by naming convention)
[2014-01-28 08:56:31] lukeis: err, maybe not
[2014-01-28 08:56:32] ato: Doesn't mean we have to unify the rest of the interface of the Remote* classes.

[2014-01-28 15:13:03] AutomatedTester: remember the conformance tests for the spec are in python so there will be a lot of companies running the python bindings tests for us
[2014-01-28 15:13:54] lukeis: only the python + firefox actually have a decent pass rate (2 expected failures that need to be marked as such)

[2014-01-28 15:14:49] lukeis: http://modern.ie/
[2014-01-28 15:15:11] jimevans: +1 for modern.ie

[2014-01-28 15:16:55] lukeis: we can't run python on it
[2014-01-28 15:17:24] lukeis: we can run browsers, but the point is natively testing python bindings :)
[2014-01-28 15:17:35] jimevans: combine modern.ie with https://github.com/jimevans/windows-selenium-dev-setup and you've got a read-for-development environment in windows.

[2014-01-28 15:55:28] jimevans: mainly because i'm not happy with the logging apis (client-side or server-side) and neither is simonstewart.
[2014-01-28 15:55:41] jleyba: logging apis are a pain

[2014-01-28 15:56:46] AutomatedTester: I wonder if we will see the logging api soon
[2014-01-28 15:56:53] AutomatedTester: maybe before end of February
[2014-01-28 15:57:03] jimevans: could be...
[2014-01-28 15:57:15] jleyba: I think we over thought the logging API
[2014-01-28 15:57:34] lukeis: well, we are using the current implementation (decently) in selendroid...
[2014-01-28 15:58:05] lukeis: and phantomjs has it now too
[2014-01-28 15:58:25] jleyba: The java implementation is terrifying
[2014-01-28 15:58:27] AutomatedTester: apparently Simon has changed it

[2014-01-28 16:00:47] lukeis: which contains logging from selendroid

[2014-01-28 16:04:10] RodEsp: Hello
[2014-01-28 16:04:33] jimevans: RodEsp: hi
[2014-01-28 16:05:01] RodEsp: I have a little bit of a weird question for you guys.
[2014-01-28 16:05:39] jimevans: go ahead
[2014-01-28 16:05:49] RodEsp: Basically, I would like to know why the selenium server exits with code 0 (that is to say, it says everything is alright) when it encounters an error such as this:
[2014-01-28 16:05:51] RodEsp: Unhandled error with selenium: NoSuchElementError: no such element
[2014-01-28 16:06:23] detronizator_: just in case you use PhantomJSDriver and wonder what went wrong: http://ivandemarino.me/2014/01/phantomjs_196vs197/
[2014-01-28 16:06:32] jimevans: i'm not aware that the server *does* exit when it encounters such an exception.
[2014-01-28 16:07:12] RodEsp: detronizator_: I'm testing on Chrome
[2014-01-28 16:07:24] jimevans: your webdriver code may not handle it, but i'm pretty sure the server will soldier on.
[2014-01-28 16:08:03] detronizator_: RodEsp: was more of a "general FYI", given that the topic reached this room at some point in the last few days
[2014-01-28 16:08:06] detronizator_: carry on...
[2014-01-28 16:08:14] RodEsp: Ok thanks :)
[2014-01-28 16:08:15] jimevans: let me ask it this way, RodEsp: why would you expect the server to return a non-zero exit code?
[2014-01-28 16:09:14] selbot2: 04Bug mash! Open issues: 759
[2014-01-28 16:09:24] lukeis, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-28 16:09:31] RodEsp: jimevans: What do you mean? My WebDriver isn't failing. The error is happening as expected, when the element selenium is trying to find doesn't actually exist on the page it's on.
[2014-01-28 16:10:05] jimevans: okay, and the server is still running until you cause it to exit, right?
[2014-01-28 16:10:08] RodEsp: Well, since the server is encountering an error shouldn't it exit with a code of 1 or something like that? As far as I know an exit code of 0 means a successful completion of whatever task is going on.
[2014-01-28 16:10:30] RodEsp: Hmm... I don't think it is, but let me check real quick.
[2014-01-28 16:11:17] jimevans: also, are you using java or another language binding?
[2014-01-28 16:12:01] RodEsp: Nope, just plain ol' JS.
[2014-01-28 16:12:07] jimevans: ah. javascript.
[2014-01-28 16:12:29] jimevans: via node?
[2014-01-28 16:14:07] RodEsp: Yup.
[2014-01-28 16:14:18] RodEsp: Hmm... you're right... the server keeps on running.
[2014-01-28 16:14:23] RodEsp: My apologies.
[2014-01-28 16:14:45] jimevans: it doesn't happen often (that i'm right).
[2014-01-28 16:15:23] RodEsp: What shutdowns is the cucumber process that's running the tests.
[2014-01-28 16:15:30] RodEsp: shuts down**
[2014-01-28 16:15:59] RodEsp: Well, gentleman, thanks. I will quietly duck out with my tail between my legs.
[2014-01-28 16:15:59] jimevans: and *that* is what i'd expect to return a non-zero exit code.
[2014-01-28 16:16:07] jimevans: no worries.
