[2014-01-30 06:39:10] jimevans: which language binding, jugglinmike?
[2014-01-30 06:39:36] barancev: and... there is Safari the browser :)

[2014-01-30 06:43:49] jugglinmike: jimevans: If you don't mind, I have one other question: I've never seen a separate Selenium driver for Firefox. Does that mean that I can write tests in *any* language binding for Firefox, and expect them to run by using the system's Firefox installation directly?
[2014-01-30 06:44:54] jimevans: jugglinmike: as long as it talks the webdriver json wire protocol, yeah. but what's wrong with the existing driver for firefox?
[2014-01-30 06:44:56] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: yup
[2014-01-30 06:45:09] jimevans: oh.
[2014-01-30 06:45:11] jimevans: nvm
[2014-01-30 06:45:28] *jimevans needs lessons in reading comprehension. or more coffee.'
[2014-01-30 06:45:33] jugglinmike: jimevans: Awesome! I think that may be a nicer solution in the mean time
[2014-01-30 06:45:45] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: whats the issue you are having?
[2014-01-30 06:46:21] jugglinmike: I'm running a class, and I'd like to avoid explaining to students how to download the right binary for their system and what it means to "put it in the PATH"
[2014-01-30 06:46:30] jimevans: jugglinmike: oh.
[2014-01-30 06:46:32] jimevans: i see
[2014-01-30 06:46:36] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-30 06:46:45] jugglinmike: Much easier to say, "Install Firefox!"
[2014-01-30 06:46:56] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: yea, firefox is the easiest to get going with
[2014-01-30 06:47:11] jimevans: so. IE and chrome implement drivers as separate executables. for firefox, the driver is implemented (for the moment) as a browser extension, which the language bindings (should) know how to install and activate.
[2014-01-30 06:47:38] jugglinmike: Although, long term, I could envision a Node.js module that automates the process of downloading the laters chromedriver for the current system, referencing the custom location
[2014-01-30 06:47:39] jimevans: that changes in the near future with firefox driver 2 (aka marionette), which is build directly into firefox.
[2014-01-30 06:47:52] *jimevans <3 marionette'
[2014-01-30 06:47:56] jugglinmike: And the good work by AutomatedTester :)

[2014-01-30 06:48:24] jugglinmike: Okay, I think this explains why things aren't working for me on Firefox right now
[2014-01-30 06:48:25] jimevans: and ato?

[2014-01-30 06:48:43] jugglinmike: So I need Firefox *and* a plugin--is that right?
[2014-01-30 06:48:44] AutomatedTester: and ato, sorry forgot about him
[2014-01-30 06:48:53] AutomatedTester: didnt mean anything by that
[2014-01-30 06:49:05] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: the plugin is part of the languange binding
[2014-01-30 06:49:06] jimevans: jugglinmike: the plugin should be bundled with the language bindings.
[2014-01-30 06:49:25] jugglinmike: jimevans: hmm

[2014-01-30 06:50:12] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: python, ruby, .net and java do the necessary installation of the profile and the extension for firefox
[2014-01-30 06:50:19] jugglinmike: jimevans: How does the plugin get installed? Do the language bindings typically just copy files into the system's Firefox directory?
[2014-01-30 06:50:26] jimevans: jugglinmike: if you can wait a couple of hours, i'd expect jleyba to come online. he's a lot more familiar with the js bindings (including node) than i am.
[2014-01-30 06:50:58] jimevans: but every language binding i know of creates an anonymous profile (usually in the tmp directory) and installs the plugin into that anonymous profile.
[2014-01-30 06:50:59] jugglinmike: jimevans: I sure can. I very much appreciate the info you've been able to give me so far, though :)
[2014-01-30 06:51:17] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py is the python code for setting it
[2014-01-30 06:51:24] jimevans: optionally, that anonymous profile can be a copy of an existing user's profile.
[2014-01-30 06:51:42] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: the __init__ method  is the one of interest
[2014-01-30 06:51:56] AutomatedTester: jugglinmike: and https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py#235

[2014-01-30 07:08:13] dimacus: so i've been wondering, what is the advantage of returning a page object after performing some action on a page vs using static methods and navigating around with class names? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/52ff159e0c9e44b6d074
[2014-01-30 07:08:17] dimacus: example ^^
[2014-01-30 07:08:55] dimacus: doesn't making the "submit" method on 1 page return the new instance of the next page object coupling them together?
[2014-01-30 07:09:44] dimacus: for example, if you are testing a submit form, and 1 test you have invalid form entries, so the submit action should return an instance of current page and if it's a successful form submission it should return instance of the next page in the flow
[2014-01-30 07:10:05] dimacus: now you have to designate the "submit" button to know if you will move on or stay on the same page etc...
[2014-01-30 07:11:27] jimevans: dimacus: well, that depends.

[2014-01-30 07:12:46] jimevans: if it were me, i'd have two submit methods. one that submits successfully, the other that submits expecting an error.
[2014-01-30 07:13:31] dimacus: ok, so both would know which page to return… makes sense
[2014-01-30 07:13:48] jimevans: (actually, if it were me, i'd use .net, and have the submit be a generic method: currentPage.SubmitForm<T>() where T is the expected type of return)
[2014-01-30 07:14:39] dimacus: hmmm interesting, so you submit and tell it what page you expect to have next
[2014-01-30 07:15:19] dimacus: isn't this similar to what i was talking about though, having a generic "submit" that is as dumb as it gets, and then explicitly say what page you expect in the next line?
[2014-01-30 07:15:32] dimacus: (again, not sure if ruby tranlates to .NET that simply)
[2014-01-30 07:16:01] dimacus: i just don't see the point of making the SubmitForm() be anything else but a dumb "click here" and nothing more
[2014-01-30 07:18:56] Dave_B_: i prefer not returning a page object and leaving it to the test writer but both can work
[2014-01-30 07:19:00] jimevans: well, again, it depends on how you've structured your page object.
[2014-01-30 07:19:11] jimevans: i can see arguments either way
[2014-01-30 07:19:38] dimacus: this is purely academic inquiry, just trying to figure out advantages/disadvantages of both aproaches
[2014-01-30 07:21:31] jimevans: in actuality, what i'd probably really for realz do is have both. a method that is a "dumb submit", which can return whatever page type might be appropriate, and two "convenience" methods (one success, one failure) that return the correct type for each operation.
[2014-01-30 07:22:22] dimacus: isn't that an anti-pattern though, to have more than a single way to accomplish any task?
[2014-01-30 07:22:49] jimevans: i dunno about *that*.

[2014-01-30 07:23:41] jimevans: i'm not sure i'd call it an "anti-pattern" per se, but it'd be pretty easy to grep the code base to find out who's using the "dumb submit" method instead of the convenience methods

[2014-01-30 15:13:33] dogarrhea: it must actually be a hover.  seems like the selenium driver doesn't work when i use         Actions hoverActionToEnableDeleteLink = new Actions(driver);         hoverActionToEnableDeleteLink.moveToElement(root).perform()
[2014-01-30 15:13:38] dogarrhea: this seems like a bug.
[2014-01-30 15:14:32] jimevans: dogarrhea: what happens when you do that action?
[2014-01-30 15:14:36] jimevans: also, http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html
[2014-01-30 15:14:50] dogarrhea: i've read that lol
[2014-01-30 15:14:52] jimevans: and http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/01/revisiting-native-events-in-ie-driver.html
[2014-01-30 15:14:59] dogarrhea: and your response that "this question has been covered many times"
[2014-01-30 15:15:58] jimevans: yes, on the user-facing mailing lists, the question had come up over and over and over again, always with the same response.
[2014-01-30 15:16:49] dogarrhea: hrm
[2014-01-30 15:16:54] dogarrhea: we disabled native events for another bug
[2014-01-30 15:18:05] dogarrhea: this seems suboptimal
[2014-01-30 15:18:24] jimevans: i'll say.
[2014-01-30 15:19:00] jimevans: i'd love a good, solid, consistent way to simulate mouse input, but microsoft and windows really don't give you one.
[2014-01-30 15:19:14] dogarrhea: guess i'll just execute native javascript
[2014-01-30 15:19:15] jimevans: well, sendinput comes closest, but it requires the target window to have focus.
[2014-01-30 15:19:28] jimevans: hint: native events off uses javascript.
[2014-01-30 15:20:07] dogarrhea: guess i'll just do everything in c++ gtk, and c++ windows api
[2014-01-30 15:20:12] dogarrhea: i was going to try desiredCapabilities.setCapability('EnablePersistentHover', true)
[2014-01-30 15:20:19] jimevans: it's on by default.
[2014-01-30 15:20:35] jimevans: read the second blog post from above. it tells you exactly what that does.
[2014-01-30 15:20:40] jimevans: and why it's suboptimal too.
[2014-01-30 15:20:56] dogarrhea: link?
[2014-01-30 15:21:01] jimevans: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/01/revisiting-native-events-in-ie-driver.html
[2014-01-30 15:21:48] jimevans: be my guest to implement using c++, but i don't think you'll be breaking any ground the existing IE driver doesn't already do.
[2014-01-30 15:22:03] AutomatedTester: yay for sublime text 2 deciding to stop working
[2014-01-30 15:22:27] dogarrhea: so, is there any in language support?
[2014-01-30 15:22:35] jimevans: for what?
[2014-01-30 15:22:37] dogarrhea: or is this just not possible without dropping to native javascript executor
[2014-01-30 15:22:40] dogarrhea: hover.
[2014-01-30 15:23:06] jimevans: the actions class with moveToElement is the right thing using the webdriver api
[2014-01-30 15:23:14] jimevans: you have three choices for IE
[2014-01-30 15:23:36] jimevans: nativeEvents = true (default). uses the (flawed) approach of sendmessage api
[2014-01-30 15:24:07] jimevans: nativeEvents = true, with requireWindowFocus = true. uses sendinput api. more "correct" but requires the browser window to be in focus.
[2014-01-30 15:24:39] jimevans: nativeEvents = false. uses the webdriver project's javascript implementation to simulate mouse events.
[2014-01-30 15:25:07] dogarrhea: hrm. nativeEvents is false for something we fixed a month ago or so
[2014-01-30 15:25:23] dogarrhea: nativeEvents = false and moveToElement is the way then?
[2014-01-30 15:25:27] jimevans: yep.
[2014-01-30 15:25:31] jimevans: well, probably.

[2014-01-30 15:25:56] jimevans: there's still a chance that the javascript is not *exactly* correct in what mouse events it fires and in what order.

[2014-01-30 15:37:46] LocusAsaf: anyway
[2014-01-30 15:37:51] jimevans: then why click the button at all? just call the javascript function that the button click would activate.
[2014-01-30 15:38:15] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-30 15:38:31] jimevans: let me clarify that.
[2014-01-30 15:38:34] LocusAsaf: jimevans: let's ignore the hidden button for a second and let's say I want to click on the normal visible button
[2014-01-30 15:38:40] jimevans: okay.
[2014-01-30 15:38:42] jimevans: no problem.
[2014-01-30 15:38:45] LocusAsaf: jimevans: that's not working for me either
[2014-01-30 15:38:59] jimevans: what's not working about it?
[2014-01-30 15:39:06] LocusAsaf: jimevans: driver.execute_script('$(document).ready(function(){$("button.btn-primary").click()});')
[2014-01-30 15:39:30] LocusAsaf: the button is not being clicked
[2014-01-30 15:40:14] jimevans: so driver.find_element_by_css_selector("button.btn-primary").click(), does that work?
[2014-01-30 15:40:35] jimevans: i'm assuming you're using python or something here as your language binding.
[2014-01-30 15:40:40] LocusAsaf: wheras driver.find_elements_by_css_selector('button.btn-primary').click() works
[2014-01-30 15:40:47] LocusAsaf: jimevans: yup python
[2014-01-30 15:41:09] jimevans: okay so the normal method for clicking on a button works. why not use that?
[2014-01-30 15:41:17] jimevans: i'm confused.

[2014-01-30 15:41:58] LocusAsaf: jimevans: well I guess I'm trying to figure out why my execute script doesn't work at all
[2014-01-30 15:42:05] jimevans: if your goal is to click a button, and the .click() method on the button element works, i'm not understanding the issue.

[2014-01-30 15:42:18] jimevans: if your goal is to execute some script, that's different.
[2014-01-30 15:42:37] LocusAsaf: jimevans: as I said my ultimate goal is to click a hidden button
[2014-01-30 15:42:44] sach, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-30 15:42:46] LocusAsaf: jimevans: the .click won't work on a hidden one
[2014-01-30 15:42:59] jimevans: and again, i say the jquery ready() function has probably already executed by the time you try to call it as part of execute_script.
[2014-01-30 15:43:05] jimevans: what happens if you do something like this?

[2014-01-30 15:43:47] jimevans: driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", driver.find_element_by_css_selector("button.locator"));
[2014-01-30 15:43:57] sach: hey folks, anybody know how to automate switching user agent via ide?
[2014-01-30 15:43:58] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-30 15:44:09] jimevans: take jquery out of the equation entirely.
[2014-01-30 15:45:02] jimevans: or, just do this: driver.execute_script("$('button.locator').click();")
[2014-01-30 15:46:01] jimevans: quit trying to diddle around with $(document).ready. it's complicating matters, i think.

[2014-01-30 15:47:50] *jimevans hates jquery with the passion of a thousand suns'

[2014-01-30 15:48:18] LocusAsaf: jimevans: yeah the second example also fails
[2014-01-30 15:48:25] LocusAsaf: button is not being clicked
[2014-01-30 15:48:56] jimevans: we're at the point where i need to see an example to help you further.
[2014-01-30 15:49:10] jimevans: maybe someone else can have better luck.
[2014-01-30 15:49:29] LocusAsaf: I'll try and come up with a generic example
[2014-01-30 15:49:37] jimevans: oh, one other thing, have you tried these code samples in a browser that draws? chrome or firefox?
[2014-01-30 15:49:53] LocusAsaf: yeah if i switch the webdriver to firefox everything works
[2014-01-30 15:50:21] jimevans: well, it's entirely possible that phantomjs is just broken then.
[2014-01-30 15:50:45] jimevans: what happens if you try the same thing in phantomjs *without* using webdriver?
[2014-01-30 15:51:36] jimevans: i mean, phantomjs is great and all, but it's not representative of *any* shipping real browser.
[2014-01-30 15:51:55] jimevans: (chrome no longer uses webkit; safari doesn't use javascriptcore)
[2014-01-30 15:52:14] rita1, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-01-30 15:52:38] jimevans: but you'd be closer to the phantomjs rendering pipeline by trying it with chrome.
