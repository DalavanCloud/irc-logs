[2014-01-01 00:59:08] WillPittenger: Is there a way to have a driver open a new tab?  I need to retrieve some XML from a servlet, but the servlet appears to be expecting session cookies.  I need to keep the current page open.
[2014-01-01 01:14:26] ato: WillPittenger: driver.executeScript("window.open()"); perhaps?

[2014-01-01 01:16:12] ato: You'd need to switch the WebDriver context to that window.
[2014-01-01 01:16:46] ato: It should appear in driver.getWindowHandles().
[2014-01-01 01:17:21] ato: So you could do driver.switchTo().window(w).
