[2014-01-14 00:18:05] koshie: Is there a way to tell to the browser to open on one of my screen and not on the other one?

[2014-01-14 00:18:36] koshie: And this is really annoying.

[2014-01-14 01:30:27] l3dx: I tried using a wait with ExpectedConditions.presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy(locator)
[2014-01-14 01:31:02] koshie: l3dx: I'm not using the same language as you, but I use the keyword Wait Until Page Contains  somethingINeedToCheck
[2014-01-14 01:31:03] l3dx: but in some cases the container is empty, which is fine, and then an exception is thrown. which is not fine :p
[2014-01-14 01:31:16] koshie: And so you can look for a HTML tag or what ever, isn't?
[2014-01-14 01:31:31] l3dx: yes
[2014-01-14 01:31:52] koshie: I'm using sleep ONLY for some cases, now, and I prefer Wait Until Page Contains
[2014-01-14 01:32:09] koshie: for example with ImapLibrary it's useful to do a Sleep  10 before opening a mailbox
[2014-01-14 01:32:22] koshie: Because if the mailbox is already opened and the mail is coming, ImapLibrary don't see it.
[2014-01-14 01:32:29] l3dx: I see
[2014-01-14 01:32:32] koshie: (which is weird)
[2014-01-14 01:32:53] l3dx: in my case I have a div which _may_ have sub elements.
[2014-01-14 01:33:03] koshie: It's like it's opening the mailbox and the "status" of the mailbox are "frozen"
[2014-01-14 01:33:16] l3dx: I don't know how to wait for them to become visible when they are present, and move on without an error when they are not
[2014-01-14 01:33:22] koshie: so try witht the keywords above, it'll probably works.

[2014-01-14 03:16:47] barancev: or keep it dual-protocol?
[2014-01-14 03:16:58] simonstewart: We'll pull out the RC support into a legacy support package
[2014-01-14 03:17:06] simonstewart: and then only update it in an emergency
[2014-01-14 03:17:19] simonstewart: Effectively, we're going to a single protocol
[2014-01-14 03:17:21] barancev: so we ship two versions of the server?
[2014-01-14 03:17:26] simonstewart: Yes
[2014-01-14 03:17:30] barancev: ok
[2014-01-14 03:17:37] simonstewart: One lightweight one based on netty/webbit
[2014-01-14 03:17:47] simonstewart: And the Old One with Jetty 4 or 5 in it
[2014-01-14 03:18:01] simonstewart: The latter being in the legacy package
[2014-01-14 03:18:48] barancev: actually, it is hard to pull RC to a separate package out of the server
[2014-01-14 03:19:12] barancev: I'd say we have to leave the current dual-protocol server as legacy
[2014-01-14 03:19:21] barancev: and create a stripped one as 3.0
[2014-01-14 03:19:24] simonstewart: See my comment above
[2014-01-14 03:19:49] barancev: >> We'll pull out the RC support into a legacy support package << -- it is not about the server, right?
[2014-01-14 03:20:05] simonstewart: Including the old server

[2014-01-14 03:22:47] simonstewart: Yeah. That was quite a long time ago

[2014-01-14 03:34:42] simonstewart: uh
[2014-01-14 03:34:52] simonstewart: we'd still have a ruby module in the project
[2014-01-14 03:34:57] simonstewart: because of the ruby language bindings
[2014-01-14 03:35:34] barancev: yes, but it can be pure ruby, like the python module
[2014-01-14 03:35:48] simonstewart: It is
[2014-01-14 03:36:02] simonstewart: IJ Ultimate supports editing ruby code too
[2014-01-14 03:36:12] barancev: yes

[2014-01-14 03:36:22] simonstewart: and that requires a ruby sdk

[2014-01-14 07:56:31] nirvdrum: Yeah.  Most web app frameworks implement CSRF protection by storing a value in the session.
[2014-01-14 07:56:40] nirvdrum: Usually you need a cookie to load the session.
[2014-01-14 07:56:55] Kal: either selenium by default should be disabling all the cookies

[2014-01-14 08:16:15] AutomatedTester: which browser/browser version/os ?
[2014-01-14 08:16:33] Kal: it seems selenium is saving some browser data, which is obstructing when it launches second time

[2014-01-14 09:03:10] Ankhular: you must press the play or run button
[2014-01-14 09:03:11] Ankhular: i believe
[2014-01-14 09:03:16] Ankhular: then it will appear on the right side

[2014-01-14 09:11:41] Ankhular: i've been testing on a native app
[2014-01-14 09:11:49] Ankhular: want me to toss up a github?
[2014-01-14 09:12:00] jimevans: wait. i'm confused.
[2014-01-14 09:12:27] Ankhular: I am trying to click a similar data table
[2014-01-14 09:12:30] jimevans: you're using webdriver? or a native app client like appium, ios-driver or selendroid?
[2014-01-14 09:12:37] Ankhular: im using webdriver
[2014-01-14 09:12:44] Ankhular: but on a datatable from an app thats hosted locally
[2014-01-14 09:12:48] Ankhular: rather than on the jsfiddle
[2014-01-14 09:12:58] jimevans: okay that's more clear now.
[2014-01-14 09:13:13] Ankhular: I think its good enough to find it regardles of the jsfiddle pane

[2014-01-14 09:15:14] jimevans: that goes for finding any element. all element finds are scoped to the frame that has webdriver's
[2014-01-14 09:15:16] Ankhular: so you can play on your own system
[2014-01-14 09:15:18] jimevans: "focus"
[2014-01-14 09:15:19] Ankhular: without frames
[2014-01-14 09:15:21] Ankhular: right
[2014-01-14 09:15:37] Ankhular: in the app being tested.. all the elements are in the "focus" frame

[2014-01-14 09:48:43] jeffszusz: how can i close the context menu after a contextClick() without selecting an option?
[2014-01-14 09:49:12] jimevans: jeffszusz: i'd probably try sendkeys(Keys.Escape)
[2014-01-14 09:49:21] jimevans: but i don't know if that would work
[2014-01-14 09:49:33] jeffszusz: trying that but something is failing...
[2014-01-14 09:49:40] jeffszusz: not sure which, hard to read this traceback
[2014-01-14 09:49:41] ato: Click somewhere else on the page.
[2014-01-14 09:50:01] ato: And hope that triggers the right code path.
[2014-01-14 09:50:02] jeffszusz: tried that too, i can click and interact with anything i want and the context menu stays open
[2014-01-14 09:50:11] jeffszusz: :(
[2014-01-14 09:50:18] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-14 09:50:22] ato: So officially this isn't covered by Selenium.
[2014-01-14 09:50:31] jeffszusz: so it's a chromedriver issue
[2014-01-14 09:50:37] ato: There's no way for it to interact with the chrome of the web browser.
[2014-01-14 09:50:49] DanielSi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-14 09:50:49] ato: I'd probably say it's working as expected.
[2014-01-14 09:51:04] jeffszusz: hm
[2014-01-14 09:51:42] KrzFra: @barancev I am using assertConfirmation and I use the plugin for Firefox
[2014-01-14 09:52:04] ato: jeffszusz: A right click in a web app might defer the browser context menu in favour of one implemented in HTML/CSS.
[2014-01-14 09:52:21] ato: That's the use case for the context click Selenium provides.
[2014-01-14 09:52:25] DanielSi, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-01-14 09:52:55] jeffszusz: darn
[2014-01-14 09:52:57] jeffszusz: ok
[2014-01-14 09:53:24] Bebe_sel, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-14 09:53:34] ato: This all depends on how the browser is implemented.
[2014-01-14 09:54:02] ato: In Opera, typing Keys.ESCAPE will close the context menu because the chrome of the browser is implemented using DOM event listeners.

[2014-01-14 09:54:21] jleyba, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-14 09:54:27] ato: In Firefox (using Marionette) you could transcend into the chrome context to interact with the XUL, making it possible to click context menu items.
[2014-01-14 09:54:34] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-14 09:55:01] ato: My point is only that this is terra incognita, or uncharted territory.
[2014-01-14 09:55:08] jeffszusz: right
[2014-01-14 09:55:18] jeffszusz: so if there's a way to do it, i'd have to ask the chromedriver folks, since that's what we're using
[2014-01-14 09:55:28] ato: Yeah, pretty much.
[2014-01-14 09:56:11] barancev: KrzFra: use * instead of the exact confirmation text
[2014-01-14 09:56:27] jeffszusz: is there another way to do a "right click" when all I'm trying to test is that buttons other than left click don't do something?
[2014-01-14 09:57:40] ato: You could add a JS event listener for the mouse that defers (preventDefault and return false) the event.
[2014-01-14 09:58:14] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-14 09:58:50] ato: If you couple that with introspection of an event queue you could theoretically check that nothing happened.
[2014-01-14 09:59:02] ato: But it seems rather complex.
[2014-01-14 09:59:37] jeffszusz: yeah seems more complex than i want

[2014-01-14 12:13:06] AutomatedTester: its not very cross platform :)
[2014-01-14 12:13:50] jeffszusz: lol
[2014-01-14 12:14:31] jeffszusz: we have a tool that you can rotate by clicking and dragging the end
[2014-01-14 12:14:56] AutomatedTester: ok, but thats not middle click
[2014-01-14 12:16:55] jeffszusz: but if you right-click it, it will start the drag rotate - but the context menu interrupts it and cancels the 'stop' action
[2014-01-14 12:17:02] jeffszusz: so it gets stuck permanently to your cursor until you click again
[2014-01-14 12:17:10] jeffszusz: i've fixed that by detecting that e.which is 1
[2014-01-14 12:17:31] AutomatedTester: ok, how do you middle click on OSX?
[2014-01-14 12:17:34] jeffszusz: but now i tried to write a test that will fail if anything other than a left click doesn't work
[2014-01-14 12:17:52] jeffszusz: option-click i guess
[2014-01-14 12:17:59] jeffszusz: or was it command
[2014-01-14 12:18:01] jeffszusz: don't recall
[2014-01-14 12:21:03] AutomatedTester: I am not sure but we try avoid adding things to webdriver when its not going to be cross platform

[2014-01-14 12:35:04] AutomatedTester: jeffszusz: are you loading the browsers context menu or one you have created?
[2014-01-14 12:35:17] jeffszusz: just the browser's
[2014-01-14 12:35:33] jeffszusz: i don't actually care about the context menu except that it won't GTFO after it comes up
[2014-01-14 12:36:00] jeffszusz: Keys.ESCAPE nor clicking elsewhere will get rid of it
[2014-01-14 12:36:30] jeffszusz: which it has been explained to me is because the context menu is browser chrome which is untouchable
[2014-01-14 12:37:24] AutomatedTester: escape isnt working?
[2014-01-14 12:37:27] AutomatedTester: interesting
[2014-01-14 12:37:30] jeffszusz: nope
[2014-01-14 12:37:59] jeffszusz: is it supposed to?
[2014-01-14 12:38:27] AutomatedTester: it *should* do what the browser does
[2014-01-14 12:38:42] AutomatedTester: and the browser clears it if you do it manually

[2014-01-14 12:39:06] jeffszusz: hm so maybe something else is happening to me
[2014-01-14 12:40:00] ato: To be fair there are far more platforms that do have a concept of three button mice than those who don't.
[2014-01-14 12:40:22] jeffszusz: and macs do use the three buttons if you plug a regular mouse in
[2014-01-14 12:40:23] ato: And Mac OS does actually register them if you use a different hardware device.
[2014-01-14 12:41:38] ato: But a more sensible approach might be to have an even more low-level interface for buttons.
[2014-01-14 12:42:26] AutomatedTester: ato: for all potential mouse buttons
[2014-01-14 12:42:28] AutomatedTester: ?
[2014-01-14 12:42:30] ato: On Linux the left clicking triggers a ButtonPress event on “button 1”.  Middle click triggers 2, and right click button 3.
[2014-01-14 12:42:56] ato: My current mouse has two additional buttons on the side (which I don't use) that are identified as buttons 8 and 9.
[2014-01-14 12:43:27] AutomatedTester: gaming mice have a plethora of mouse buttons for different things
[2014-01-14 12:43:29] ato: At least this is what xev is telling me.
[2014-01-14 12:43:56] ato: I don't know a lot about this.  I wonder how X deals with alternative device input, like a gamepad.
[2014-01-14 12:44:09] jeffszusz: 1, 2 and 3 should be cross platform for left, middle, right
[2014-01-14 12:44:20] AutomatedTester: ato: we arent supporting gamepad
[2014-01-14 12:44:21] AutomatedTester: yet
[2014-01-14 12:44:31] ato: Well it doesn't really matter if they are cross platform or not.

[2014-01-14 13:06:46] rjen: is there no way to force selenium webdriver to use a specific firefox profile? does it always create an anonymous temp profile for firefox?
[2014-01-14 13:07:10] melter, quitting. (Quit: Client exiting)
[2014-01-14 13:07:16] jimevans: rjen: yes, it always does, but you can use an existing profile as a template.
[2014-01-14 13:07:30] rjen: ah i see jimevans

[2014-01-14 13:08:20] rjen: so the problem is if i were to use webdriver to automate a firefox plugin extension installation it will be installed into an anonymous profile
[2014-01-14 13:08:23] jimevans: there is a good and sufficient reason for this. consider the case of multiple firefox driver instances running on the same machine. without copying into an anonymous profile, there would be resource contentions between the driver instances for the profile.
[2014-01-14 13:09:02] jimevans: yes, that's true (though i confess, i don't see how this is a problem, per se)

[2014-01-14 13:10:23] rjen: ok that is not big problem jimevans
[2014-01-14 13:10:31] rjen: the problem is that anonymous profile keeps generating a new name
[2014-01-14 13:10:43] rjen: i am trying to test the plugin that I automatically install
[2014-01-14 13:11:01] rjen: so test 1 webdriver installs developed plugin
[2014-01-14 13:11:10] rjen: test 2 webdriver tests the plugin against a web app
[2014-01-14 13:11:21] rjen: test 1 and test 2 will both have its own anonymous profile
[2014-01-14 13:11:30] rjen: i need test 2 to use test 1s installed plugin
[2014-01-14 13:12:13] rjen: can i have selenium generate the exact same name each time?
[2014-01-14 13:12:30] rjen: and i'll just delete the temp directory after the tests lol
[2014-01-14 13:12:35] jimevans: so why not have test2 use a profile with the plugin installed? or use the FirefoxProfile object to launch firefox with a profile that includes the installed plugin?
[2014-01-14 13:13:55] rjen: i can jimevans but it will say anonymousxxxx whatever profile on the machine
[2014-01-14 13:14:06] rjen: instead of "MyProfile"
[2014-01-14 13:14:11] jimevans: so what/
[2014-01-14 13:14:13] jimevans: ?
[2014-01-14 13:14:36] rjen: so you're saying just use the selenium webdriver generated anonymous profiles then?
[2014-01-14 13:14:46] jimevans: yes. exactly.
[2014-01-14 13:14:52] rjen: ok i guess i can do that
[2014-01-14 13:14:56] rjen: adding more lines of code :(
[2014-01-14 13:15:03] jimevans: i don't see why you should care what the name of the profile is.
[2014-01-14 13:15:12] rjen: i don't that much
[2014-01-14 13:15:25] rjen: the problem is in a continuous development environment
[2014-01-14 13:15:37] rjen: anonymous123
[2014-01-14 13:15:55] jimevans: still not seeing a problem.
[2014-01-14 13:16:26] merike, changing nick to merike|away.
[2014-01-14 13:16:33] rjen: so anonymous_123 profile with release_1 then I generate tests that use that profile but then new release_2 makes anonymous_1234 and etc...
[2014-01-14 13:16:49] rjen: i will need my tests to call the right anonymous profile each time
[2014-01-14 13:16:51] rjen: it's not a set name
[2014-01-14 13:16:59] rjen: that just seems kinda tedious
[2014-01-14 13:17:02] jimevans: give me a second.

[2014-01-14 13:20:07] jimevans: has no dependency on the profile name.
[2014-01-14 13:20:15] jimevans: has no dependency on what version of the extension you're using.
[2014-01-14 13:20:59] jimevans: (note that's code written off the top of my head, so it might not be entirely correct)
[2014-01-14 13:21:08] rjen: ah that could work, but then i'm not testing my web application properly. the web app serves the .xpi file through firefox which i have the automation click on the install now and etc... in firefox
[2014-01-14 13:22:42] jimevans: sounds like separate tests to me. an installation test and a functionality test.
[2014-01-14 13:23:02] jimevans: but now i need to get back to "real" work. :)
[2014-01-14 13:23:14] rjen: aight thanks jimevans
[2014-01-14 13:23:34] rjen: i will see if i can just use the anonymous profile in some way

[2014-01-14 14:16:32] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Yeah.  I was surprised how much traction that comment got.

[2014-01-14 14:17:07] nirvdrum: The circle of Nest fanboys probably sits entirely in the circle of Apple fanboys, so I shouldn't be surprised.
[2014-01-14 14:17:59] nirvdrum: The only scenario that makes sense to me is Google wants to get in the living room before MS takes it with the XBox One.  Or something like that.
[2014-01-14 14:18:05] nirvdrum: Since Google TV has been a flop.

[2014-01-14 14:18:42] nirvdrum: I just didn't buy the notion than Nest was going to double its revenue every year for the next five years while keeping costs flat in order to get at the $3.2 B.
[2014-01-14 14:19:53] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: But, yeah, I had several people say something to the effect of it letting Google get in every home.  Which suggests people don't understand the construction industry at all.  Homebuyers aren't going to spec a $250 - $300 thermostat and won't put up with one thrust upon them.  And most won't after-market purchase it either.
[2014-01-14 14:20:25] nirvdrum: It's the problem that's plagued every company that's tried to improve basic fixtures in a home.
