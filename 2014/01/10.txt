[2014-01-10 01:29:35] Androidnewbe: Hi I am doing some selenium testing and I wonder what is the best approach. Let’s say I have a web site on which you can crate project (A) for each project you can create tasks (B)   and for each task you can create user (C) now A,B,C are all separate pages and they all depended on each other so can’t have C without B without A. Now I was thinking about having separate test class for each page that would mean that I coul
[2014-01-10 01:29:36] Tuplario, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 01:29:52] Androidnewbe: but then to test C I  would have to create Proejct (A) and task (B). Other option is to have something like FullWebsiteTest where I create project in one test function then I crate task in another and user in another but that would mean that all those test functions would depend on each other which is not how test should work? So what is the best approach in this case?

[2014-01-10 10:20:58] dogarrhea: threaded junit test?
[2014-01-10 10:21:01] lukeis: if you're using one instance of an application / database to run all your tests against and a test case modifies the data store that could affect any other tests on that environment, you need to start running your suite against more environments.  (we dynamically provision new environments for each test class)
[2014-01-10 10:21:27] *lukeis not recommending manual testing'

[2014-01-10 10:22:35] dogarrhea: the use case to test is 1 environment and multiple users

[2014-01-10 10:23:28] lukeis: think about your use case, are you expecting random actions happening all at once? that is non-deterministic of a test
[2014-01-10 10:23:55] dogarrhea: data shouldn't be isolated. people are logging in at the same time and changing a note or recommending an action be taken or not
[2014-01-10 10:24:18] lukeis: remove 'or' from that sentence and create your test case
[2014-01-10 10:24:45] lukeis: there is no reason a single test can't have multiple webdriver instances
[2014-01-10 10:25:05] dogarrhea: yea i'm thinking about the threading with multiple drivers but it will break jenkins integration entirely
[2014-01-10 10:25:20] dogarrhea: this is kind of how they decided to do test running. at jenkins level
[2014-01-10 10:25:40] dogarrhea: 1 browser = 1 jenkins job.
[2014-01-10 10:25:53] lukeis: i thought you were using saucelabs?
[2014-01-10 10:26:10] dogarrhea: jenkins and saucelabs
[2014-01-10 10:26:23] dogarrhea: saucelabs provides the browser/os combinations among other features
[2014-01-10 10:27:05] llaskin: luke: you must be bored today eh?
[2014-01-10 10:27:05] lukeis: sounds like you need to spend some more time thinking about how your setup is working and how to enable a single test to have multiple webdriver instances

[2014-01-10 12:51:06] AutomatedTester: jimevans: hows codemash?
[2014-01-10 12:51:08] jimevans: the failures were introduced when barancev|2 added new tests

[2014-01-10 12:53:02] jimevans: i think it was
[2014-01-10 12:53:07] jimevans: (a blip)
[2014-01-10 12:53:51] jimevans: barancev|2: the real problem is that the failure depends highly on the document mode the browser recognizes for the document.
[2014-01-10 12:54:32] barancev|2: yea, document modes are evil
[2014-01-10 12:54:57] jimevans: if we're in standards mode, we have a much better success rate. quirks mode kills us.
[2014-01-10 12:55:26] barancev|2: microsoft afraids to be "not backward compatible" and add even more complexity, for web designers too

[2014-01-10 12:57:35] barancev|2: they can stay with old versions of the browser
[2014-01-10 12:57:55] AutomatedTester: MS are getting better about not being backwards compatible
[2014-01-10 12:57:57] barancev|2: if ms allowed to install several different IE vesions

[2014-01-10 15:44:56] barancev|2: :)
[2014-01-10 15:45:02] AutomatedTester: but that doesnt make it right
[2014-01-10 15:45:10] jleyba: It doesn't loop over the frames, just checks the network activity of the top-level chrome window (or whatever it is called in XUL land)
[2014-01-10 15:45:16] jleyba: LOL
[2014-01-10 15:45:36] jleyba: do you know how much of the json wire protocol is the way it is b/c that's how it was implemented in the FirefoxDriver?
[2014-01-10 15:46:12] AutomatedTester: well I for one don't do things because thats how it was...
[2014-01-10 15:46:14] jleyba: We should be willing to slash and burn as we develop a true standard for everyone else :)
[2014-01-10 15:46:38] AutomatedTester: and I have with advanced user interactions
[2014-01-10 15:46:57] AutomatedTester: 1 end point for the sequence so its done in an atomic action
[2014-01-10 15:47:01] AutomatedTester: like real life
[2014-01-10 15:47:32] jleyba: I argued for that when those were first developed :(
[2014-01-10 15:47:35] barancev|2: AutomatedTester: and modifier state persistence?
[2014-01-10 15:48:25] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: do people do a sequence and then hold buttons continuously afterwards?
[2014-01-10 15:48:30] Brando753, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-01-10 15:48:48] jleyba: AutomatedTester: you want modifiers to always be released after an action sequence?
[2014-01-10 15:48:54] jleyba: like WebElement#sendKeys()?
[2014-01-10 15:48:57] barancev|2: what about a timeout between actions in a sequence?
[2014-01-10 15:49:32] jleyba: ^ not just a timeout, but any pause in the sequence for some local action
[2014-01-10 15:49:32] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yes but at the end of the sequence in case it influences the last command in the sequence
[2014-01-10 15:49:42] Brando753, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 15:49:59] jleyba: So at the end of perform() they would be released?
[2014-01-10 15:49:59] AutomatedTester: we have wait() to pause things in the sequence
[2014-01-10 15:50:04] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 15:50:04] AutomatedTester: yes
[2014-01-10 15:50:08] detronizator_: GhostDriver !== browser? Oh right, it's a bidet!
[2014-01-10 15:50:10] jleyba: please no wait
[2014-01-10 15:50:14] timbo1, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 15:50:15] barancev|2: +1
[2014-01-10 15:50:38] AutomatedTester: why not wait()
[2014-01-10 15:51:01] tourdedave, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 15:51:06] jleyba: Ok, I can get on board with perform() releasing commands - we can extend the client api to support custom actions (giving users chance to perform assertions, etc. while a modifier is down)
[2014-01-10 15:51:07] barancev|2: because you need "wait for element to appear" not a constant timeout
[2014-01-10 15:51:21] barancev|2: think about slow loading menus
[2014-01-10 15:52:01] barancev|2: or drag-n-drop with the target to appear after you started to drag
[2014-01-10 15:52:49] AutomatedTester: the 2nd case doesnt make any difference
[2014-01-10 15:52:50] mansi, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-10 15:52:57] barancev|2: drag-n-drop with modifier key and delayed target -- that's why you need to break sequences and keep modifiers state persistent between parts
[2014-01-10 15:53:08] AutomatedTester: advanced user interactions doesnt care about visibility of elements
[2014-01-10 15:54:21] AutomatedTester: so you want to be able to do 2 sequences in a row and sequence 2 relies on sequence 1?
[2014-01-10 15:54:34] barancev|2: drag-n-drop to expanding tree -- drag to the tree node, wait for the node to expand, drag to a subnode and release. all with control key
[2014-01-10 15:54:54] jleyba: the client api could have new Actions(driver).mouseDown().wait(untilVisibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("Foo")).mouseUp().perform();
[2014-01-10 15:55:31] barancev|2: passing conditions in actions sequence and implementing on the browser side seems too hard to implement
[2014-01-10 15:55:33] jleyba: that "wait" would just be an internal pause in the sequence for some client-side action.. but we shouldn't support "wait for x amount of time" at the protocol level
[2014-01-10 15:55:54] jleyba: The wait wouldn't be passed to the server
[2014-01-10 15:56:11] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we need wait() for multi finger gestures on mobile
[2014-01-10 15:56:12] barancev|2: then we break the sequence into two parts
[2014-01-10 15:56:22] llaskin, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-10 15:56:34] AutomatedTester: its the simplest way for fingers to sync up
[2014-01-10 15:56:51] jleyba: AutomatedTester: sample usage?
[2014-01-10 15:56:54] AutomatedTester: since they are actual waits or essentially no-ops
[2014-01-10 15:58:33] AutomatedTester: garage band on mobile. You want finger A and finger B to tap at different times, you would use wait() to pause the finger A to allow Finger B to tap
[2014-01-10 15:59:37] jleyba: why not just build that into the tap command?
[2014-01-10 16:00:07] AutomatedTester: what if one finger is dragging and 1 is tapping and you want to compelete the actions at the same time
[2014-01-10 16:00:31] AutomatedTester: or finger A is a press and finger B is a move()
[2014-01-10 16:01:31] AutomatedTester: actually if Finger A is a press and finger B is move().move().move() and then want to release them at the same time
[2014-01-10 16:04:45] Dude-X, quitting. (Quit: Dude-X)
[2014-01-10 16:06:22] jleyba: releaseAll()?
[2014-01-10 16:06:37] jleyba: join().releaseAll()
[2014-01-10 16:07:17] AutomatedTester: ok, that solves the release them at the same time
[2014-01-10 16:07:41] AutomatedTester: and taps need to have hold times too?
[2014-01-10 16:09:27] jleyba: tap() for immediate down up
[2014-01-10 16:09:36] jleyba: tap(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS) for tap and hold (java)
[2014-01-10 16:09:56] AutomatedTester: and how do you sync multiple sequences that are not the same length
[2014-01-10 16:10:58] jleyba: You mean new Actions().something().perform(); new Actions().somethingElse().perform()?
[2014-01-10 16:12:04] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-10 16:12:43] AutomatedTester: I mean foo = new Actions().something().someting().somethings().myLastCall(); foo2 = new Actions().something().runWithMyLastCallOnfoo()
[2014-01-10 16:13:11] AutomatedTester: how does runMyLastCallOnfoo() make sure its run with myLastCall() ?
[2014-01-10 16:14:06] jleyba: hmmm..
[2014-01-10 16:14:22] jleyba: token = new Actions().a().b().yield().c();
[2014-01-10 16:14:39] jleyba: new Actions().x().y().join(token).perform();
[2014-01-10 16:15:11] jleyba: first sequence would halt on yield() and wait until it was told to continue
[2014-01-10 16:15:21] AutomatedTester: and yield is different to wait how?
[2014-01-10 16:15:37] jleyba: It's explicit
[2014-01-10 16:15:47] AutomatedTester: since, as I said earlier a wait can be a no-op
[2014-01-10 16:16:09] AutomatedTester: just sees it and does nothing and goes back to the other sequence
[2014-01-10 16:16:09] jleyba: How are you using wait() now?
[2014-01-10 16:16:44] AutomatedTester: foo = new Actions().something().someting().somethings().myLastCall(); foo2 = new Actions().something().wait().wait().runWithMyLastCallOnfoo()
[2014-01-10 16:17:13] jleyba: wait().wait() just inserts two artificial no-ops into foo2?
[2014-01-10 16:17:20] AutomatedTester: that will make the sequences the same length and wait doesnt wait, it just goes back to foos sequence
[2014-01-10 16:17:27] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-01-10 16:17:42] jleyba: Also, how are you actually executing these simultaneously anyhow?
[2014-01-10 16:17:52] jleyba: what tells foo1 that it should stop doing stuff and switch to foo2?
[2014-01-10 16:18:51] AutomatedTester: so we have a new Actions object called MultiAction (imaginative I know) and we do new MultiAction().add(foo).add(foo2).perform()
[2014-01-10 16:19:47] jleyba: And MultiAction just alternates between the two?
[2014-01-10 16:20:08] jleyba: foo1_step1, foo2_step1, foo1_step2, foo2_step2, ...
[2014-01-10 16:20:18] AutomatedTester: yea
