[2014-01-16 10:07:10] jimevans: jleyba: implementation question. the injected interactions atoms return the mouse/keyboard status, which i will have to manage and pass into subsequent calls to the atoms, right?

[2014-01-16 10:09:08] jleyba: jimevans: one thing to watch out for with the mouse stuff - events don't propagate as they would with a native click
[2014-01-16 10:09:30] jleyba: if you click on document.body at (X,Y), the element actually at (X,Y) won't get the click

[2014-01-16 10:12:24] rene_: Hi, is it possible to fake the geolocation of a firefox webdriver?
[2014-01-16 10:12:30] jleyba: Nothing quite like spending your morning with SQL so you can make a point
[2014-01-16 10:13:02] davidlai: what library are you using to get the geolocation?

[2014-01-16 10:14:03] davidlai: I think it should be possible to use jsmokito to shim in a mock of the library used for the geolocation to fool your webapp.

[2014-01-16 10:16:05] davidlai: You'll want to ask your devs to make that call to navigator.geolocation to some sort of wrapper function.  Then in your automated test, you can shim in a mock in it's place.

[2014-01-16 12:57:12] jimevans: nplatt: when using webdriver?
[2014-01-16 12:57:23] nplatt: jimevans: yes
[2014-01-16 12:57:34] jleyba: jimevans: what do you mean?
[2014-01-16 12:57:45] jimevans: it makes a "best faith" effort to wait for the resulting page to load.
[2014-01-16 12:57:50] jimevans: nplatt: ^^
[2014-01-16 12:57:51] nplatt: It seems to happen nearly instantly. I would expect it to be after page load.
[2014-01-16 12:59:02] jleyba: nplatt: if it's an ajax post that doesn't trigger a new page load, webdriver typically won't wait
[2014-01-16 12:59:02] jleyba: really depends on the browser
[2014-01-16 12:59:03] jleyba: jimevans: what is the compiler error you are getting?
[2014-01-16 13:00:03] jimevans: jleyba: it's not a compiler error i'm receiving. i'm getting a runtime error looking for a property 'x' on an object that doesn't exist.
[2014-01-16 13:00:38] jimevans: but i just realized i may have something else going on.
[2014-01-16 13:01:01] nplatt: jleyba: Not ajax in my test case
[2014-01-16 13:01:19] nplatt: I've set timeout to be 5s, browserTimeout to 2m
[2014-01-16 13:01:55] jimevans: nplatt: i'm not sure what that means (
[2014-01-16 13:01:57] nplatt: Then I POST the URL of a page that I've set up to sleep for 3m
[2014-01-16 13:02:24] nplatt: Maybe they're grid only settings...
[2014-01-16 13:02:25] richdownie, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-16 13:02:29] jimevans: "timeout" and "browserTimeout" aren't things in the webdriver API i'm used to.
[2014-01-16 13:03:05] jleyba: jimevans:  my guess is something with the clientXY field in the mouse state object that should be {x: number, y: number}
[2014-01-16 13:03:12] jleyba: I might have missed an edge case there  (had problems with that one)
[2014-01-16 13:03:43] nplatt: jimevans: "timeout" specifies the max duration between commands from the client to the hub
[2014-01-16 13:04:21] jleyba: that's a selenium 1 concept, isn't it?
[2014-01-16 13:05:02] nplatt: "browserTimeout" is described as the "number of seconds a browser is allowed to hang"
[2014-01-16 13:05:18] jleyba: described where/
[2014-01-16 13:05:21] nplatt: jleyba: I'm using 2.39
[2014-01-16 13:05:37] nplatt: java -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone-2.39.jar -h |& less
[2014-01-16 13:06:05] nplatt: fwiw, the value is actually in milliseconds
[2014-01-16 13:06:11] jimevans: jleyba: so i'm getting back the mouse state from the atom, but the property names are minified. this is fine, as long as all atoms will use the same minified property names.
