[2014-01-08 09:16:25] nirvdrum: Okay.  Well, given I've yet to actually build a release, I probably shouldn't have a strong say (or any), but we're getting pretty close to not being able to do downloads on gcode anymore.

[2014-01-08 09:18:07] nirvdrum: I have concerns about GitHub continuing to provide this service, since they too removed downloads at one point.  And I thought someone said you couldn't attach additional artifacts after the release had been created.
[2014-01-08 09:18:14] lukeis: whatever we decide someone will need to update 'push_release' target ;)
[2014-01-08 09:18:16] nirvdrum: But, we're a week out from the cutoff.
[2014-01-08 09:18:32] nirvdrum: So 2.39 was likely the last download on gcode.
