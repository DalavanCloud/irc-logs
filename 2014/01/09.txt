[2014-01-09 04:00:13] barancev: or Java/C# ?
[2014-01-09 04:00:17] skoop: hm, I guess I could just set up something simple to try and connect
[2014-01-09 04:00:49] barancev: no languages other than PHP ready to use?
[2014-01-09 04:01:23] skoop: not on this development machine
[2014-01-09 04:01:35] barancev: then, try this selenium client library: https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver
[2014-01-09 04:01:37] skoop: unfortunately, the customer uses developers virtual servers
[2014-01-09 04:02:35] barancev: it is easier to understand the failure cause if you use a simple client

[2014-01-09 04:06:03] barancev: just to check connection is not blocked
[2014-01-09 04:06:20] barancev: or even simple 'telnet localhost 4444' from the console
[2014-01-09 04:06:39] skoop: I get connection refused
[2014-01-09 04:07:31] barancev: so please check your network settings and look what's blocking the road
[2014-01-09 04:07:56] barancev: firewalls, proxies, custom route settings etc
[2014-01-09 04:08:59] skoop: I already checked for iptables, there's none. and since I'm connecting to 127.0.0.1/localhost, is there really anything else there could be in between?
[2014-01-09 04:10:35] skoop: no strange routing, ifconfig shows local loopback 127.0.0.1
[2014-01-09 04:10:56] barancev: sure, a local firewall can block connections to the port 4444, a system proxy can redirect all connections to the proxy server
[2014-01-09 04:12:00] skoop: wait, I'm just going to install it on my own machine first, see if I can get stuff up and running that way

[2014-01-09 09:02:00] simonstewart: 3) Write a new runner for the html-suite tests

[2014-01-09 09:15:17] nirvdrum: Unless I just need to update my gem.  I'm on 2.37 right now.
[2014-01-09 09:15:34] lukeis: no, that's been there a long time… i don't know ruby well enough to help more
[2014-01-09 09:15:53] nirvdrum: Yeah.  I think it changed recently.
[2014-01-09 09:16:12] nirvdrum: The HTTP client setup seems to have completely changed.  I'll need to go through the history.
[2014-01-09 09:16:24] nirvdrum: Passing in my own client works, so I can just do that, too.
[2014-01-09 09:17:15] lukeis: this hasn't been changed in a long time ;) https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/http/default.rb#L25   but I can't say about other areas that call it
[2014-01-09 09:17:35] d0x: Dude-X: over which API? Currently i do smth. like new FirefoxProvile.setPreferences("general.useragent.override", ...") and then new FirefoxDriver(myFakedUserAgentProfile)
[2014-01-09 09:17:45] d0x: And then after instatiation, i cant change it any longer
[2014-01-09 09:18:33] Dude-X: you want to change it live?
[2014-01-09 09:18:41] d0x: Dude-X: yap
[2014-01-09 09:18:47] Dude-X: that i don't know how to do.
[2014-01-09 09:18:55] Dude-X: i suppose you can do it in browser.....
[2014-01-09 09:19:00] Dude-X: but it's really slow.
[2014-01-09 09:19:02] nirvdrum: lukeis: Yeah, that happens too late.  But I can use that to create my own client.
[2014-01-09 09:19:16] nirvdrum: I could be crazy, but I thought you could pass the timeout in when you requested the driver instance.
[2014-01-09 09:19:21] nirvdrum: Maybe that was an RC thing.
[2014-01-09 09:19:26] d0x: Dude-X: It is not for unittests, so time is not a problem
[2014-01-09 09:19:38] nirvdrum: I haven't needed to worry about the startup timeout up until now.  Selendroid can be slow to start up.
[2014-01-09 09:20:08] lukeis: nirvdrum: keep the emulators hot?
[2014-01-09 09:20:24] Dude-X: see if you can do get('about:config') and if that works, you can change the agent via webdriver
[2014-01-09 09:20:25] lukeis: (you're not having selendroid start an emulator are you?)
[2014-01-09 09:20:26] Dude-X: otherwise, change your test runner so that the setup can start a new instance of firefox
[2014-01-09 09:20:28] Dude-X: or use a proxy

[2014-01-09 09:20:58] nirvdrum: lukeis: This is my first time using it.  When I had the emulator already running, it refused to enumerate the device, saying it was already in use.
[2014-01-09 09:21:04] nirvdrum: I haven't looked deeper than that.
[2014-01-09 09:21:10] nirvdrum: I'm still on the getting started guide.
[2014-01-09 09:21:22] lukeis: that only happens if you didn't call driver.quit() after the first time running
[2014-01-09 09:22:25] nirvdrum: Don't worry.  I'm sure I'll have plenty of questions for you in #selendroid :-)
[2014-01-09 09:22:33] lukeis: nirvdrum: have you tried chromedriver for android? I would image that to be right up your alley for what you're doing… unless you're trying to support old api levels
[2014-01-09 09:23:39] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-09 09:23:40] lukeis: I think if you install chrome.apk on 'old' versions of android (well, versions that chrome itself supports) you can run chromedriver too
[2014-01-09 09:23:48] nirvdrum: All I've done thus far was use that test APK to make sure things started.
[2014-01-09 09:23:52] nirvdrum: I'll need to give that a look soon.
[2014-01-09 09:24:12] nirvdrum: I need to figure out what will run on the x86 ABI too.

[2014-01-09 09:54:56] simonstewart: My answer would be "ask the googlers on the project nicely"
[2014-01-09 09:55:01] lukeis: thus why i think we are on a 1 week critical path ;)
[2014-01-09 09:55:25] simonstewart: thus why I think we have longer :)
[2014-01-09 09:55:59] lukeis: well then in 1 week can you square away a contact on the google code project that will be willing to do this for us past deadline?
[2014-01-09 09:56:11] lukeis: otherwise I'm assuming we won't be able to

[2014-01-09 14:51:01] Dude-X: but some landlords resort to illegal means
[2014-01-09 14:51:20] Dude-X: but yes, there are still working class areas but it's being squeezed out
[2014-01-09 14:51:26] davidlai: Lol, even Wall St. is too expensive for Wall St.  (Most of those old bank buildings are been converted into High end apartments.)
[2014-01-09 14:51:42] Dude-X: downtown apartments are tiny AND expensive
[2014-01-09 14:51:52] Dude-X: it's ridiculous
[2014-01-09 14:52:01] Dude-X: it's mostly bankers and lawyers that live there
[2014-01-09 14:52:48] AutomatedTester: from what I have heard from people Parkslope is the place to be
[2014-01-09 14:52:52] AutomatedTester: but I have no idea
[2014-01-09 14:52:52] Dude-X: although some apartments are decent size and give you wonderful virews
[2014-01-09 14:52:59] Dude-X: Park Slope is in Brooklyn
[2014-01-09 14:53:11] lukeis: my cousin used to live there, i liked it when i visited
[2014-01-09 14:53:15] Dude-X: it has many Brownstones
[2014-01-09 14:53:20] Dude-X: hipsters
[2014-01-09 14:53:26] Dude-X: Patrick stewart i think
[2014-01-09 14:53:27] lukeis: heh
[2014-01-09 14:53:39] Dude-X: but it's also ridiculously overpriced
[2014-01-09 14:53:40] lukeis: it's like a mini east coast San Francisco ;)
[2014-01-09 14:53:57] AutomatedTester: that explains why the people I know like it then
[2014-01-09 14:54:21] Dude-X: it's kind of weird to think of Park Slope as hipster villa. When i was growing up, most of brookyln was crime ridden
[2014-01-09 14:54:42] Dude-X: like Williamsburg, which is now a hipster neighborhood

[2014-01-09 14:58:44] lukeis: younger people flock to 'cheap' areas and turn them into hipster towns :) (the mission used to be cheaper, and so it filled up with hipsters and now that the prices have risen, the richer hipsters flock there :) )
[2014-01-09 15:00:19] Dude-X: but what happened in the last 15 years is they have jacked up the rents
[2014-01-09 15:00:35] Dude-X: if a neighborhood had an average rent of 1000
[2014-01-09 15:01:05] Dude-X: as soon as the landlord discovers that their tenants make good money, they jack up the future rents to 1500
[2014-01-09 15:01:21] Dude-X: now a closet in manhattan is 3330 for a single bedroom
[2014-01-09 15:02:20] lukeis: yeah, most of manhattan is ridiculous

[2014-01-09 15:03:16] Dude-X: when not too long ago it used to be 1200-1300

[2014-01-09 15:08:11] Dude-X: but kind of hard to make that work in NYC when people are somewhat distrustful of each other
