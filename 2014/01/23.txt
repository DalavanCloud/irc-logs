[2014-01-23 06:22:17] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 06:24:12] kallisti: so most webdriver servers throw a timeout exception on script timeout right? but there's also a script_timeout exception. Is that also used?
[2014-01-23 06:24:27] kallisti: orthagonal1_: what language?
[2014-01-23 06:24:51] kallisti: if it's just a typical POSIX socket then webdriver is not really the tool for that. webdriver is used for testing browser interaction with websites.

[2014-01-23 06:40:02] orthagonal1_: kallisti: socket.io is javascript-based it is intended to run in the browser on the client, but it doesn't do DOM manipulations.  my hunch is selenium is solely concerned with monitoring DOM?
[2014-01-23 06:40:36] kallisti: it's an interface that allows you to perform actions in a browser. It's not entirely DOM focused but that is part of it.

[2014-01-23 06:43:59] nirvdrum: How's that revolution going over there, anyway?
[2014-01-23 06:44:05] orthagonal1_: kallisti: thanks for the response, i'm new to webdriver so the only part of it i know about yet is the DOM interactions and simulated user events.  i'll keep digging though i may have to settle for making a debug version of the page that does a DOM modification that shows the text of the incoming json and check against that
[2014-01-23 06:44:06] nirvdrum: They're not going to let you back into the States.

[2014-01-23 06:44:17] llaskin: kiev
[2014-01-23 06:45:24] kallisti: orthagonal1_: ah so you're an HTTP request to retrieve JSON data? You could probably just test that using some kind of Java HTTP client library combined with a Java JSON parser.
[2014-01-23 06:45:24] orthagonal1_: llaskin: i've seen some crazy footage out of kiev yesterday i hope its not all crazy where you are
[2014-01-23 06:45:46] llaskin: nah its fine
[2014-01-23 06:45:51] llaskin: i'm only here for 2 more days
[2014-01-23 06:45:54] llaskin: as long as they let my plane out!
[2014-01-23 06:46:30] kallisti: orthagonal1_: parsing JSON in Java is a little weird (in my opinion), but if you're comfortable with Java it's probably straightforward.
[2014-01-23 06:46:57] orthagonal1_: socket.io is pure TCP no HTTP overhead.  I'm actually using jasmine (javascript) for everything (it's a node.js based project)

[2014-01-23 08:52:35] jimevans: what's happening, i suspect, is that phantomjs is passing back an illegal string in the 'platform' property of the capabilities object that describes the session. however, the DesiredCapabilities constructor specifically catches the ArgumentException if the string isn't part of the enum.
[2014-01-23 08:52:53] jleyba: jarib: wtf? I don't remember seeing that.  merge conflict?

[2014-01-23 09:25:19] llaskin: hi manoj
[2014-01-23 09:26:18] preinheimer: So I've got my thing running now, executing tests. It's nifty. But it works even if I don't run the selenium server jar first. Which has me very confused. Does the python webdriver code just have all it needs, the selenium server thing is unnecesary?
[2014-01-23 09:27:18] Dude-X: the jar is only for remote webdriver
[2014-01-23 09:27:25] Dude-X: or running old RC code

[2014-01-23 09:29:37] cgoldberg: preinheimer, yea.. running local python webdriver, you don't need the java server at all
[2014-01-23 09:34:40] preinheimer: I feel like I've been bamboozled.
[2014-01-23 09:34:49] preinheimer: on the upside. everything works

[2014-01-23 09:42:20] cgoldberg: preinheimer, so with the server, you can run that jar on an arbitrary machine on your network... and instantiate RemoteWebdriver, and viola, tests run on remote machine instead of local.
[2014-01-23 09:42:29] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 09:42:58] cgoldberg: i personally don't use grid or remote webdriver... so I never ever use the server piece

[2014-01-23 12:35:18] HowardwLo: dimacus: if its a fail page, there will be an element with class errormessage
[2014-01-23 12:35:27] HowardwLo: if its not, it'll have "successbutton"
[2014-01-23 12:35:50] dimacus: HowardwLo: what language?
[2014-01-23 12:36:15] HowardwLo: python
[2014-01-23 12:36:42] dimacus: hmmm close but not sure how to do it in python, so i'll show you in Ruby and Java and let you figure out rest?
[2014-01-23 12:37:09] dimacus: HowardwLo: here is ruby example from RubyBindings
[2014-01-23 12:37:10] dimacus: # wait for a specific element to show up
[2014-01-23 12:37:10] dimacus: wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => 10) # seconds
[2014-01-23 12:37:10] dimacus: wait.until { driver.find_element(:id => "foo") }
[2014-01-23 12:37:13] dimacus: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings
[2014-01-23 12:37:33] HowardwLo: it waits for two possible signals
[2014-01-23 12:37:34] dimacus: Here is Java example
[2014-01-23 12:37:34] dimacus: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(webDriver, timeoutInSeconds);
[2014-01-23 12:37:34] dimacus: wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id<locator>));
[2014-01-23 12:37:50] lukeis: python has the waits too
[2014-01-23 12:37:53] dimacus: HowardwLo: put an "or" there
[2014-01-23 12:38:08] dimacus: wait for element1 to be visble or element2 to be visible

[2014-01-23 12:40:57] lukeis: HowardwLo: but if element1 doesn't ever exist that will timeout and you'll need to rework the lambda
[2014-01-23 12:41:08] HowardwLo: is there a catch all for errors?
[2014-01-23 12:41:21] HowardwLo: lukeis: it switches off between element1 or element 2
[2014-01-23 12:41:25] HowardwLo: both will never be displayed :(
[2014-01-23 12:41:28] lukeis: the 'until' method catches ElementNotFound
[2014-01-23 12:41:38] lukeis: do they exist in the DOM though?
[2014-01-23 12:42:01] lukeis: or one will exist or the other will exist?

[2014-01-23 12:48:25] HowardwLo: its a… either a or b

[2014-01-23 13:34:30] santiycr: jimevans:  how do I check?
[2014-01-23 13:34:37] santiycr: in the internet options, registry?
[2014-01-23 13:34:39] dimacus: LarryAlso: Step 1: http://i.imgur.com/M99tow9.jpg
[2014-01-23 13:35:07] jimevans: santiycr: i honestly don't know where that setting is stored in the registry.
[2014-01-23 13:35:24] jimevans: in internet options, you'd find it in the advanced tab.
[2014-01-23 13:35:43] santiycr: ok, looking
[2014-01-23 13:36:01] LarryAlso: dimacus: I know how to insert the command, I don't know the xpath or css selector to give the command.

[2014-01-23 13:38:32] LarryAlso: Right mouse click on the area of what you want to inspect and select "inspect elements'
[2014-01-23 13:39:04] santiycr: jimevans: can that change affect any sauce users?
[2014-01-23 13:39:16] dimacus: LarryAlso: perfect, in that case i'll jump straight into it, I assume you know how to find the ID of a given link or button?
[2014-01-23 13:39:20] santiycr: I mean, have IE behave differently than they expect?

[2014-01-23 13:40:15] jimevans: santiycr: shouldn't. or at least no more differently than if regular protected mode is set in the options for the different zones.
[2014-01-23 13:40:32] santiycr: jimevans:  ok, I'll make a task in our list
[2014-01-23 13:40:45] LarryAlso: in my case it is ,input_id="txtLastName" type="text" tableindex="4"...blah...blah
[2014-01-23 13:40:54] LarryAlso: ,=<
[2014-01-23 13:41:24] dimacus: LarryAlso: ok in that case try this:
[2014-01-23 13:41:53] dimacus: command: type, target: css=#txtLastName, value: blah
[2014-01-23 13:42:27] LarryAlso: use everything after command:, right?
[2014-01-23 13:42:50] dimacus: no, i tried to seporate the 3 parameters of the command with comma
[2014-01-23 13:42:56] dimacus: as in command is type
[2014-01-23 13:43:06] LarryAlso: i see
[2014-01-23 13:43:11] dimacus: and you want to put it into target of "css=#txtLastName"
[2014-01-23 13:43:34] LarryAlso: okay, give a minute...I am going to try this step...btw...thanks a lot.
[2014-01-23 13:43:57] dimacus: LarryAlso: basically you want to read up on CSS selectors and XPath, if you do that, you will never have trouble clicking on anything ever again
[2014-01-23 13:44:21] LarryAlso: okay...where can I find that information...in the help file?
[2014-01-23 13:44:58] dimacus: LarryAlso: one sec, let me find a simple tutoria
[2014-01-23 13:45:23] dimacus: LarryAlso: this one looks pretty good http://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors
[2014-01-23 13:46:43] dimacus: LarryAlso: also intro to XPath http://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/selenium-xpath-marks-the-spot
[2014-01-23 13:47:13] dimacus: LarryAlso: finally… shot in the dark, but if you are still have trouble clicking on things… find out if you are using iFrames on the page
[2014-01-23 13:48:22] dimacus: LarryAlso: but stick to CSS selector, it's more stable in long run

[2014-01-23 14:05:41] lukeis: rationale*
[2014-01-23 14:06:07] AutomatedTester: by busy work you mean Github making their issue tracker not be shit?

[2014-01-23 14:06:34] AutomatedTester: github issues makes bugzilla look amazing
[2014-01-23 14:06:52] lukeis: i would be +1 for moving all our issues to a bugzilla instance
[2014-01-23 14:06:59] nirvdrum: I really, really wish GitHub would let you set a URL for your issue tracker so if you don't use theirs, you'd still have the Issues link and it'd go someplace useful.
[2014-01-23 14:07:18] lukeis: feature request?
[2014-01-23 14:07:25] nirvdrum: I've been asking for it for years.
[2014-01-23 14:07:46] lukeis: know any dev's at github? I'm sure they could make it happen
[2014-01-23 14:08:01] nirvdrum: They'd rather truncate my commit messages and move everything useful to cryptic icons on the side, while giving me a color band that somehow correlates to programming languages.
[2014-01-23 14:08:19] lukeis: heh
[2014-01-23 14:08:40] lukeis: i pay no mind to the 'gamification' part… i think it says I'm an html coder still
[2014-01-23 14:09:25] nirvdrum: lukeis: Yeah, but that region at the top of the project used to be useful :-/

[2014-01-23 14:11:03] *lukeis takes jabs at everyone by pointing out how much they actually contribute to the Selenium project in the past, oh year? :)'
[2014-01-23 14:11:14] nirvdrum: I guess it's basically as bad as it's going to be.
[2014-01-23 14:11:30] nirvdrum: lukeis: That's a fair point.  That's why I deferred to you on the downloads location.
[2014-01-23 14:11:56] nirvdrum: I think a reasonable balance needs to be struck between those actively developing and whatever we hope to foster as a community.
[2014-01-23 14:12:10] lukeis: yes, i agree :)
[2014-01-23 14:12:21] nirvdrum: Which is why I'll likely change my vote to GitHub.  And I expect the issue tracker to become a complete shit show.
[2014-01-23 14:12:36] lukeis: it is a complete shit show ;)
[2014-01-23 14:12:53] nirvdrum: It's a reasonably managed shit show now.
[2014-01-23 14:13:05] lukeis: barancev|2 is the only reason it is "managed" somehow right now
[2014-01-23 14:13:11] nirvdrum: Yeah, things just randomly pop up when you start typing.
[2014-01-23 14:13:32] nirvdrum: Well, you know, you can do things like CC people without having to mention them in a comment.
[2014-01-23 14:13:45] lukeis: yep, that's a feature I like
[2014-01-23 14:13:51] lukeis: but that actually is a comment
[2014-01-23 14:14:11] lukeis: adding the cc is effectively doing the same exact thing
[2014-01-23 14:14:27] nirvdrum: It shows up in the issue audit trail.
[2014-01-23 14:14:36] nirvdrum: It's different to me.
[2014-01-23 14:14:37] lukeis: (which looks like a comment)

[2014-01-23 14:15:15] nirvdrum: And I can't stand emoji and animated gifs in issue comments.
[2014-01-23 14:15:28] lukeis: and I don't think you can restrict an issue from getting more comments in GH
[2014-01-23 14:16:01] lukeis: that restrict comments feature is quite nice in GC to mute the thread ;)

[2014-01-23 14:16:37] nirvdrum: But I think some of this is just philosophical.  I love JIRA.  Most people that love GH Issues hate JIRA.
[2014-01-23 14:16:40] lukeis: but honestly I don't know why we need a "one-stop shop"

[2014-01-23 14:17:24] nirvdrum: I agree.  Other than if you don't use GH Issues, but you host on GH, people tend to think you don't have an issue tracker.  Because they need to read the README and most people on the Internet can't be bothered to do that.
[2014-01-23 14:17:48] lukeis: we don't want those people logging issues anyways ;)
[2014-01-23 14:17:58] nirvdrum: Or they get personally offended by needing to create an account someplace else.
[2014-01-23 14:18:11] p00j4, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:18:11] lukeis: again, my previous statement :)
[2014-01-23 14:18:26] nirvdrum: The JRuby team wrestled with this quite a bit.
[2014-01-23 14:18:27] awilson820, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:18:47] nirvdrum: They eventually gave in and shutdown their JIRA system and promoted GH Issues as the tracker.
[2014-01-23 14:18:49] lukeis: we have a very low signal to noise ratio in the issues list
[2014-01-23 14:19:14] Oscar, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:19:31] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:19:47] nirvdrum: I just want the decision to be made somewhat objectively.
[2014-01-23 14:19:56] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:19:59] lukeis: i'm ok with that :)
[2014-01-23 14:20:10] lukeis: as it looks, we'll be staying with the status-quo
[2014-01-23 14:20:26] nirvdrum: "GitHub is the trend" isn't a great reason to move to me.
[2014-01-23 14:20:34] nirvdrum: SourceForge was the trend at one point, too.
[2014-01-23 14:20:40] lukeis: i agree
[2014-01-23 14:20:45] nirvdrum: 5 years from now, I expect the next GitHub to be out there.
[2014-01-23 14:20:52] lukeis: (although i never like sourceforge)
[2014-01-23 14:21:02] lukeis: liked*
[2014-01-23 14:21:12] nirvdrum: krosenvold____ made a strong argument in that this is GitHub's focus, so they're less likely to kill off important things than gcode is.
[2014-01-23 14:21:25] awilson8201, quitting. (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[2014-01-23 14:21:29] lukeis: +1 to that argument too
[2014-01-23 14:22:07] nirvdrum: Bonus points for not glossing over the fact that GitHub has historically killed off some useful stuff, like the downloads feature.
[2014-01-23 14:22:12] santiycr: come one guys, we don't spend nearly enough time fixing bugs to give a crap about bug trackers
[2014-01-23 14:22:15] jleyba: gcode is still the front for chromium.  pretty big canary in the coal mine there :)
[2014-01-23 14:22:23] santiycr: (fanboy mode on)
[2014-01-23 14:22:30] nirvdrum: YES.  He's here!
[2014-01-23 14:22:32] santiycr: (troll mode engaging)
[2014-01-23 14:22:47] lukeis: jleyba: umm… chromium is google though
[2014-01-23 14:23:08] nirvdrum: santiycr: You do make a good point. I hated the gcode tracker so much, I basically stopped triaging, whereas I was reasonably active with in JIRA.
[2014-01-23 14:23:27] nirvdrum: If I don't get CC'd on an issue, I usually don't bother looking.
[2014-01-23 14:23:28] santiycr: I think it is a discussion worth having
[2014-01-23 14:23:54] santiycr: maybe the approach we're taking to bug reports isn't sustainable
[2014-01-23 14:23:57] nirvdrum: But I find the GitHub Issue tracker even worse for actual planning or searching or virtually anything useful.
[2014-01-23 14:24:20] santiycr: that's because github isn't about issue tracking
[2014-01-23 14:24:36] santiycr: they just built that in for people who kept asking where the issue tracking is
[2014-01-23 14:24:40] lukeis: it's supposed to be about collaborating ;)
[2014-01-23 14:24:56] santiycr: yup
[2014-01-23 14:25:14] lukeis: but most people don't know enough or aren't willing to take the time to learn how to make changes to Selenium
[2014-01-23 14:25:22] santiycr: if we think we need a nasa-grade issue tracker, then lets build it
[2014-01-23 14:25:25] santiycr: (I don't)
[2014-01-23 14:25:32] nirvdrum: How else would you collaborate?  Without the issue tracker, it's just a glorified file repository.
[2014-01-23 14:25:50] rebelagentm, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-01-23 14:26:03] santiycr: forks and pull requests have worked pretty well for appium
[2014-01-23 14:26:05] nirvdrum: santiycr: I find this to be infinitely more useful: https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/issues?status=new&status=open
[2014-01-23 14:26:17] santiycr: nirvdrum:  https://github.com/appium/appium
[2014-01-23 14:26:20] nirvdrum: Pull requests are layered on top of the issue tracker.
[2014-01-23 14:26:27] santiycr: 621 forks
[2014-01-23 14:26:39] nirvdrum: Also, their merge model for pull requests leaves a lot to be desired.
[2014-01-23 14:26:41] lukeis: santiycr: i'd say the issues list on appium has grown out of control though
[2014-01-23 14:27:09] jimevans: santiycr: my issue isn't with having a "nasa-grade issue tracker". rather, i care about having good, reproducible issue reports. which we don't
[2014-01-23 14:27:20] nirvdrum: Holy crap.  My eyes just got raped by a rainbow: https://github.com/appium/appium/issues
[2014-01-23 14:27:35] lukeis: lol
[2014-01-23 14:27:43] santiycr: nirvdrum:  let me help you out
[2014-01-23 14:27:48] santiycr: here's the bible to bore you again: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list
[2014-01-23 14:27:55] jleyba: jimevans: are you suggesting we make users pass the turing test before they can post an issue?
[2014-01-23 14:27:57] santiycr: good luck reading through it
[2014-01-23 14:27:57] jleyba: >:)
[2014-01-23 14:28:12] santiycr: jleyba:  YES, THAT!
[2014-01-23 14:28:19] lukeis: +1 to a turing test ;)
[2014-01-23 14:28:22] nirvdrum: santiycr: I think the bitbucket tracker represents a good middle-ground.
[2014-01-23 14:28:24] jimevans: jleyba: :)
[2014-01-23 14:28:33] santiycr: our problem is that reporting issues is our audience's job
[2014-01-23 14:28:39] santiycr: and they are very happy to over do it
[2014-01-23 14:28:52] jleyba: We just need to take a stand
[2014-01-23 14:28:54] nirvdrum: jimevans, jleyba: Didn't jarib have some script that auto-closed issues out that we didn't hear back from after 3 weeks or something?
[2014-01-23 14:29:07] lukeis: it was very flawed
[2014-01-23 14:29:07] jleyba: if your issue boils down to "It no work", we should close it.  Not mark it "Needs Clarification" and leave it there
[2014-01-23 14:29:26] santiycr: nirvdrum:  I think bitbucket looks better, but not impressive enough
[2014-01-23 14:29:46] lukeis: yeah, we are often too easy on our users… no repro steps? closed.
[2014-01-23 14:30:03] AutomatedTester: santiycr: are you suggesting that github issues is impressive?
[2014-01-23 14:30:16] nirvdrum: I'm fine with that, as long as it's polite.  Indicate they can re-open when they have the reproduction steps.
[2014-01-23 14:30:29] lukeis: the problem is users can't reopen
[2014-01-23 14:30:41] jleyba: lukeis: they can file new
[2014-01-23 14:30:45] santiycr: AutomatedTester: I'm suggesting that I don't give a shit about the issue tracker
[2014-01-23 14:30:53] santiycr: I care about the community
[2014-01-23 14:30:54] lukeis: jleyba: yeah, that's just annoying though
[2014-01-23 14:31:17] nirvdrum: santiycr: Well, we accept PRs through the GH mirror now . . .
[2014-01-23 14:31:18] santiycr: the one that has a positive impact in the project, not the one that creates bug reports when selenium IDE doesn't record their drag and drop
[2014-01-23 14:31:22] santiycr: and then never checks back
[2014-01-23 14:31:41] jleyba: IDE should be a separate project
[2014-01-23 14:31:50] santiycr: that too
[2014-01-23 14:32:03] jleyba: it's a totally separate class of project with an entirely different user base...
[2014-01-23 14:32:08] jleyba: not to derail the conversation though :)
[2014-01-23 14:32:32] santiycr: but that's not my point, my point is that to help us be able to handle a ridiculous amount of useless bug reports, we're adding complexity to the ramp up process for new help
[2014-01-23 14:32:54] santiycr: yeah, I know we take pull request and we host on github
[2014-01-23 14:33:19] santiycr: but it's not as transparent and shiny as it would be if we just said: fork, play around, send pull requests, become a committer in 5 minutes
[2014-01-23 14:33:32] nirvdrum: I'm not trying to be a dick, but if you don't care about the issue tracker, isn't that good enough?
[2014-01-23 14:33:47] LarryAlso, quitting. ()
[2014-01-23 14:33:53] nirvdrum: Well, given that we require a CLA, that 5 min. thing is never going to happen.
[2014-01-23 14:33:55] jleyba: "send pull requests, become a committer in 5 minutes" - no
[2014-01-23 14:34:07] nirvdrum: Unless by committer you literally mean you're able to commit locally.
[2014-01-23 14:34:08] santiycr: yeah, we should get rid of the CLA
[2014-01-23 14:34:16] nirvdrum: Absolutely not.
[2014-01-23 14:34:21] jleyba: that's a legal safe guard
[2014-01-23 14:34:22] AutomatedTester: what a silly idea
[2014-01-23 14:34:29] jimevans: no way in hell should we get rid of the cla
[2014-01-23 14:34:39] santiycr: sorry, I guess I meant a contributor
[2014-01-23 14:34:43] lukeis: appium is not doing itself a service by not having a cla
[2014-01-23 14:34:45] jleyba: angular uses a script to auto-update their pull requests with whether someone has signed the cla
[2014-01-23 14:34:52] jleyba: pretty sure they put it up on github too
[2014-01-23 14:34:52] davehunt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-23 14:34:52] nirvdrum: If anything, GitHub should make a CLA an easy part of the PR process.  Every project should have them.
[2014-01-23 14:34:53] lukeis: ios-driver and selendroid also have CLA's
[2014-01-23 14:35:13] nirvdrum: Apache tied it into their JIRA, which was kinda nice.
[2014-01-23 14:35:21] nirvdrum: There's this, but I've never used it: http://www.clahub.com/
[2014-01-23 14:35:30] santiycr: I didn't mean to make this about the CLA
[2014-01-23 14:35:57] jleyba: https://github.com/angular/google-cla-verifier-for-github
[2014-01-23 14:36:05] nirvdrum: santiycr: You just wanted the rest of us to unify on something.
[2014-01-23 14:36:23] santiycr: guess so
[2014-01-23 14:36:26] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2014-01-23 14:36:32] jimevans: santiycr: i know you didn't but i find it unrealistic to expect "fork, submit pull request, become a contributor" to ever become a 5-minute procedure for this project.
[2014-01-23 14:36:49] santiycr: if you keep pushing, I'll suggest rewriting the codebase in go
[2014-01-23 14:37:02] lukeis: LOL… go ahead :)
[2014-01-23 14:37:17] santiycr: jimevans: I sill don't understand why we cant have that be the case
[2014-01-23 14:37:18] jleyba: as we give more people commit rights, the need for more discipline increases
[2014-01-23 14:38:08] nirvdrum: +1
[2014-01-23 14:38:11] santiycr: sorry, I'm not talking about push rights, I'm talking about contributing
[2014-01-23 14:38:20] jimevans: santiycr: to even grok the simplest part of the code base, let alone be able to build any significant portion of it is longer than a 5 minute procedure. and what's more, you know that.
[2014-01-23 14:38:21] *lukeis side added bonus for migrating the project to a new service, people who had the commit bit and let it rot are left behind...'
[2014-01-23 14:38:22] nirvdrum: Almost all my grid work these days is unrolling things others did :-/
[2014-01-23 14:39:10] santiycr: nirvdrum: how do those contributions come?
[2014-01-23 14:39:28] nirvdrum: Through other contributors.
[2014-01-23 14:39:34] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:39:47] nirvdrum: Which is why I'm reticent to mass grant push rights.
[2014-01-23 14:39:50] *lukeis thanks $diety that I haven't broken things for nirvdrum yet'
[2014-01-23 14:39:53] santiycr: I don't know what that even means
[2014-01-23 14:40:37] nirvdrum: As we've increased the number of contributors, the damage we've done to ourselves has gone up.  Moreorless what jleyba said.  I just put it in concrete terms.
[2014-01-23 14:41:04] AutomatedTester: santiycr: so with a github, bitbucket, gitorious, what can people submit things, since that is the way git is designed. You pull from remote branches
[2014-01-23 14:41:16] AutomatedTester: santiycr: or is it a simple case of wanting the green button?
[2014-01-23 14:41:39] nirvdrum: I.e., I think the gating process of a pull request is actually the perfect balance between letting people contribute and not letting total anarchy to reign Hell upon us.
[2014-01-23 14:41:50] santiycr: guys, did I say this wasn't about push right, but contribution?
[2014-01-23 14:41:55] santiycr: yeah, that!
[2014-01-23 14:42:05] lukeis: i dislike that GC doesn't have a decent way for a pull request… patch files to the issues suck
[2014-01-23 14:42:28] AutomatedTester: people can give us links to their remote branch
[2014-01-23 14:42:35] AutomatedTester: it doesnt need to be a patch file
[2014-01-23 14:42:37] nirvdrum: santiycr: Sorry, maybe I got confused.  I'll back to my original question then.  If you don't care about the issue tracker, what does moving everything over to GitHub buy us that the mirror doesn't?  I think there's a distinction there that I'm missing.
[2014-01-23 14:42:41] santiycr: let's use a good example of a big project
[2014-01-23 14:42:42] santiycr: https://github.com/angular/angular.js
[2014-01-23 14:42:48] santiycr: (google project, hosted on github)
[2014-01-23 14:43:06] santiycr: every pull request triggers a build, gets marked as blue
[2014-01-23 14:43:11] santiycr: or green, whatever
[2014-01-23 14:43:27] santiycr: developers review the commit diff, see that it has tests and that the build passes with them
[2014-01-23 14:43:29] santiycr: then they merge
[2014-01-23 14:43:32] lukeis: AutomatedTester: GC doesn't make it easy or obvious to do so...
[2014-01-23 14:44:14] AutomatedTester: lukeis: but knowing git means you should know that you can do this
[2014-01-23 14:44:45] lukeis: yeah, people don't (obviously in my experience) know git when trying to contribute to us
[2014-01-23 14:44:57] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester, lukeis: I can buy the argument that without an innate mechanism, it introduces a hurdle or sends a mixed signal.
[2014-01-23 14:45:57] lukeis: but with the current mirror, pull requests are ok… it's just the users who don't know we have the mirror (or don't know git / github) that cause the problem (for me)
[2014-01-23 14:46:35] santiycr: when it comes to contribution, angular asks for pull requests:
[2014-01-23 14:46:36] santiycr: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[2014-01-23 14:47:10] santiycr: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request
[2014-01-23 14:47:15] santiycr: and yeah, they ask for a CLA
[2014-01-23 14:47:49] santiycr: to pick a random example, you can see how discussions about contributions happen around the pull request
[2014-01-23 14:47:50] santiycr: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/5960
[2014-01-23 14:48:01] santiycr: as well as details about the build passing with it
[2014-01-23 14:48:14] santiycr: (I know our build is more complicated, but that's something we can still fix)
[2014-01-23 14:48:32] jleyba: asking for pull requests through github doesn't fix the problem of github's diff/code review UI being complete crap :)
[2014-01-23 14:48:34] nirvdrum: lukeis: Thanks for answering my question.
[2014-01-23 14:48:46] jleyba: That's why I don't review pull requests more often
[2014-01-23 14:49:08] lukeis: nirvdrum: which question? :)
[2014-01-23 14:49:10] jarib: nirvdrum: i never wrote that script auto-close script, though we did talk about it
[2014-01-23 14:49:27] nirvdrum: lukeis: What the difference is if we already mirror on GitHub.
[2014-01-23 14:49:36] lukeis: ah ha
[2014-01-23 14:49:48] Oscar, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-23 14:50:00] jarib: lukeis: i like that you remember it being "very flawed" :)
[2014-01-23 14:50:14] lukeis: :)
[2014-01-23 14:50:15] nirvdrum: To Simon's other point, Bitbucket would make a mercurial migration easier if we went down that road.  I suspect working at Facebook has him thinking about it.
[2014-01-23 14:50:15] stackedsax, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-23 14:50:22] santiycr: sorry, gotta focus on work right now
[2014-01-23 14:50:22] *jarib reads the backlog'
[2014-01-23 14:50:34] santiycr: you guys keep going
[2014-01-23 14:50:38] santiycr: and stay awesome
[2014-01-23 14:50:47] nirvdrum: Oh, the "taking the high road" slam.
[2014-01-23 14:50:56] lukeis: jarib: i just remember pointing out a flaw of closing old NeedsClarification and not handling if users had actually followed up with a comment or not
[2014-01-23 14:51:01] nirvdrum: Later santiycr.
[2014-01-23 14:51:15] lukeis: lol
[2014-01-23 14:51:29] AutomatedTester: i use mercurial everyday on Firefox
[2014-01-23 14:51:30] jarib: nirvdrum <3
[2014-01-23 14:51:32] AutomatedTester: I quite like it
[2014-01-23 14:51:50] AutomatedTester: and the work that facebook has done to the mercurial project has been awesome
[2014-01-23 14:51:54] bluescreen10, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-01-23 14:52:12] lukeis: i could be convinced…. but I quite like not having to switch SCM's much right now… my brain has already purged svn commands
[2014-01-23 14:52:31] nirvdrum: I'll put it as succinctly as I can: on the whole, I think we'd be better off if we moved to GitHub, but I don't think it's the best we can do.
[2014-01-23 14:52:31] lukeis: git and p4 (and I'd love to get rid of p4… but … work.)
[2014-01-23 14:52:44] lukeis: :)
[2014-01-23 14:53:05] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: My experience with mercurial is limited to Firebreath, but I recall there being some oddity with tracking multiple branches.
[2014-01-23 14:53:34] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we have multiple branches as part of the firefox release process
[2014-01-23 14:53:51] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Although from what I gather, mercurial works substantially better on Windows.  If improving contributions matters, that should be at least considered.
[2014-01-23 14:53:51] Oscar, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-23 14:53:56] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: hg has come on leaps and bounds in the last year
[2014-01-23 14:54:06] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: ++
