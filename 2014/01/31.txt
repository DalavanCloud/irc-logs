[2014-01-31 08:16:34] dogarrhea: i used to live there. 15 blocks north of Oracle headquarters on ralston ave in belmont
[2014-01-31 08:17:09] cgoldberg: i'm going to Oakland in a few weeks.  but flying into SF.  is that a bad train commute from SF airport into Oakland?
[2014-01-31 08:17:17] cgoldberg: lukeis, ^^
[2014-01-31 08:17:30] jimevans: cgoldberg: that's not so bad.

[2014-01-31 08:18:01] cgoldberg: cool.. seems Oakland doesn't have a big airport eh?
[2014-01-31 08:18:09] lukeis: it's 2 terminals
[2014-01-31 08:18:15] lukeis: i fly out of it

[2014-01-31 08:18:44] lukeis: (no direct flights to boston though, i don't think)
[2014-01-31 08:19:57] cgoldberg: lukeis, no direct flights from Boston... I'm all set with layovers and changing planes :P  can fly direct to SF
[2014-01-31 08:20:24] jimevans: i usually fly into SFO myself, but then i stay in the financial district too
[2014-01-31 08:20:41] cgoldberg: jimevans, lukeis...  Marriot at 1001 Broadway .. supposedly 400ft. from a BART stop

[2014-01-31 09:34:20] jimevans: somebody had the freakin brilliant idea of (on 64-bit windows) making the manager process (owning the top-level window) a 64-bit process, while making the content process (owning the browser tab windows) 32-bit processes.
[2014-01-31 09:34:22] lukeis: jleyba: are you guys running tests against IE11?
[2014-01-31 09:34:54] jleyba: lukeis: Primarily javascript based tests (where WebDriver is used to start the browser and load some URL)
[2014-01-31 09:35:41] jimevans: this mismatch is the root cause of two major problems in the IE driver for IE10+: screenshots, and slow typing using the 64-bit driver.
[2014-01-31 09:37:44] jimevans: nirvdrum: if you're around, this is the cause of the screenshot misery on IE10.
[2014-01-31 09:38:17] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, that would explain all the 32-bit / 64-bit weirdness I was seeing.
[2014-01-31 09:38:41] nirvdrum: jimevans: If you recall, I was asking why the 32-bit IEDriverServer was spawning 64-bit IE way back when.
[2014-01-31 09:39:02] jimevans: yep. the window hook for the resize message is never getting set when you run the 32-bit IE driver, because the process is a 64-bit process.

[2014-01-31 09:39:38] jimevans: the process owning the window whose message loop we're hooking is a 64-bit process, rather.
[2014-01-31 09:40:22] jimevans: similarly, the slow typing when running the 64-bit IE driver is due to attempting to set a windows hook on a 32-bit process from a 64-bit process, which of course, won't work.

[2014-01-31 09:40:52] jimevans: the word i'm looking for here, is "fuck"
[2014-01-31 09:41:40] jleyba: that's a good word
[2014-01-31 09:41:52] jleyba: nice and cathartic
[2014-01-31 09:42:00] nirvdrum: Not that this would be awesome, but since for the hooks you provide the address for the DLL, could you have the server process switch between the two?
[2014-01-31 09:42:19] awilson820, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-31 09:42:24] jimevans: nope. because you can't execute code cross-bitness.
[2014-01-31 09:42:25] nirvdrum: Although you wouldn't be able to load the library, so you'd have to spawn another process I guess.
[2014-01-31 09:42:32] jimevans: exactly.
[2014-01-31 09:43:13] nirvdrum: But that other process would just be a shell to load the library.
[2014-01-31 09:43:16] jimevans: just take an effing power drill to my temple. it'd be less painful in the long run, and i might eventually come to *enjoy* than.
[2014-01-31 09:43:18] jimevans: taht
[2014-01-31 09:43:25] nirvdrum: So, have both IEDriverServers installed and have them call out to each other :-P
[2014-01-31 09:44:13] jimevans: that might be the only way to handle this.
[2014-01-31 09:44:45] jimevans: of course how to make the damned thing friendly to users is another matter altogether.
[2014-01-31 09:45:20] jimevans: it was hard enough to get people to know they had to download a single extra binary, much less having to get two of them.
[2014-01-31 09:45:22] jimevans: sigh
[2014-01-31 09:45:45] jleyba: jimevans: Distribute a msi or other installer?
[2014-01-31 09:45:56] jleyba: or a zip even
[2014-01-31 09:46:13] jimevans: jleyba: if i was gonna do that, i'd create the effing thing as a browser plugin and be done with it.
[2014-01-31 09:46:34] jimevans: but you're right, that might be the best approach.
[2014-01-31 09:47:05] jimevans: i'm going to have to think on it for awhile.
[2014-01-31 09:47:07] jleyba: you can run an installer without admin privileges though, can't you?  and a plugin would require admin
[2014-01-31 09:47:37] jimevans: jleyba: not if you install to the program files directory, but your point is well taken

[2014-01-31 09:48:45] jimevans: i'm going to really try to think this through.
[2014-01-31 09:50:11] nirvdrum: jimevans: The other shitty thing you could do is have a wrapper process that writes the real bins to the directory.
[2014-01-31 09:50:26] nirvdrum: Although you might be better off just zipping at that point and calling it a day.
[2014-01-31 09:50:28] jimevans: i'd think about distributing executables embedded as resources if i didn't care about setting off false positives in virtually every antivirus scanner on the process.
[2014-01-31 09:50:34] jimevans: s/process/planet/
[2014-01-31 09:50:52] jleyba: for the record, if a browser plugin would simplify the IEDriver and improve its functionality, I think we should do that, even if it makes things a little more difficult for users
[2014-01-31 09:51:32] jleyba: but I'm not the one writing the code, so my opinion doesn't really matter :-)

[2014-01-31 10:29:10] Hello71: not knowing anything about the CI you're using, maybe it doesn't have browser installed?
[2014-01-31 10:29:14] Hello71: or GUI?

[2014-01-31 10:30:51] ato: lukeis: Is that because we're missing a SauceDriver class?
[2014-01-31 10:32:18] jleyba: we should just write a small webdriver server that forwards everything to sauce
[2014-01-31 10:32:23] jleyba: and point our tests at that
[2014-01-31 10:32:35] jleyba: so we don't have to worry about keeping each language in sync
[2014-01-31 10:32:37] ato: +1
[2014-01-31 10:32:56] ato: Also the SauceDriver implementation is a bit icky because it needs to be special cased in certain cases.
[2014-01-31 10:33:04] ato: At least last time I looked at it, which is a while ago admittedly.
