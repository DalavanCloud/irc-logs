[2014-01-06 08:39:07] dimacus: ahhhh so basically JS style, pass pass pass all the way to the click
[2014-01-06 08:39:17] dimacus: no that seems really complicated
[2014-01-06 08:39:18] smccarthy: Dude-X: thats that way my page objects are. They pass back other page objects
[2014-01-06 08:39:44] dimacus: smccarthy: what's the advantage of doing that instead of having simpler methods?
[2014-01-06 08:39:50] Dude-X: smccarthy: how does debugging work out for you?
[2014-01-06 08:40:11] smccarthy: I like it because I think its easier to follow along in the test.
[2014-01-06 08:40:28] smccarthy: So people just don't call methods from any page object, they know exactly what page they are on
[2014-01-06 08:41:19] dimacus: i'm trying to wrap my head around this
[2014-01-06 08:41:40] dimacus: basically i'm on registration page, i have the Registration Page Object, which knows how to register
[2014-01-06 08:41:49] dimacus: ie, which fields to fill out what button to click
[2014-01-06 08:41:53] dimacus: does that sound right?

[2014-01-06 08:44:04] bimmelino: you hardly find written books for this topic
[2014-01-06 08:44:08] Dave_B_: smccarthy: the problem i found with returning page objects was i had to build in duplication of application logic e.g. if i click login i need to understand if the right fields were filled in, if the password was correct etc
[2014-01-06 08:44:45] smccarthy: dimacus: yea. I like to have a method for each field on the page, and than helper methods which do multiple of the single methods. Like for a login page, I have a enterUsername, enterPassword, clickLoginWithValidCredentials, clickLoginWithInvalidCredentials, signInWithValidCredentials, and signInWithInvalidCredentials methods. clickLoginWithValidCredentials and signInWithValidCredentials will both return the HomePage page object
[2014-01-06 08:45:09] dimacus: bimmelino:  yeah me too so it sounded like a good idea… i mean all other parts of dev world have good books
[2014-01-06 08:45:25] dimacus: smccarthy: interesting this is similar to what i've been doing
[2014-01-06 08:45:41] dimacus: but without the return of the page object, ie the test would do this
[2014-01-06 08:45:49] dimacus: new HomePage
[2014-01-06 08:46:05] smccarthy: and you pass the driver to that HomePage object in the test?
[2014-01-06 08:46:07] dimacus: HomePage.register, HomePage.login, etc..
[2014-01-06 08:46:30] Dude-X, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-06 08:46:34] dimacus: driver is global… at least reference to it
[2014-01-06 08:46:45] smccarthy: oh ok
[2014-01-06 08:46:49] dimacus: not the best practice from incapsulation
[2014-01-06 08:46:53] dimacus: but i was young and stupid
[2014-01-06 08:47:13] Dave_B_: all my pages are init'd with driver and do a basic sanity check via title to try t catch wrong page before interacting with it
[2014-01-06 08:47:30] dimacus: yeah i like that
[2014-01-06 08:47:50] dimacus: basically in my case, when you call new page, it self validates against the html
[2014-01-06 08:48:14] smccarthy: Dave_B_: I wait for an element on the page in the constructor of my page object, but that it. So when I try and interact with the page, if it is on the wrong page it will fail since the element won't be there.
[2014-01-06 08:48:30] smccarthy: Dave_B_: How do you wait for the title to be there?
[2014-01-06 08:49:02] bimmelino: yeah, i do a general page assertion first. a fail message "dashboard view not loaded" is a smarter fail message than "could not click button "xyz"" which would have been the first action on dashboard view.
[2014-01-06 08:49:06] smccarthy: Incase you click on a link and it takes you to a new page, how do you know if you check the title if you are still on the old page, or on the new page ?
[2014-01-06 08:49:46] smccarthy: bimmelino: I like that idea. I might do that instead (assert that the element is there, and can fail with a nicer message)
[2014-01-06 08:49:57] Dave_B_: smccarthy: explicit wait for title to be as expected. Not sure it's the right way, it's just what I've done!

[2014-01-06 15:31:31] jleyba: so if you wrap it in an anonymous function, you just create a no-op
[2014-01-06 15:32:25] jimevans: something got screwy with the language binding frames tests when i tried to use it as-is. i'm not remembering what the reason was.
[2014-01-06 15:33:51] jimevans: something in the way findElement wouldn't work properly. i'll have to change it back and retry it to remember what it is.
[2014-01-06 15:34:33] jimevans: but revert it back if you think it's a bad change. i'll research it more tomorrow when i can. i'm late as it is right now.
