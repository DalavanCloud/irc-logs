[2014-01-22 03:18:55] p00j4: need help in distributing tests among different browsers on the same machine
[2014-01-22 03:21:26] p00j4: explored selenium gridm, testng and figured out to run tests in parallel, but how can I distribute the tests along with running in parallel (1st 10 in 1 browser, next 10 in another browser and so on..))
[2014-01-22 03:21:42] p00j4: *selenium grid
[2014-01-22 03:22:30] Dave_B_: by different browsers do you mean e.g. one in chrome, one in firefox, or different windows of chrome and firefox, or...?
[2014-01-22 03:27:06] Dave_B_: (so if you're testing cross-browser behaviour you may run the same test in each, when trying to execute lots in parallel you may use lots of instances of one browser type - I'm a bit unclear on what you mean)

[2014-01-22 03:46:19] Dave_B_: if you've got a grid anyway it'll handle parallel tests fine, so you jsut need a way of triggering your tests in parallel

[2014-01-22 03:46:39] Dave_B_: and that needs to be thread-safe
[2014-01-22 03:46:51] p00j4: via TestNg+grid or using dataprovider+TestNg, can suceefully run tests in parallel, but can't distribute them.
[2014-01-22 03:47:50] p00j4: the aim is to reduce execution time as having 40 tests so wanna distribute batch of 10 on each browser instance
[2014-01-22 03:48:03] Dave_B_: i don't really know anything about testng but so long as each test creates it's own webdriver instance on the grid you should be fine
[2014-01-22 03:48:28] JasmeetQA1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-01-22 03:49:06] Dave_B_: i'd probably not look to say '10 here, 10 there' but rather just cap your degree of parallelisation at 4 threads and let the tests fall where they will (or higher of course)
[2014-01-22 03:50:04] p00j4: so when u say 4 threads, does it mean each theard will be running different tests!
[2014-01-22 03:50:55] Dave_B_: yep
[2014-01-22 03:51:39] Dave_B_: so i use (python) nosetests and run a number of threads up to the max number of browser instances I can get (in my case 10)
[2014-01-22 03:52:07] Dave_B_: my test runner handles distributing the tests amongst these for me
[2014-01-22 03:53:00] p00j4: ok, then where shall I configure this thread count?   (i'm using java+webdriver+maven+testng n have configured on Jenkins 2 run dedicately on remote machine)
[2014-01-22 03:54:06] Dave_B_: http://blog.wedoqa.com/2013/07/how-to-run-parallel-tests-with-selenium-webdriver-and-testng-2/
[2014-01-22 03:54:21] Dave_B_: this appears to suggest that testng will take a parametet 'thread-count'
[2014-01-22 03:55:01] Dave_B_: in the testng.xml file
[2014-01-22 03:55:15] Dave_B_: '<suite name="Parallel test runs" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">'
[2014-01-22 03:56:04] p00j4: yes, I have done similar
[2014-01-22 03:56:15] p00j4: but it doenst run diffenert tests

[2014-01-22 03:57:57] p00j4: sorry if it was misleading
[2014-01-22 03:58:28] p00j4: I want to run same tests for different test data (40 test data kept in excel sheet)
[2014-01-22 03:58:41] p00j4: for each row, whole test cylce goes
[2014-01-22 03:59:10] Dave_B_: oh, right
[2014-01-22 03:59:11] Dave_B_: hrm
[2014-01-22 03:59:13] p00j4: so for 1st 10 test data, 1 browser instance and for 2nd test data-2nd browser instance and so on
[2014-01-22 03:59:54] Dave_B_: i'm not sure what the best way of doing that would be, sorry :(

[2014-01-22 04:46:13] andy_seit: I was having a think about this on my break.  I think how I'd do it would be, assuming 3 nodes and 30 pieces of data, have 3 parallel jenkins jobs, have a powershell script that fires for each job which takes the appropriate 10 pieces of test data, injects that into the appropriate agent .config, have the test fixture with a parallel count of 1, instead of trying to repeat one test 10 times per agent, I'd have
[2014-01-22 04:46:13] andy_seit:  10 tests in the test fixture, each hardcoded to pull testdata1, testdata2, etc from config.  That way you'd have the 3 parallel runs, with the appropriate data.
[2014-01-22 04:46:24] andy_seit: It's inelegant, but I think it would work.

[2014-01-22 06:47:17] dimacus: (i'm assuming it happens on 1 of 10 to 20 nodes that you have)
[2014-01-22 06:47:49] dimacus: and whenever test tries to connect to that 1 box it fails consistently, but since you have so many it rotates amongst them until it hits it again
[2014-01-22 06:48:50] dimacus: andy_seit: hope that helps
[2014-01-22 06:49:08] andy_seit: Sounds like a 'mare to debug, but that gives me something to go on :D   Cheers

[2014-01-22 06:50:20] dimacus: andy_seit:  yeah… in similar situation i have the test output the session info of the node you are connected to (ip, ff version, session id, etc..) into console, this way when it happens 3 or 4 times in the next week you can start to see some patterns
[2014-01-22 06:50:50] dimacus: it's not one of those things you can sit and debug by staring at it… more like add a some logging and let it happen several times before you get a pattern

[2014-01-22 08:21:01] p00j4: if not then here you go-
[2014-01-22 08:21:08] AutomatedTester: what IE issue
[2014-01-22 08:22:06] p00j4: nyone got selenium working with IE11 on Windows 8.1? When running a simple test (to check the page title) the browser opens but then the test fails with either a "NoSuchWindowError" or the title comes back as "WebDriver" instead of the actual page title.
[2014-01-22 08:22:28] p00j4: this one.
[2014-01-22 08:22:33] jimevans: p00j4: known issue. microsoft hosed us when they changed behavior in IE11.
[2014-01-22 08:22:42] jimevans: need a fix or workaround from them.
[2014-01-22 08:22:49] p00j4: but there is a solution
[2014-01-22 08:23:03] jimevans: no, there really isn't. adding the site to trusted sites isn't sufficient.
[2014-01-22 08:23:05] p00j4: its weired but its the trick which I beiliev should work for you
[2014-01-22 08:23:45] rebelagentm, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-01-22 08:24:00] p00j4: try: in IE settings: Internet Zone - Enable Protected Mode on Local Intranet - Enable Protected Mode off Local Intranet -
[2014-01-22 08:24:01] jimevans: the problem is rooted in the fact that you cross protected mode boundaries, even when you've specifically set the protected mode settings to prevent it.
[2014-01-22 08:24:32] p00j4:  click on sites - Automatically detect intranet network option is turned on(if its checked for you then uncheck it)
[2014-01-22 08:26:40] p00j4: jimevans: yes, so we need to have Internet Zone - Enable Protected Mode on Local Intranet - Enable Protected Mode-> off  and Automatically detect intranet network option on/off(for my case off worked)

[2014-01-22 08:28:12] jimevans: the problem is that the browser can cross protected mode boundaries without warning.
[2014-01-22 08:28:39] jimevans: MSFT knows the feature they added that causes this behavior; i've spoken with them about it.

[2014-01-22 10:29:17] dimacus: ato: how about sticking a webrtc server in the Gridhub, and letting all the nodes connect to it, this way anyone can peek inside of the windows build box as the build is going
[2014-01-22 10:29:27] dimacus: see? everywhere!!!!
[2014-01-22 10:30:14] ato: dimacus: Since I work for a browser vendor, it would be cool to instrument WebRTC with multiple browser instances for testing purposes, though.
[2014-01-22 10:30:43] dimacus: jleyba: yeah i'm good with nagouts, i just have to step out in 15 mins for an appoitment but will be back in an hour, is that cool?
[2014-01-22 10:31:29] dimacus: ato: way ahead of you… there is a Chrome extension that lets you stream individual tabs… this would allow you to run multiple tests on top of each other and still stream the build as it goes
[2014-01-22 10:32:09] dimacus: ato: final goal… build starts in jenkins, as you see the build going in console, a window can be inserted into jenkins ui to see the build as console is rolling by

It works on chrome & firefox, but on IE (while it works manually) instead of activating the debug bar it causes the window to jump monitors.  :/

[2014-01-22 11:12:47] stephend: retornam: would you know?
[2014-01-22 11:12:54] nirvdrum: There's probably more than one issue.  I was just dealing with a logger one.

[2014-01-22 11:14:17] nirvdrum: retornam: A binary heap dump I can load up in yourkit, visualvm, or eclipse mat.  hprof binary format is probably the most compatible.
[2014-01-22 11:14:42] stephend: do we need it from the nodes, or just from the Hub machine?
[2014-01-22 11:14:51] nirvdrum: stephend: Whichever one you think is leaking.
[2014-01-22 11:15:05] nirvdrum: jmap can take the dump.  I don't recall all the flags.
[2014-01-22 11:15:26] barancev|2: visualvm is really simple in use
[2014-01-22 11:15:43] retornam: nirvdrum: mainly the hub. never used visualvm

Could someone point me in the right direction?
[2014-01-22 11:15:47] barancev|2: and it is a part of the regular oracle java sdk
[2014-01-22 11:16:56] nirvdrum: retornam: It's pretty nice and it's free.  I prefer YourKit, but that can get pricey if you don't get an open source license.

[2014-01-22 13:03:59] nirvdrum: But, GitHub is the 800 lbs. gorilla. *shrug*
[2014-01-22 13:05:06] nirvdrum: My biggest issue with GitHub, outside of the issue tracker, and the fact they kill off useful features, is they decided they were really going to get in your face about questionable recommendations.  So they do shit like truncate commit messages in the Web UI and screw with the text in pull requests.
[2014-01-22 13:05:34] nirvdrum: But they don't even do it properly.  Oftentimes they'll truncate my PR message and actually make it longer with the extra shit they throw in.

[2014-01-22 13:10:29] nirvdrum: I mean if you got the 500, it's hard to argue that gcode is a fine product.
[2014-01-22 13:10:51] nirvdrum: lukeis: I'll probably end up changing to GitHub.  It's not ideal, but it's the least bad leading option.
[2014-01-22 13:10:54] jarib: makes you think twice, for sure

[2014-01-22 13:22:22] jleyba: AutomatedTester: just legacy behavior
[2014-01-22 13:22:27] jleyba: IMHO that shouldn't be a supported operation
[2014-01-22 13:22:42] jarib: i agree
[2014-01-22 13:22:47] jleyba: should be switchToFrame(index) or switchToFrame(webElement)

Instead, it always returns the first window having the given name. To ensure that all windows are accessible, make sure that no two windows in a document have the same name.
