[2014-01-13 12:13:31] jimevans: but css or xpath for a specific tag name is ridiculously easy.
[2014-01-13 12:13:33] patarr: Yeah it seems like I need xpath
[2014-01-13 12:13:48] jimevans: not the name attribute. the name of the tag. 'ul' in your case
[2014-01-13 12:13:58] patarr: jimevans, only the father element is specific. Then I will need to traverse down from there to find the elements.

[2014-01-13 12:14:45] jimevans: (which is separate from By.name(), which finds by the name attribute)

[2014-01-13 12:18:47] jimevans: patarr: then find the parent element, and use element.findElements().
[2014-01-13 12:18:54] jimevans: which limits the scope to the parent element.
[2014-01-13 12:19:01] patarr: jimevans: that's awesome. Thank you!

[2014-01-13 12:25:25] klyed2: POST /wd/hub/session/url
[2014-01-13 12:26:26] jimevans: klyed2: there's no session id parameter.

[2014-01-13 12:27:01] jimevans: you need /wd/hub/session/:sessionId/url.
[2014-01-13 12:27:21] klyed2: ah thanks
[2014-01-13 12:27:34] lukeis: i would suggest going with another binding if you're already tripping up on the first thing you do with webdriver
[2014-01-13 12:28:00] barancev: and with another language :)
[2014-01-13 12:28:08] klyed2: everything used to work

[2014-01-13 13:19:05] klyed2: and per the documentation on the recomonded bindings, " This hopes to eliminate the latter step, and invites you to rely almost exclusively on the Selenium JSON Wire Protocol." So please don't hackle me next time about relying on the json protocol.
[2014-01-13 13:19:14] klyed2: again, thanks for the help getting things to work
[2014-01-13 13:19:57] jimevans: heh. adam didn't change the readme when he forked.
[2014-01-13 13:21:26] jimevans: his api looks nothing like the original facebook api did when he forked from them.
[2014-01-13 13:21:40] jimevans: so, yes, i believe i *will* heckle you about using the wire protocol directly.

[2014-01-13 13:36:25] AutomatedTester: 3.2 is ~10% of Google's value
[2014-01-13 13:36:26] nirvdrum: Everyone that can afford a Nest or wants to buy one owns one by now.
[2014-01-13 13:36:48] nirvdrum: It's basically the apex of opulence.
[2014-01-13 13:37:02] davidlai: I can't wait to see the Nest google+ integration.  Californians can brag about how much energy they are saving on heating bills.
[2014-01-13 13:37:13] nirvdrum: About the only value I've seen in Nest is it serves as a great way to weed out people that have no fucking clue what it means to be middle class.
[2014-01-13 13:37:23] AutomatedTester: davidlai: but no one will see it since its G+
[2014-01-13 13:38:47] phasze: Nest seems like a lazy way to program a thermostat

[2014-01-13 13:45:51] Dude-X: i think the one i have doesn't work at all
[2014-01-13 13:46:06] nirvdrum: I guess it's something to do while sitting on the toilet with your phone.
[2014-01-13 13:47:01] Dude-X: well my wife suffers from hypothyroid and has a bad habit of leaving the stove on
[2014-01-13 13:47:25] Dude-X: so  the network aspect lets me phone home and check the carbon monoxide detector

[2014-01-13 13:49:23] Dude-X: i complained to the property manager, why is the building making a beeping noise
[2014-01-13 13:49:24] nirvdrum: Prometheian: Chrome auto-updates itself.  You'd have to jump through some hoops to prevent that.  Then just use the path to that version.

[2014-01-13 13:49:57] Dude-X: she tells me she has no idea what i'm talking about. so i decided to track the source of the beep and found it was my next door neighbor.
[2014-01-13 13:50:25] nirvdrum: See.  If she had a nest, your whole building would just be burnt down.
[2014-01-13 13:50:36] Prometheian: Nirv: I can't call, like, ChromeDriver(v32); or something?
[2014-01-13 13:50:49] nirvdrum: Nope.
[2014-01-13 13:52:03] davidlai: I guess you can pass it a executable path.

[2014-01-13 13:52:57] davidlai: there's a 'executable_path' param in the constructor from what I see in the source.  But I've never used it.  Do most of my specific version testing over selenium grid using remote webdriver /w capabilities obj.
[2014-01-13 13:56:46] Prometheian: I'm kinda limited w/ what I'm doing here. A previous employee built a script that hits our client sites in several places to cache pages and speed them up for anyone else using the pages. This was built in JUnit, and if I say so, quite confusingly. It's got a bunch of classes that all interlink and make following it complete ass. I built a new warmup script for a small part of a client site...
[2014-01-13 13:56:47] Prometheian: ...w/ intent that it's scalable, however now my boss wants me to either implement my warmup into this crap, or pull out what it's doing and throw it into my code.

[2014-01-13 15:11:42] patarr: Ah.
[2014-01-13 15:11:50] dimacus: i have to do a ton of deploys for my compnay
[2014-01-13 15:11:51] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-13 15:12:11] dimacus: any time we start a prod deploy, you set the CDN cache duration to a minimum so it's 0 cache
[2014-01-13 15:12:22] dimacus: and then as deploy finishes bump it up to 30 seconds or w/e
[2014-01-13 15:12:29] patarr: But putting a cache proxy right in front of your company's app doesn't really do much right? BEcause you usually already have caching as part of the app stack, and loadbalancers handle static resources from http servers that cache, etc etc?
[2014-01-13 15:12:38] dimacus: lukeis:  just never set up a proxy/cache servic on my own yet
[2014-01-13 15:13:01] dimacus: patarr: sure… but if you put it in front of assets
[2014-01-13 15:13:09] dimacus: say static CSS or JS, or images
[2014-01-13 15:13:12] lukeis: i haven't done it in a testing environment… only production (in a previous life) ;)
[2014-01-13 15:13:14] patarr: Seems like it only becomes useful once you start setting it up on CDNs distributed worldwide to cut latency..
[2014-01-13 15:13:23] dimacus: all of the sudden you can reduce load time by 3 or 4x
[2014-01-13 15:13:40] patarr: dimacus, but that stuff is usually handled by nginx no?
[2014-01-13 15:13:42] dimacus: lukeis: that life shall not be spoken off again
[2014-01-13 15:14:10] dimacus: patarr: not really… not for us at least… it really depends on the stack i guess
[2014-01-13 15:14:41] dimacus: we have DB caching, we got App Model caching, we got load balancer (haproxy) for couple K of machines
[2014-01-13 15:14:45] AutomatedTester: zomg... touch user actions appears to be done for the spec
[2014-01-13 15:14:45] lukeis: dimacus: well, i did learn how to program an F5 load balancer because of that previous life :)
[2014-01-13 15:14:51] dimacus: and we use CDN to cache everything static
[2014-01-13 15:15:03] *AutomatedTester walks off for a quick celebratory whiskey'
[2014-01-13 15:15:06] patarr: dimacus, what do you use for db caching? DB's like MySQL already have cache don't they?
[2014-01-13 15:15:12] lukeis: AutomatedTester: where's an implementation!? :)
[2014-01-13 15:15:12] nirvdrum: dimacus: Only cache the stuff that makes sense.  Images and such.

[2014-01-13 15:15:48] dimacus: patarr: we do use mysql, but again we are in rails stack so i think ActiveRecord does caching for you

[2014-01-13 15:19:27] barancev: nirvdrum: do you know the 3.0 plan for the selenium server? are we going to remove RC support?
[2014-01-13 15:19:39] dimacus: and they are in secure spot but they need to talk to boxes in network, staging, uat, etc..

[2014-01-13 15:20:07] dimacus: so if 12 boxes are using same tunnel to run 12 tests at a minimum against staging (beefy box) than the connection will go down
[2014-01-13 15:20:14] nirvdrum: barancev: The plan is to move RC out of core.  But it will be separate artifact.
[2014-01-13 15:22:02] barancev: so server will continue to be dual-protocol?

[2014-01-13 15:31:57] jleyba: is my understanding at least

[2014-01-13 15:33:04] jleyba: netty please?
[2014-01-13 15:33:15] nirvdrum: The current one can move over with RC.

[2014-01-13 15:35:18] jleyba: Doesn't offer anything meaningful over just using netty
[2014-01-13 15:39:26] dimacus: nirvdrum: lukeis: Here is my game plan, can you guys poke some holes in it? http://i.imgur.com/WNwlnoW.jpg
[2014-01-13 15:40:23] dimacus: everything  is on a Gigabit datacenter and biffy boxes, so it should be relatively fast, close to 0 lag that ssh tunnel would do… and make the proxy server have a white list of boxes on each side that can be accessed
[2014-01-13 15:40:25] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I can see it, the "Internet of Things" age is upon us

[2014-01-13 15:44:10] dimacus: lukeis:  you know what is the saddest thing is? This is by far the simplest solution i came up with
[2014-01-13 15:44:24] qaguy, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-01-13 15:44:36] lukeis: not, "buy some OSX boxes and put them inside your intranet" ?
[2014-01-13 15:45:06] dimacus: someone was offerening to setup a reverse ssh tunnel on each of the OSX boxes that would map to a different port on grid box, and grid would have to keep track of pc1 -> localhost:8888 etc..
[2014-01-13 15:45:43] dimacus: lukeis: sys admins are extremely adamant about adding OSX boxes to the data center
[2014-01-13 15:45:56] lukeis: about not* ?
[2014-01-13 15:45:57] dimacus: it's Centos or nothing… lost that fight 8 months ago
[2014-01-13 15:46:24] AutomatedTester: dimacus: tell the product managers you arent supporting OSX unless it can live in the data centre
[2014-01-13 15:46:26] dimacus: lukeis:  they were not even friendly on putting OSX as a vm on the data center
[2014-01-13 15:46:27] AutomatedTester: and walk away
[2014-01-13 15:47:09] dimacus: hahahaha… sadly sys admins have more pull than i do, and lot more managerial ears… VP type of pull
[2014-01-13 15:47:20] dimacus: i'm just a nobody who has to figure out the mine traps
[2014-01-13 15:47:55] AutomatedTester: dimacus: as I say, tell the product managers you can't support OSX since its not in the data centre and the sysops won't put it in there
[2014-01-13 15:47:56] barancev: ok, whatever server it will be, selenium server 3.0 is going to talk webdriver protocol only
[2014-01-13 15:48:03] AutomatedTester: end of converstation
[2014-01-13 15:48:24] AutomatedTester: if product managers care they will have the necessary swing
[2014-01-13 15:48:32] AutomatedTester: or you get off not having to support osx
[2014-01-13 15:48:52] dimacus: AutomatedTester: fair enough… i wanna try this just for the sheer fact it's complicated and that i say i did it
[2014-01-13 15:49:12] dimacus: i'm more interested in solving the problem than delivering working software :-P

[2014-01-13 15:50:21] dimacus: i have a problem, i'd like to try this solution, and i'm free for 3 months to get it done
[2014-01-13 15:50:31] barancev: AutomatedTester: please finish marionette first :)
[2014-01-13 15:50:37] dimacus: as long as you keep delivering what you promised managment is happy

[2014-01-13 15:51:11] lukeis: sounds like AutomatedTester could go to work at groupon and make his project be "implement Marionette as new Firefox Driver in our grid" ;)
[2014-01-13 15:51:33] dimacus: i think that would work… my manager would hire you today ;)
