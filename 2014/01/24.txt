[2014-01-24 02:24:23] andy_seit: Does anyone know if the iedriver currently support actions for keystroke sending (dotnet/windows)?  I need to do a ctrl+f10 to fire the google debug bar, and it seems to work fine in Ffox & Chrome but doesn't seem to do anything in IE.  I've tried the usual action.build.perform, tried element.SendKeys(Keys.Ctrl, Keys.F10), but no joy.  Am I just messing up somehow or cant the iedriver support this atm?
[2014-01-24 02:24:32] andy_seit: Figured I'd ask before I try to hack my way around it.
[2014-01-24 02:27:38] andy_seit: Alternatively, if anyone knows a more intelligent way to test google DFP that works too. ;)

[2014-01-24 04:51:51] eagles0513875_: i do know i need to rework this code for sure as it was written by someone else and its a big mess. :)
[2014-01-24 04:52:49] Dave_B_: 2.27 means you can go up to ff24
[2014-01-24 04:52:58] Dave_B_: erm
[2014-01-24 04:53:00] Dave_B_: 2.37
[2014-01-24 04:53:14] Dave_B_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/CHANGELOG
[2014-01-24 04:54:05] eagles0513875_: Dave_B_: ok
[2014-01-24 04:55:37] Dave_B_: i quite often have to rewrite code that is a big mess, unfortunately sometimes it was me that wrote it :(
[2014-01-24 04:57:45] eagles0513875_: Dave_B_: this isnt the case
[2014-01-24 04:58:00] eagles0513875_: i already have a workign prototype which has the selenium server integrated into the running of the application
[2014-01-24 04:58:08] eagles0513875_: but havent had a chance to continue it

[2014-01-24 05:00:17] PavanGupta01, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-24 05:01:04] Dave_B_: using operadriver?
[2014-01-24 05:02:01] eagles0513875_: Dave_B_: right now to start the selenium server we have to run a seperate script
[2014-01-24 05:03:03] eagles0513875_: this is before we run the jar file
[2014-01-24 05:03:06] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-24 05:03:24] Dave_B_: i don't run the jar files at all
[2014-01-24 05:03:42] eagles0513875_: Dave_B_: we do though
[2014-01-24 05:04:04] Dave_B_: :) I guessed, was jsut wondering why
[2014-01-24 05:04:05] eagles0513875_: basically integration of the server we can just run it it starts the server and we go right into the tests
[2014-01-24 05:05:04] Dave_B_: most of the language packages have everything they need to go right into the tests without ever starting a server jar
[2014-01-24 05:05:33] Dave_B_: I've used the jar in the past as I just ran everything as remote web driver, even when it wasn't remote
[2014-01-24 05:05:44] Dave_B_: not sure if I should or shouldn't
[2014-01-24 05:05:51] Dave_B_: *shrug*
[2014-01-24 05:06:02] *Dave_B_ is still trying to decide how best to do stuff, hence the questioning'
[2014-01-24 05:07:58] eagles0513875_: server integration into the jar file is the easiest i think

[2014-01-24 08:36:50] patarr: Whenever I spawn a browser instance/driver from selenium, i notice that it acts a little differently than a regular browser. Is this perhaps due to launching the browser in some sort of dev mode? On some particular pages, there is a resource that is trying to be loaded externally. It 404s, but the browser just sits there and waits for a long time showing the loading circle indicator in the browser tab (chrome) and just keeps going and going
[2014-01-24 08:36:57] patarr: On a regular browser instance, this does not happen.

[2014-01-24 09:25:34] andy_seit: Hrm. Still can't get it to work with ctrlF10.KeyDown(Keys.Control).SendKeys(Keys.F10).Build().Perform(); .  You can see it respond to F10, as it displays the main menu but it doesn't look like the modifier's applied.  The same thing happened when I tried doing it with keybd_event, so I'm assuming its either something in my environment or something with the browser itself.  Either that or IE handles the google debug bar differently.

[2014-01-24 11:18:10] jimevans: i am utterly and entirely indifferent where the project code is hosted, what vcs is used, and where the binary downloads are hosted, as long as it's *somewhere*.
[2014-01-24 11:19:10] ato: As I said earlier, I'm surprised this was so much of an issue.

[2014-01-24 11:22:58] cgoldberg: jimevans, i'm not part of the discussion... but just to throw more headache into your options... also consider Launchpad.  it does issue tracking/questions/mirror git repos/host binaries.. etc
[2014-01-24 11:22:58] cgoldberg: https://launchpad.net
[2014-01-24 11:23:55] cgoldberg: it's been around since 2004 and hosts many high profile open source projects
[2014-01-24 11:25:14] ato: Does it still use bzr only?
[2014-01-24 11:25:41] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-24 11:25:55] cgoldberg: ato, natively yes.. so if you want full code reviews and real vcs capabilities yes.  bit can mirror git repos if you wanted to stay using git somewhere else
[2014-01-24 11:26:12] ato: \-:
[2014-01-24 11:26:29] ato: So I generally think that all the hosting solutions have gotten it wrong somehow.
[2014-01-24 11:26:44] cgoldberg: ato , I'd suggest moving to bzr, but I'd get clobberred :)
[2014-01-24 11:26:53] ato: It's a terrible VCS.
[2014-01-24 11:27:01] cgoldberg: bzr rocks :P
[2014-01-24 11:27:04] ato: I used bzr before I went to git.  For many years.
[2014-01-24 11:27:08] cgoldberg: i really like it actually

[2014-01-24 11:27:19] ato: It's extremely slow and has a tendency to break your repos.
[2014-01-24 11:27:36] jimevans: holyâ€¦ what da?!? windows phone pass rate against webdriver test suite: 96.86%

[2014-01-24 11:28:12] ato: git isn't a speed monster either because it's limited to one core.
[2014-01-24 11:28:21] jimevans: i gotta get this thing through legal so i can make it public.
[2014-01-24 11:30:36] jimevans: of course, that *is* modulo things that aren't supported on my windows phone implementation (like file uploads and alerts) but still...

[2014-01-24 11:52:47] jleyba: i just don't think node's standard library is strong enough to be worth using on a large project
[2014-01-24 11:53:21] kallisti: I like that I come back to hs-webdriver after 3 months of inactivity, change like 3 lines of code to fix something / add a feature, compile it, and forget about it for another 3 months.
[2014-01-24 11:53:25] kallisti: easiest project maintenance ever.
[2014-01-24 11:54:11] kallisti: occasionally a dependency changes its API or I need to bump dependency versions, etc.

[2014-01-24 12:13:34] kallisti: what are "injected atoms"?
[2014-01-24 12:13:41] davejlong: This is an iframe used for tracking that the user doesn't see.
[2014-01-24 12:14:13] lukeis: find by tagname "iframe" should do the trickâ€¦ but I don't think an iframe in the head is valid
[2014-01-24 12:14:28] lukeis: if they don't want the user to see it, they should style it to be hidden
[2014-01-24 12:14:35] davejlong: It is hidden.
[2014-01-24 12:14:38] jimevans: kallisti: a way to use the automation atoms entirely inside the browser. it's what safaridriver uses to drive safari.
[2014-01-24 12:14:50] davejlong: The iframe is inserted by JavaScript so it doesn't exist for up to a second after the page loads
[2014-01-24 12:15:19] lukeis: that's fine :) you'll need to poll your driver for the element to exist then

[2014-01-24 13:30:03] kallisti: t control the order of the commands at all, but you can do that with nesting callbacks
[2014-01-24 13:30:07] jleyba: lukeis: easy if you want to punish yourself and use rhino
[2014-01-24 13:30:35] jleyba: kallisti: webdriverjs tracks the order commands are registered so you don't have to use a bunch nesting
[2014-01-24 13:32:06] kallisti: I guess for webdriver that would make sense, since you usually have a definite order of commands.
[2014-01-24 13:32:49] kallisti: there could be situations where you don't care in what order 2 sequences of commands are executed in relation to each other, but I can't think of a specific example.

[2014-01-24 13:33:51] kallisti: I remember I did use some kind of async library once. I can't remember the name now though. I think it's just called "async"?

[2014-01-24 13:40:16] jleyba: and that's why i built a scheduler for webdriverjs
