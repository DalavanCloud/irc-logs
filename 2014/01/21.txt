[2014-01-21 06:24:00] llaskin: sort of
[2014-01-21 06:24:07] llaskin: whats REALLY happening is it seems to run getWebDriver twice
[2014-01-21 06:24:11] llaskin: and I can't figure out why thats happening

[2014-01-21 06:49:19] ato: simonstewart: So the spec's changed getCurrentWindowHandles to getWindowHandles.  Do we intentionally want to make that backwards incompatible change?
[2014-01-21 06:49:27] ato: I know there are certain things we need to break in Se 3.
[2014-01-21 06:49:55] simonstewart: Yes, we do want to make that change

[2014-01-21 06:50:13] simonstewart: The plan is for Se2 to handle both commands cleanly, then drop the old one when we bump to 3.0
[2014-01-21 06:50:15] ato: Okay so where do we want to keep the backwards compatibility, in the server or in the driver?

[2014-01-21 06:50:38] ato: I need to code something that works today.

[2014-01-21 06:51:00] simonstewart: Guess server side is the important bit
[2014-01-21 06:51:19] simonstewart: And we may want a way to determine which commands the remote end can understand
[2014-01-21 06:51:23] ato: Wonderful.  So Marionette previously had getWindows, so now we have two aliases for just that one command end-point )-:
[2014-01-21 06:51:36] simonstewart: *sigh*
[2014-01-21 06:51:53] simonstewart: You do have the advantage of controlling every marionette test
[2014-01-21 06:52:17] ato: We will likely be able to drop one “soon” when I get around to updating the JS Marionette client.
[2014-01-21 06:52:17] simonstewart: (well, almost all of them)
[2014-01-21 06:52:17] ato: Then one more when Se 3 is bumped (maybe).
[2014-01-21 06:52:34] ato: Yeah, sure.  We just need a migration strategy. (-:

[2014-01-21 07:01:14] simonstewart: It's not
[2014-01-21 07:02:32] simonstewart: The remote webdriver implementations implement the "FindBy*" interfaces which set things up manually.
[2014-01-21 07:02:50] simonstewart: Which is fine, so long as you're basically only calling "findElement"
[2014-01-21 07:03:12] simonstewart: But I'm working on allowing us to push expected conditions across the wire to the remote end
[2014-01-21 07:03:36] simonstewart: Which means serialising the condition, and that often means serialising a locator

[2014-01-21 07:13:16] qures: I am confused about the structure of selenium. How and what do I install to begin coding in Python? There are two projects: Selenium RC and selenium Webdriver. According to the docs, selenium webdriver is built ontop of selenium RC. That is to say, selenium 1.0 + webdriver = selenium 2.0. But selenium webdriver 'drives' web browsers completely different than RC which uses injected javascript. So what is the deal here?

[2014-01-21 07:14:29] dimacus: qures: ok so Webdriver is newer and Selenium RC is older
[2014-01-21 07:14:54] qures: Check
[2014-01-21 07:15:13] dimacus: RC worked in Javascript, and would do all the clicking and navigating in Javascript only… the issue with that was that JS is highly restricted, so that no website hacks your computer when you visit it
[2014-01-21 07:15:46] dimacus: These limitations were making a browser do certain things, dealing with cookies, or navigating to 2 websites with different URL
[2014-01-21 07:15:47] davehunt, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-01-21 07:16:24] dimacus: Answer is Webdriver, which has backwards computability to RC (in case you have 3,000 tests written in old, but want to slowly migrate to Webdriver)
[2014-01-21 07:17:00] dimacus: so, yes RC is supported in webdriver but not for long, the whole combo together is called Selenium
[2014-01-21 07:17:09] dimacus: qures: with me so far?
[2014-01-21 07:17:21] qures: Okay, so selenium 2.0 is just webdriver but 1.0 was thrown in for backward compatibility
[2014-01-21 07:17:37] dimacus: yup, and 3.0 probably will not have support for 1.0
[2014-01-21 07:18:01] qures: That makes a lot more sense. One moment while I...

[2014-01-21 07:19:36] ato: qures: You want to be using WebDriver.  In Python you'd start with the selenium package from PyPI.
[2014-01-21 07:20:16] qures: Well actually, I'm not going to make assumptions. Where do I download webdriver? There are a few places under selenium downloads and to the right under latest releases. In particular, under selenium downloads page there is a heading C# NuGet.
[2014-01-21 07:20:52] dimacus: qures:  ok what makes 2.0 Webdriver (wd from now on) more powerful is that it makes system api calls directly to the browser, without any JS, which gives it a lot more power. For example, in WD a click on a link or a button as a "native event" that is how the browser would normally respond when you move mouse and click VS js click in RC which was a fake emulation and could do weird behavior. So that's a brief structure of RC vs WD.
[2014-01-21 07:20:56] ato: For Python you'd normally fetch Selenium through your package manager.  pip or easy_install.
[2014-01-21 07:22:30] qures: Yeah, I read that in the docs as well. Which was the disconnect when I read that webdriver used RC for some reason. In retrospec, obvious. Package manager I have never used...

[2014-01-21 08:32:10] dimacus: simonstewart: if i had some time to spare to improve some of the CI related stuff, what would be the current biggest pain points to attack and what direction would be good to take in your opinion? Personally, I'd love to remove pre-compiled binaries of IEDriver from source, and add a windows box which would compile and test source as part of the build flow. Is it worth attacking that problem?
[2014-01-21 08:33:34] simonstewart: dimacus: danielwh is the best chap to talk to
[2014-01-21 08:34:26] simonstewart: I'm not sure if we want to remove the precompiled libraries --- right now any team member can build (say) the firefox driver locally without needing either gcc, the required SDKs or Visual Studio.
[2014-01-21 08:36:20] dimacus: simonstewart: having iedriver binaries in VCS gives me chills to the bone, i guess what i was thinking is that each commit gets a build, and the binaries for the given sha are exposed as a Jenkins build artifact. So anyone can download any version of the binary at any time, without need of GCC or Visual Studio
[2014-01-21 08:36:51] simonstewart: IEDriverServer might be excusable to remove.

[2014-01-21 08:40:45] dimacus: yeah, well i'm not very good at programing, but my speciality is improving code flows from dev head to prod, so i'll see what i can do
[2014-01-21 08:41:18] dimacus: my next trick will be to find someone who is willing to donate a couple of Visual Studio license to the project so there can be a windows dedicated node
[2014-01-21 08:42:13] dimacus: :note danielwh ping me when you get in, I wish to talk about IEDriver CI build
[2014-01-21 08:42:13] selbot2_____: ok!
[2014-01-21 08:42:14] jimevans: dimacus: be careful here. you *must* have visual studio 2010 at the moment.
[2014-01-21 08:42:40] dimacus: jimevans: good to know, 2013 not a go?
[2014-01-21 08:42:45] jimevans: and we'll need to coordinate when we want to update to a later version.
[2014-01-21 08:42:57] jimevans: right now, visual studio is used to build three things
[2014-01-21 08:43:13] Ragnaroek, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-21 08:43:15] jimevans: IEDriverServer, the .NET bindings, and the firefox native events components for windows
[2014-01-21 08:43:45] jimevans: the first requires visual studio because it requires the active template library (atl).
[2014-01-21 08:44:06] jimevans: the second doesn't really require visual studio at all, just the .net framework.
[2014-01-21 08:44:17] jimevans: the last one is problematic.
[2014-01-21 08:44:30] Ragnaroek: we are getting a lot of "StaleElementReferenceException" in our UI-Tests with Chrome (there is no such error with other Browsers like Firefox and IE)
[2014-01-21 08:44:47] Ragnaroek: any hints what can be causing that in Chrome?
[2014-01-21 08:44:52] jimevans: we use the gecko sdk to compile the native components, and they ship with static .obj files that are only linkable with VS2010
[2014-01-21 08:45:33] jimevans: oh. that's another piece that's challenging for removing all precompiled binaries from the source tree.
[2014-01-21 08:46:06] jimevans: both the java and .net bindings take both the windows and linux native events libraries and package them inside their containers.
[2014-01-21 08:46:48] jimevans: if you're only building on one platform (and you probably are), you need the precompiled binaries for the other platform to build a cross-platform compatible firefox driver.
[2014-01-21 08:46:58] ato: Is it possible to use MSBuild if we have VS2010 license?
[2014-01-21 08:47:02] dimacus: jimevans: sounds like a really big and fun mess to untangle :)
[2014-01-21 08:47:23] *ato didn't read the full backlog'
[2014-01-21 08:48:18] dimacus: ato: i will go with MSBuild if we were to add a box in CI for that, there is no reason to run full VS stack in jenkins
[2014-01-21 08:48:34] dimacus: (as in actively running IDE) MSBuild it all the way!!!

[2014-01-21 13:13:54] lukeis: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#moving-between-windows-and-frames
[2014-01-21 13:14:03] lukeis: could use some improvement… but still ;)

[2014-01-21 13:19:11] nullx: Hello, for C#, is there any way to force the PhantomJS bindings to use a linux binary instead of .exe?
[2014-01-21 13:19:34] nullx: It seems to be looking for phantomjs.exe... I came in here about this ages ago, just wondering if I'll have to compile the source for this
[2014-01-21 13:19:54] jimevans: nullx: yes, but i don't remember if the fix for that has been released in a compiled form or not. let me check.
[2014-01-21 13:20:16] nullx: please do thank you
[2014-01-21 13:21:20] nullx: In the source, "private const string PhantomJSDriverServiceFileName = "PhantomJS.exe";" heh

[2014-01-21 13:21:51] nullx: awesome
[2014-01-21 13:22:15] jimevans: hasn't seen a public release yet.
[2014-01-21 13:22:17] nullx: gotcha
[2014-01-21 13:22:26] HowardwLo: jimevans: not too great it seems
[2014-01-21 13:22:36] nullx: well
[2014-01-21 13:22:45] nullx: should I grab the trunk and compile it? or would that require a lot of work?
[2014-01-21 13:23:19] jimevans: nullx: you're welcome to try, but it does take more effort than just opening the solution in visual studio and hitting 'build'
[2014-01-21 13:23:27] nullx: I would imagine so
[2014-01-21 13:23:35] nullx: and it's not like I'm compiling a small program either
[2014-01-21 13:24:16] nullx: If there is any way you could help me get it, it'd be greatly appreciated

[2014-01-21 13:24:35] dogarrhea: kek. there's a "bug" only reproducible when selenium automation is running.
[2014-01-21 13:25:04] eaj, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-21 13:25:10] dogarrhea: but when I debug through these steps and follow along step by step on a same environment/different data but same use case scenario, it does not happen
[2014-01-21 13:25:21] jimevans: nullx: i really don't want to be an ass, but i don't have a tonne of time to create a private drop of the .net bindings at the moment.
[2014-01-21 13:25:49] nullx: no problem, you're not being an ass, it's a huge request
[2014-01-21 13:25:58] nullx: will do it on my own I guess
[2014-01-21 13:26:16] jimevans: once you get a build environment set up, it's pretty easy. it's the setup that's a pain in the ass.
[2014-01-21 13:26:23] nullx: makes sense
[2014-01-21 13:26:29] nullx: and then it's a long time compiling I'd imagine
[2014-01-21 13:26:32] nullx: being that these libraries are huge
[2014-01-21 13:26:45] jimevans: not really. the .net compilation is pretty quick actually.
[2014-01-21 13:26:51] nullx: ah cool

[2014-01-21 13:27:09] jimevans: it's the other stuff that takes awhile.
[2014-01-21 13:27:26] jimevans: like the firefox extension
[2014-01-21 13:27:30] nullx: ah
[2014-01-21 13:27:42] nullx: but it all has to be compiled simultaneously into one big dll I guess
[2014-01-21 13:27:42] admc1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-21 13:27:55] jimevans: which has to be embedded as a resource into the webdriver.dll assembly. easy enough, but it can't be done within visual studio.
[2014-01-21 13:28:03] nullx: ah no...
[2014-01-21 13:28:35] jimevans: if you're willing to live without firefox support, opening the solution and hitting 'build' will get you most of where you need to go.
[2014-01-21 13:28:40] nullx: yeah
[2014-01-21 13:28:43] nullx: I just need PhantomJS
[2014-01-21 13:28:48] nullx: I use that 100%
[2014-01-21 13:28:53] nullx: then awesome..
[2014-01-21 13:29:35] jimevans: fair warning, the solution is VS2010.
[2014-01-21 13:29:48] nullx: Actually have that installed
[2014-01-21 13:29:51] nullx: oddly enough
[2014-01-21 13:30:22] jimevans: once you get the source cloned, and the solution open, if you run into trouble, i can probably walk you through it.
[2014-01-21 13:30:29] nullx: much appreciated

[2014-01-21 13:33:51] dimacus: jimevans: how do i reach danielwh outside of IRC? Is there an email i can send him? Also, paperwork for VS2010 has been submitted. My manager said that we have been known for donating licenses for expensive tools to OSS projects before, so there is a high chance it will get aproved :)

[2014-01-21 13:37:04] lukeis: the jenkins box has changed ownership inside google
[2014-01-21 13:37:27] jimevans: nullx: .NET is mostly me. python is AutomatedTester and lukeis. ruby is jarib. java is whoever needs to make a change. jleyba is javascript. IE is me and sometimes ausavchuk (though he's been absent for a few months). chrome is handled by the chromium team. ghostdriver in phantomjs is detronizator_'s baby. firefox is mostly nobody (simonstewart and dawagner most recently), since the mozilla team is taking that over.
[2014-01-21 13:37:45] dimacus: lukeis: talk to him about adding a windows box to ci, adding VS2010 to it so that IEDriver binary is not commited into VCS but is combiled at build time and served as a build artifact for all to freely download
[2014-01-21 13:37:54] lukeis: dimacus: jleyba / sevaseva are the ones to ping if you want changes to it
