[2014-01-11 16:49:57] ato: Simos: You can make Selenium tests in anything.
[2014-01-11 16:50:21] ato: If you're considering Java, any fine editor will work.
[2014-01-11 16:51:54] Simos: ato: thanks :) i just started and i think for start to play with NetBeans (i have also installed IDEA Intellj too however)
[2014-01-11 16:52:12] ato: There are loads of popular editors.
[2014-01-11 16:52:21] ato: InteliJ, Eclipse, emacs, vi.
[2014-01-11 16:52:33] Simos: ato: the only problem so far is i don't know how to add the packages :/
[2014-01-11 16:52:51] ato: Unfortunately I don't know NetBeans.
[2014-01-11 16:52:51] Simos: ato: yeah! i love options :D
[2014-01-11 16:53:17] ato: Packages are added (in Java?) via the classpaht.
[2014-01-11 16:53:23] ato: classpath, sorry
[2014-01-11 16:53:33] Simos: ato: i found this article.... https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingStarted
[2014-01-11 16:53:56] Simos: ato: hm... ok. i'll add them in classpath
[2014-01-11 16:54:26] ato: If you're using the Java compiler from the terminal that'd be the -classpath or -cp argument to add the Selenium standalone JAR.
[2014-01-11 16:54:42] ato: In NetBeans I imagine there's an easier way.
[2014-01-11 16:54:50] alexglow, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-11 16:55:37] ato: FWIW you can use any language you want with Selenium.  It doesn't have to be Java.
[2014-01-11 16:57:05] Simos: ato: indeed. i'm also thinking of python
[2014-01-11 16:57:26] ato: Use whichever you're more comfortable in.
[2014-01-11 16:57:32] ato: That's my recommendation.
[2014-01-11 16:58:24] Simos: ato: what you use?
[2014-01-11 16:59:02] ato: I use the best tool for the job (-:
[2014-01-11 17:00:15] ato: As far as WebDriver's concerned it doesn't really matter what language you pick.
[2014-01-11 17:00:17] Simos: ato: hehe! well, i just try to learn Selenium so i'm free to experiment
[2014-01-11 17:00:33] ato: Python, Java, Ruby, C# are all officially supported.
[2014-01-11 17:00:45] Simos: ato: +1
[2014-01-11 17:01:01] ato: The syntax is /mostly/ the same.
[2014-01-11 17:01:14] ato: With some language peculiarities.
[2014-01-11 17:02:01] alexglow, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2014-01-11 17:03:59] Simos: ato: yes. to be honest, i don't know why most books stay to java
[2014-01-11 17:04:57] tony1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-11 17:05:43] ato: Java is a pretty popular language that has a lot of advantages.  So a lot of organizations use it.
[2014-01-11 17:07:53] Simos: ato: i see.... i'll stay with it but i'll keep an eye open for other languages too.
[2014-01-11 17:08:19] ato: Depends what you want to do.
[2014-01-11 17:08:54] ato: Usually it makes little difference what you pick.
[2014-01-11 17:09:25] ato: If specifically looking for something well documented in Selenium, those languages I mentioned earlier are good picks.
[2014-01-11 17:09:42] ato: All of the authors regularly hang in this channel.
[2014-01-11 17:11:08] Simos: ato: thanks for letting me know :)
