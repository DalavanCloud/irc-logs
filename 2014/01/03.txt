[2014-01-03 09:58:52] simplex_: hey guys
[2014-01-03 09:59:02] simplex_: does anybody know hpw to do the following:
[2014-01-03 10:00:10] simplex_: i have one server and multiple drivers which connect to it. i want to delete all the cookies and data from the server, but for one driver only
[2014-01-03 10:00:14] simplex_: is that possible?
[2014-01-03 10:02:13] simplex_: i found driver.Manage.Cookies.DeleteAllCookies
[2014-01-03 10:02:26] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-03 10:02:31] simplex_: does that delete the cookies for this driver only or for all drivers which connect to the server?
[2014-01-03 10:02:55] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-03 10:03:55] plightbo_work, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-01-03 10:04:19] jimevans: simplex_: that should delete the cookies for the current browser instance only.
[2014-01-03 10:05:14] simplex_: so even if i have 10 drivers which connect to one phantomjs server on the same port, it will delete the cookie only for that driver?
[2014-01-03 10:06:05] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure.
[2014-01-03 10:06:32] detronizator_: nope - only for that session
[2014-01-03 10:06:33] detronizator_: BUT
[2014-01-03 10:06:39] detronizator_: if different sessions
[2014-01-03 10:06:42] jimevans: are you launching phantomjs.exe directly as your "server", or are you running the remote webdriver server and letting it manage the phantomjs instances?
[2014-01-03 10:06:43] detronizator_: are on the same domain
[2014-01-03 10:06:57] detronizator_: you will delete the cookies from the same domain, cross-session
[2014-01-03 10:07:23] detronizator_: this happens because, currently, PhantomJS shares cookiejar across sessions
[2014-01-03 10:07:59] simplex_: yes i run one remote server and the connect multiple times
[2014-01-03 10:08:04] simplex_: thanks for the info!
[2014-01-03 10:08:10] detronizator_: my advice: if you need parallelism AND on the same domain, use different phantomjs servers (the drivers should be able to launch it by themselves)
[2014-01-03 10:08:12] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-03 10:08:34] detronizator_: that made me remember: we have a PR on PhantomJS addressing the multi-cookiejar need
[2014-01-03 10:08:38] detronizator_: I need to take a look at that
[2014-01-03 10:10:28] simplex_: one thing i don't understand is, when i instantiate a driver in .Net, it will automatically start a new server for that driver - but it is A LOT faster when i just use one server for multiple drivers (as long as these are not on the same domain)
[2014-01-03 10:11:14] simplex_: but for that behavoiur i need to start everything by myself (remote style)
[2014-01-03 10:11:24] jimevans: simplex_: yep. that's by design.
[2014-01-03 10:11:25] simplex_: with manual port management
[2014-01-03 10:12:01] Dave_B_, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)

[2014-01-03 10:13:36] simplex_: no it's not hard at all :)
[2014-01-03 10:13:50] simplex_: btw thanks jimevans for having a look at my .net code some time ago
[2014-01-03 10:14:15] jimevans: no problem, though true confessions, i don't remember looking at it. :)
[2014-01-03 10:15:13] simplex_: it was about an element which was clearly visible but i got a not visible excaption...
[2014-01-03 10:15:35] simplex_: it turned out that there were 2 elements, of which one was not visible...
[2014-01-03 10:15:43] jimevans: oh, right. now i remember.

[2014-01-03 10:18:05] simplex_: but i found a site now in which there is only one element which is clearly visible, but phantomjs still throws and error... it was actually that site i meant... seems to be a bug in phantomjs unfortunately

[2014-01-03 10:18:33] simplex_: maybe they fix that kind of behaviour some day ..

[2014-01-03 10:20:18] detronizator_: Visibility depends on The window size. Are you sure The element isn't just outside of the default viewport size?
[2014-01-03 10:20:26] detronizator_: Have you tried to resize first?
[2014-01-03 10:20:30] simplex_: yes, 100%
[2014-01-03 10:20:40] simplex_: sure

[2014-01-03 10:24:39] simplex_: I really like phantomjs a lot, mostly because of it's speed, but unfortunately, it still has issues with some (js heavy) sites.
[2014-01-03 10:25:21] jimevans: well, it's running a javascript engine that isn't used by any production browser, so i'm sure there are some discrepancies there.
[2014-01-03 10:26:00] jimevans: any major production browser, anyway
[2014-01-03 10:26:14] detronizator_: jimevans: that is "was" in use (Safari) - until next release, where it will catch up with a more recent JavascriptCore version
[2014-01-03 10:26:28] detronizator_: it's just that QtWebkit is slow at updating
[2014-01-03 10:26:38] jimevans: i didn't think safari used javascriptcore.
[2014-01-03 10:26:42] detronizator_: finger crossed for a good Qt Chromium Binding
[2014-01-03 10:26:47] detronizator_: it did
[2014-01-03 10:26:51] simplex_: yes that's what i thought. But for people who are running headless test with selenium and .net, phantomjs i the only way to go
[2014-01-03 10:26:56] jimevans: i thought they had their own engine now (nitro?)
[2014-01-03 10:26:59] detronizator_: now they moved to WebKit2

[2014-01-03 10:27:29] detronizator_: yes, they use WebKit2 + Nitro now
[2014-01-03 10:27:38] detronizator_: I was thinking back 1/2 years
[2014-01-03 10:27:58] detronizator_: I know... in the web world 2 years it's like prehistory
[2014-01-03 10:27:59] detronizator_: :)
[2014-01-03 10:31:11] simplex_: anybody knows when the 2.x series of phantomjs will be released?
[2014-01-03 10:32:14] jimevans: simplex_: when it's ready?
[2014-01-03 10:32:35] jimevans: there's a fair amount of work to be done to move to Qt5.

[2014-01-03 10:32:51] detronizator_: jimevans: what jimevans says
[2014-01-03 10:33:06] detronizator_: if you want to monitor progress (or help!) https://github.com/Vitallium/phantomjs-qt5
[2014-01-03 10:33:11] detronizator_: this is where stuff is happening
[2014-01-03 10:33:30] detronizator_: it's such a set of changes, Vitaily found easier to just have a separate repo for now
[2014-01-03 10:33:34] detronizator_: and merge in once ready
[2014-01-03 10:33:46] detronizator_: there are 3 key issues, specific to the 3 major OS
[2014-01-03 10:34:44] simplex_: I can't wait for it ;)
[2014-01-03 10:35:08] simplex_: is it a lot of work to integrate it with selenium?
[2014-01-03 10:35:57] sebv, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-03 10:36:32] jimevans: there's literally zero work to be done on the webdriver side to make it work with phantomjs. all of the work is on the phantomjs side.
[2014-01-03 10:36:53] detronizator_: jimevans: you seem very optimistic today :)
[2014-01-03 10:37:00] detronizator_: jimevans: I HOPE it's like you says
[2014-01-03 10:37:09] detronizator_: as Vitailly is working to maintain 100% API compatibility
[2014-01-03 10:37:28] detronizator_: BUT I have enough experience to believe that EVEN if we get API compatibility in signature
[2014-01-03 10:37:36] detronizator_: we might end up with slightly different (better?) behaviours
[2014-01-03 10:37:51] detronizator_: that will require in the end to 1) adapt 2) remove workarounds 3) ???
[2014-01-03 10:37:59] jimevans: well any api changes happen inside phantomjs, and that's where the work is done.
[2014-01-03 10:38:00] detronizator_: luckly, after that... 4) profit!
[2014-01-03 10:38:37] jimevans: from the language bindings standpoint, unless a command-line argument changes, there's no language-level work to be done.
[2014-01-03 10:39:38] detronizator_: bindings YES, of course
[2014-01-03 10:39:49] detronizator_: but bindings are the smallest part of GhostDriver
[2014-01-03 10:39:55] simplex__, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-01-03 10:39:56] detronizator_: the meat is in the server side
[2014-01-03 10:40:45] detronizator_: I have some fundamental workarounds in place to circumvent some of the issues in QWebView slot bindings
[2014-01-03 10:40:52] detronizator_: that I HOPE I can rip off in Qt5
[2014-01-03 10:41:05] detronizator_: also, the webserver module... it's dreadful
[2014-01-03 10:41:20] detronizator_: we have such a terrible integration of mongoose (that is also very much out of date)
[2014-01-03 10:41:54] detronizator_: jimevans: simplex_: in other words, I'm setting the stage for "it's going to take a while". If we get an easy adaptation and quick release... all the merrier
[2014-01-03 10:42:06] detronizator_: I don't want to do a Selenium 3 kind of mistake :P

[2014-01-03 10:43:11] simplex__: bad news then
[2014-01-03 10:43:29] detronizator_: no - just "keep an eye on phantomjs qt5 for now"
[2014-01-03 10:44:26] detronizator_: UNLESS someone else does the work of testing/verifying/porting ghostdriver to PhantomJSQT5 for me - in that case it might be faster/sooner - currently I'm pretty much still alone (minus some great contributions I got in 1.1.0)

[2014-01-03 12:26:20] llaskin: lukeis: i'm really hitting a brick wall trying to get how this threadlocal thing works...
[2014-01-03 12:26:40] llaskin: and why that has anything to do with the maven surefire plugin working
[2014-01-03 12:27:07] lukeis: it has to do with how your tests will 'work' in the multi-threaded environment
[2014-01-03 12:27:13] lukeis: how do you instantiate the driver?
[2014-01-03 12:27:22] llaskin: every test instantiates it itself
[2014-01-03 12:27:24] lukeis: is it in a setup method? is it global? is it?
[2014-01-03 12:27:39] lukeis: do you have common code doing that?
[2014-01-03 12:27:55] llaskin: https://gist.github.com/llaskin/787bc1736d6a4dd402ff
[2014-01-03 12:30:05] llaskin: and that is called in @Before via "driver = WebDriverWrapper.getWebDriver();"
[2014-01-03 12:30:26] lukeis: ok, so I would say in getWebDriver(){  you should have a check for if (driverForThread.get() != null) return driverForThread.get();      and then at the bottom of the method, before you return driver you call driverForThread.set(driver);
[2014-01-03 12:31:47] lukeis: also closeBrowser should clear driverForThread

[2014-01-03 14:25:36] davidlai: I'm looking at these lines and wondering, how 'driver' gets instantiated.
[2014-01-03 14:25:38] lzQA: hey david... really appreciated for getting back to me
[2014-01-03 14:25:56] lzQA: but no worries, jimevans helped out a bit

[2014-01-03 14:26:23] lzQA: yeah, that initElments was the culprit
[2014-01-03 14:26:40] davidlai: cool.
[2014-01-03 14:26:57] lzQA: i init it before assigning the remotewebdrive
[2014-01-03 14:27:10] lzQA: it was an issue with my code
