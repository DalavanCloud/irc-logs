[2014-08-01 01:55:16] Timvde: Hi. A few weeks ago, I learned about the page object pattern here. Now, I think I did it wrong :)
[2014-08-01 01:56:25] Timvde: For example, my home page class has a "click_login_button()" method (and others), but now I want to check if there is a log in button available when I'm logged out (and vice versa)

[2014-08-01 01:56:36] Neo--, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-01 01:57:31] Timvde: So I was wondering if it wouldn't be better to have a "get_login_button()" function, and use get_login_button().click() in my tests, and I can check if get_login_button() is None

[2014-08-01 02:24:54] Dave_B_: noone answered in the meantime
[2014-08-01 02:25:07] Dave_B_: obviously you can do it how you feel comfortable
[2014-08-01 02:25:57] Dave_B_: I personally make elements like login buttons properties of the page so if people want to check they're present/displayed they can, but most interaction is done via methods rather than by interacting with the elements directly
[2014-08-01 02:26:27] Timvde: Dave_B_: So you do it with a hybrid approach?
[2014-08-01 02:26:34] Dave_B_: e.g. I'll have a username_field, passwrod_field, login_button and then a method like login(username, password)
[2014-08-01 02:26:52] Dave_B_: yeah kind of
[2014-08-01 02:27:12] Dave_B_: I try to avoid people needing to use web elements (or understand them at all) to drive interactions
[2014-08-01 02:27:24] Dave_B_: but i keep them accessible so that people can make assertions on them if they wish
[2014-08-01 02:28:39] Dave_B_: not sure what people recommend - that's just my personal approach
[2014-08-01 02:28:39] Timvde: Dave_B_: That was my concern too :) Especially because we have text boxes that are enhanced with JavaScript, and I need to do some extra stuff to interact with them (like, first clearing them)
[2014-08-01 02:28:59] Dave_B_: yeah so my methods do the clearing etc :)

[2014-08-01 02:43:25] Dave_B_: oh, one thing I didn't say - if you do similarly to me then make sure the properties are not all initialised on object creation, or everything will run slowly and your tests will be more fragile (e.g. missing login button will kill every test that visits that page, even if the test has no interest in the login button)
[2014-08-01 02:44:08] Timvde: Dave_B_: I have methods with an @property tag :)
[2014-08-01 02:44:17] Dave_B_: exactly the same as me :)
[2014-08-01 02:45:00] Timvde: And try/except around each call, so it just returns None if it doesn't exist
[2014-08-01 02:46:25] davehunt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-08-01 02:46:29] Timvde: Dave_B_: So, where do you actually get the elements? In your object classes? I had them in my base page before, but I think I should move them.
[2014-08-01 02:46:43] Dave_B_: ah fair enough, I just let mine throw at the moment but I'm not sure if that is a good thing or not - makes it quick to work out what went wrong but also can be a bit annoying when I want to verify something is not present as the tests then need to know about NoSuchElementExceptions which isn't great
[2014-08-01 02:46:55] Dave_B_: I get my elements in my object classes
[2014-08-01 02:46:59] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-01 02:47:17] Dave_B_: well, some are in base page as they're shared between all pages i deal with
[2014-08-01 02:47:36] Timvde: Navigation and such?
[2014-08-01 02:47:47] Dave_B_: yeah
[2014-08-01 02:48:25] davehunt, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-08-01 02:48:29] Dave_B_: actually, i lie, i moved them out of base page, and just included the navigation object in base page instead so kinda the same but they still live in a separate object
[2014-08-01 02:48:53] Timvde: Atm I have a list in my base page like |def click_by_id()|, |def fill_form_by_value"..., but the more I think of it, the more I think that it's not meant to look like that

[2014-08-01 02:51:50] Dave_B_: i do have some methods like you mention for e.g. selecting from options by text or value or whatever, but just have them as a separate helper function
[2014-08-01 02:51:52] operatiay, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-08-01 02:52:11] Dave_B_: not sure it's a good idea though, as i have to keep importing them all over the place :(
[2014-08-01 02:52:28] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-01 02:52:42] Dave_B_: probably should create an option class that each option webelement can be, which would then give me these methods
[2014-08-01 02:52:46] Timvde: It sounds to me that they're better in the page objects themselves
[2014-08-01 02:53:02] Timvde: Like, just interact with Selenium there
[2014-08-01 02:53:17] Dave_B_: yeah probably

[2014-08-01 03:10:18] Timvde: Dave_B_: Ah, damn. The login button creates an AJAX pop-up, and with the element I made, I changed the duplicate CSS to: WebDriverWait(..).until(EC.visibility_of(self.username_field)
[2014-08-01 03:10:27] Timvde: (with EC being expected conditions)
[2014-08-01 03:10:37] Timvde: but now it errors on visibility_of(none) :(
[2014-08-01 03:10:41] Timvde: s/none/None/
[2014-08-01 03:10:46] Dave_B_: ah nuts
[2014-08-01 03:11:06] Dave_B_: downside of returning none instead of letting the exception propagate!
[2014-08-01 03:11:10] Dave_B_: hadn't thought of that
[2014-08-01 03:11:19] Timvde: Dave_B_: Wouldn't there still be an exception otherwise?
[2014-08-01 03:11:45] Dave_B_: yes, but WebDriverWait ignores NoSuchElementException by default I think
[2014-08-01 03:11:52] Timvde: Ah, let's test it :)
[2014-08-01 03:12:01] Dave_B_: :D good luck!
[2014-08-01 03:12:09] Timvde: That.. seems to work!
[2014-08-01 03:12:28] Dave_B_: woohoo
[2014-08-01 03:12:45] Timvde: I guess I'll just assert for the exception in my tests instead of None :)

[2014-08-01 10:43:43] jimevans: actually, i've done it both ways, in a dictionary with the command name as the key and the value as a tuple with the verb and url, and i've keyed off the url and the verb to get the command name. depends on whether you're doing server side or client side.
[2014-08-01 10:44:09] jimevans: usually if you're doing server side, it makes more sense to do the second, i guess.

[2014-08-01 10:48:01] jimevans: i was thinking about taking a crack at writing a shim for marionette myself in c++.
[2014-08-01 10:48:07] jimevans: because runtimes.

[2014-08-01 10:51:12] ato: I need this to be in Python.
[2014-08-01 10:51:28] ato: I've already done a prototype in Go which is never going to be used.
[2014-08-01 10:51:50] Choicefresh: scratch that; i'm stupid
[2014-08-01 10:52:02] jimevans: is the intent for the python one to be the "official" shim?
[2014-08-01 10:52:30] ato: The intent is for it to be easy to use with wptrunner.
[2014-08-01 10:53:13] jimevans: i see.
[2014-08-01 10:54:18] ato: Well I suppose it could be written in any language.
[2014-08-01 10:55:23] jimevans: as long as the language runtime is available, right?
[2014-08-01 10:55:49] Simos_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-01 10:55:58] ato: It's just that Marionette in Python has a few functions to do the socket translation bits.
[2014-08-01 10:56:02] jimevans: which, for wptrunner, python must be.
[2014-08-01 10:56:10] ato: But those are easy to rewrite in any language.
[2014-08-01 10:56:18] ato: wptrunner is Python, yes.
[2014-08-01 10:56:53] jimevans: that, incidentally, is my objection to the "official" marionette shim being implemented in python.
[2014-08-01 10:57:13] jimevans: that for some OS configurations, it requires a separate runtime install.
[2014-08-01 10:57:55] jimevans: i know it's a stupid objection to some people, but it matters to me.
[2014-08-01 10:59:29] ato: I hadn't taken a position to that yet.
[2014-08-01 10:59:54] jimevans: i've thought about it a great deal.
