[2014-08-02 10:09:51] dude-x: Metaculus: seems like you need to wait; look up using WebDriverWait
[2014-08-02 10:10:04] dude-x: your code is good, but i think there is javascript that occurs
[2014-08-02 10:10:48] Eleccy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-02 10:12:16] dude-x: pa: 1) no 2) use casperJS, slimerJS for headless gecko, no guarnatee it works the same as regular firefox
[2014-08-02 10:13:19] dude-x: Metaculus: simplest solution put a time.sleep(2) and see if the code works
[2014-08-02 10:13:45] dude-x: if that's the case, then you have to use WebDriverWait, i suspect that the modal is using some fancy javascript toolkit to animate the modal
[2014-08-02 10:13:59] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-02 10:19:47] Metaculus: dude-x: yeah
[2014-08-02 10:20:11] Metaculus: You mean self.browser.implicitly_wait(5) like that?
[2014-08-02 10:20:24] dude-x: implicit waits are not recommended but you can do that starting out
[2014-08-02 10:20:52] Metaculus: just put time.sleep(2) before that line then
[2014-08-02 10:21:15] dude-x: well try implciit waits for now
[2014-08-02 10:21:21] dude-x: it will make most tests cases easier
[2014-08-02 10:21:35] dude-x: but once you start using WebDriverWait, the two will clash and make your scripts twice as slow
[2014-08-02 10:22:10] Metaculus: implicit wait doesn't help
[2014-08-02 10:22:27] dude-x: actually it won't help at all in this case
[2014-08-02 10:22:34] dude-x: because of that modal doing stuff
[2014-08-02 10:22:41] dude-x: put a time.sleep
[2014-08-02 10:28:28] Metaculus: modal doing stuff?

[2014-08-02 10:33:03] Metaculus: dude-x: not working. Just fyi, I'm putting the modal's html just before </body>, as suggested by bootstrap to put it at top level of the html
[2014-08-02 10:33:16] dude-x: it's in HTML?
[2014-08-02 10:33:17] dude-x: hmm
[2014-08-02 10:33:26] dude-x: shouldn't matter i think
[2014-08-02 10:33:26] Metaculus: but it's hidden. I put it there just to test. No trigger event for it yet. Is that a problem?
[2014-08-02 10:33:41] dude-x: if you can't see it in the browser, you can't get the text for t
[2014-08-02 10:33:57] dude-x: but you should still be able to retreive the element
[2014-08-02 10:34:03] Metaculus: I have heard from #django room that webdriver won't test what user can't see.
[2014-08-02 10:34:16] Metaculus: Yes, I can retrieve the element, but not its text.
[2014-08-02 10:34:17] dude-x: that's true
[2014-08-02 10:34:22] Metaculus: is that the case?
[2014-08-02 10:35:24] Metaculus: So that assertTrue(self.browser.find_element_by_css_selector('.modal h1').text passes, just that it couldn't find its text, just empty unicode string.
[2014-08-02 10:35:26] dude-x: based on what i see
[2014-08-02 10:35:42] dude-x: it's retreiving the element
[2014-08-02 10:35:49] dude-x: and the element passes the visiblity test
[2014-08-02 10:36:08] dude-x: but the text is not visible on screen so it retreives the empty string

[2014-08-02 13:15:49] dude-x: marionette is available but it's not at 1.0 spec; and you still have to use the marionette driver and not the selenium driver
