[2014-08-08 02:09:50] Joe_____: Hello, guys. I have a problem with my Selenium IDE and I don't know how to resolve it. When I type command in "Command field", here not working auto-complete. Example: I typing "op" and IDE shows drop-down list with commands (open, openWindow). I selected "open" command but in field this command not appears. Same thing with "Target field" when I want to change target format. I re-installed FireFox and Selenium IDE but the problem
[2014-08-08 02:12:29] Joe_____: Somebody had same problem?
[2014-08-08 02:16:04] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe_____: yes this is a known bug in the latest version of firefox with the ide
[2014-08-08 02:16:12] WhereIsMySpoon: no it probably isnt going to get fixed soon
[2014-08-08 02:16:33] WhereIsMySpoon: stop using the ide
[2014-08-08 02:16:39] WhereIsMySpoon: start coding your tests properly

[2014-08-08 02:35:42] JustMozzy: Here is my node output http://pastebin.com/ef8wjrqX

[2014-08-08 03:08:03] JustMozzy: Dave_B_: do you have an example?
[2014-08-08 03:08:41] Dave_B_: no idea what language you use, but i'll try to whip up one for you
[2014-08-08 03:09:24] Dave_B_: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/d084b9efb960f37be70e
[2014-08-08 03:09:27] Dave_B_: something like that
[2014-08-08 03:09:46] Dave_B_: obviously you'll need the other browsers available with right drivers etc
[2014-08-08 03:11:06] Dave_B_: and if you don't use python then you'd need to translate to whatever language you do use :)
[2014-08-08 03:11:43] andcie: hi I have to find timeline vebpage and click on it

[2014-08-08 03:11:58] andcie: <li ng-class="{active: !profile.summaryActive}"><a ng-click="selectTab('timeline')"><span><span class="svgi icon-timeline-view"></span>

[2014-08-08 03:12:23] JustMozzy: Dave_B_: ah alright. am actually using python (with needle automated tests). so it is complaining because I don't have the IE driver locally installed. if I install it on one of the connected nodes in my hub, then the hub should automatically detect the node that has IE, no?
[2014-08-08 03:12:43] andcie: I used
[2014-08-08 03:12:48] andcie: protected Link TimeLineLink = new Link(By.cssSelector(".icon-timeline-view"));
[2014-08-08 03:13:25] andcie: but I have got  org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element
[2014-08-08 03:13:54] andcie: it means that css in not correct
[2014-08-08 03:14:08] andcie: I don't really see any other optiopns
[2014-08-08 03:14:21] Dave_B_: JustMozzy: The node that has IE available should be configured so that the hub knows that node has IE available and then it'll send the request to the right node
[2014-08-08 03:15:06] Dave_B_: see http://selenium.polteq.com/en/launch-selenium-node-with-a-json-configuration-file/ for an example (I've not actually read that so it might be rubbish, but looks like a node config at a glance)
[2014-08-08 03:15:22] JustMozzy: Dave_B_: thanks :) you're really helpful
[2014-08-08 03:15:44] Dave_B_: no worries, good luck! :)
[2014-08-08 03:17:04] Dave_B_: andcie: Have you checked to ensure you're not inside an iframe? In which case you'll need to switch to it first
[2014-08-08 03:17:46] Dave_B_: also, is that lookup going from base driver or from another web element? In which case it'll fail if the span is not a child of that web element
[2014-08-08 03:19:03] Dave_B_: having spaces in class names messes with my head as that makes it have 2 class names right?
[2014-08-08 03:19:19] Dave_B_: you could try: protected Link TimeLineLink = new Link(By.cssSelector("span[class*='icon-timeline-view']"));

[2014-08-08 07:09:25] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: all my pages inherit from my CommonPage class, which has PageFactory.initElements(driver, this) in iuts constructor
[2014-08-08 07:09:59] simonstewart: So how is the field initialized? What sets its value?
[2014-08-08 07:10:04] simonstewart: PageFactory isn’t aware of Selects
[2014-08-08 07:10:20] WhereIsMySpoon: er...it has an @FindBy?
[2014-08-08 07:10:29] WhereIsMySpoon: same as how my webelements are set
[2014-08-08 07:10:38] simonstewart: But, and this is the important point, PageFactory isn’t aware of Selects
[2014-08-08 07:10:43] simonstewart: It ignores the field
[2014-08-08 07:10:43] WhereIsMySpoon: yes ok
[2014-08-08 07:10:55] WhereIsMySpoon: is there a way I can make it aware?
[2014-08-08 07:11:13] WhereIsMySpoon: not from my side right?
[2014-08-08 07:11:30] simonstewart: Deep in the buck code right now
[2014-08-08 07:11:39] simonstewart: but the page factory takes an element factory
[2014-08-08 07:11:51] simonstewart: You need to write one that’s Select aware
[2014-08-08 07:11:59] simonstewart: There’s a helper “Annotations” class you might find useful
[2014-08-08 07:12:19] WhereIsMySpoon: i know theres a constructor for initElements that can take a factory
[2014-08-08 07:12:26] simonstewart: yeah, that one
[2014-08-08 07:12:27] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess I could write my own and put that in there
[2014-08-08 07:12:29] WhereIsMySpoon: meh
[2014-08-08 07:12:31] WhereIsMySpoon: not worth it lol
[2014-08-08 07:12:38] simonstewart: Ha!
[2014-08-08 07:12:40] WhereIsMySpoon: i'll just make them webelements and cast to select

[2014-08-08 09:01:54] dude-x: i am going to chalk it up to an error in the chromedriver or in Chrome 36

[2014-08-08 09:02:25] dude-x: Chrome is complaining about the call stack
[2014-08-08 09:02:41] dude-x: maybe needle is using some unusual commands to set up  Chrome

[2014-08-08 09:04:57] JustMozzy_: dude-x: looks like it. seems the error comes up when I try to resize the viewport. I am using a method from needle to resize the viewport.
[2014-08-08 09:06:08] dude-x: there is probably some way to set the size of the window through the chrome options
[2014-08-08 09:07:20] JustMozzy_: dude-x: hmm... you mean in the test itself?
[2014-08-08 09:07:33] dude-x: you may have to dig through needle's source
[2014-08-08 09:07:48] dude-x: btw, does needle do fast image comparisons?
[2014-08-08 09:07:58] dude-x: i might want to use somethnig like this for my testing
[2014-08-08 09:08:57] JustMozzy_: dude-x: it is pretty fast, especially if you use perceptualdiff. it will then also make a diff image, very useful
[2014-08-08 09:09:29] dude-x: can i just use the image comparison library without the test framework aspect?
[2014-08-08 09:11:03] JustMozzy_: dude-x: from needle's code I see that they are using a ImageDiff class (python) to do the comparision
[2014-08-08 09:13:14] JustMozzy_: dude-x: or have a look at perceptualdiff http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/

[2014-08-08 09:16:24] JustMozzy_: hmm... so I commented the line where the error was thrown before. the chromedriver is complaining about all javascript calls
[2014-08-08 09:17:19] dude-x: bizarre
[2014-08-08 09:17:30] dude-x: i think needle probably puts in a shim
[2014-08-08 09:17:36] dude-x: does needle docs say it supports chrome
[2014-08-08 09:17:50] JustMozzy_: dude-x: yupp
[2014-08-08 09:18:17] JustMozzy_: but the docs are very short
[2014-08-08 09:19:12] dude-x: i'm at a loss, look at the chromedriver issues page and see if someone posted an issue
[2014-08-08 09:20:05] JustMozzy_: dude-x: yeah looks like it is not from needle. the error is thrown in c:\Python34\lib\site-packages\selenium\webdriver\remote\webdriver.py in "execute_script"
[2014-08-08 09:20:41] dude-x: it's returning call stack error from the javascript inside chrome
