[2014-08-25 05:46:36] barancev: we missed two releases of Firefox
[2014-08-25 05:46:38] AS: ESR
[2014-08-25 05:46:55] barancev: and it is true for native events only
[2014-08-25 05:47:10] barancev: synthesized events are supported in all versions starting from FF4
[2014-08-25 05:50:55] AS: so it means i can't use ff version > 29 if i want to use native events?

[2014-08-25 05:55:14] barancev: right
[2014-08-25 05:55:42] barancev: but you can stop wanting native events and use the latest FF :)

[2014-08-25 05:57:46] AS: I am already using latest FF :) but for tests we are using ActionChains so as per my understanding we can't use latest FF until python selenium client is available with native event support for latest FF
[2014-08-25 05:58:54] barancev: actionchain can work without native events, but sometimes it does not (for some exotic elements and situations)
[2014-08-25 05:59:32] barancev: is something is not working with synthesize element it is a sort of a bug, you can report it
[2014-08-25 06:00:07] AS: yeah, due to this "sometimes thing" we don't want to run our tests with latest FF
[2014-08-25 06:00:49] AS: really...i didn't know that if something is not working with synthesize events, then we can report a bug
[2014-08-25 06:01:03] barancev: you'd better try and report issues (well, better for use, may be not for you :) )
[2014-08-25 06:01:30] barancev: s/better for use/bette for us/
[2014-08-25 06:01:48] AS: yeah...great
[2014-08-25 06:02:02] AS: i will definitely try latest FF with tests
