[2014-08-26 07:57:50] tourdedave: I'm trying to set a high timeout for intentionally slow running tests (e.g., limited bandwidth) and driver.manage.timeouts.page_load on a get action doesn't seem to be extending the timeout (even though that's what it says in the code comments). Is that right? Or am I missing something?

[2014-08-26 13:07:01] lukeis: you writing a lot of JS code lately? ;)
[2014-08-26 13:07:32] ato: I have, but I have a concrete problem where I'd want to inject a script which doesn't return until I would execute some other commands in the mean time.
[2014-08-26 13:11:56] lukeis: do your own threading ;)

[2014-08-26 13:12:27] ato: Well you can't.
[2014-08-26 13:12:45] lukeis: oh, you mean another command to the driver?
[2014-08-26 13:12:52] lukeis: well, depends on the driver really ;)
[2014-08-26 13:12:56] ato: Although not defined in the spec webdriver is blocking also on the remote end.
[2014-08-26 13:13:04] ato: The driver will accumulate commands and put them in a queue.
[2014-08-26 13:13:12] lukeis: depends on the driver :)
[2014-08-26 13:13:22] lukeis: selendroid will just reply if it can
[2014-08-26 13:13:33] ato: Right.  It feels this is something we should define.
[2014-08-26 13:13:43] lukeis: some interactions may cause undefined behavior if you do simultaneously
[2014-08-26 13:13:45] ato: But I'm mightly annoyed that I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
[2014-08-26 13:14:09] dimacus: jimevans: saw your comment here http://kenhirakawa.com/selenium-unable-to-add-cookie-to-page/
[2014-08-26 13:14:16] lukeis: ato: welcome to my last few weeks :'(
[2014-08-26 13:14:37] jimevans: dimacus: yes?
[2014-08-26 13:14:41] dimacus: jimevans: wondering if that's still the case, i keep getting error setting cookies on IE browsers and no clue why
[2014-08-26 13:14:46] dimacus: it's so intermitent
[2014-08-26 13:15:52] jimevans: so, the issue specifically mentioned by that blog post was fixed. never said it was the only issue in that area.
[2014-08-26 13:15:54] jimevans: :)
[2014-08-26 13:16:02] dimacus: ahhahahahah ok
[2014-08-26 13:16:04] jimevans: also, logs might help.
[2014-08-26 13:16:26] Neo--, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-26 13:16:28] dimacus: yeah don't have those at the moment will have to write some configs to actually output logs
[2014-08-26 13:16:37] jimevans: yes, there was a bug in the algorithm to determine if we really were on an HTML page.
[2014-08-26 13:16:42] jimevans: it's since been fixed.
[2014-08-26 13:17:05] dimacus: cool, i'll keep digging at this then
[2014-08-26 13:17:16] jleyba: dimacus, I've found setting cookies via executeScript("document.cookie=...") is reliable cross browser
[2014-08-26 13:17:16] dimacus: i feel like i'm super close though
[2014-08-26 13:18:26] dimacus: jleyba: thank you i'll give that a try
[2014-08-26 13:18:35] dimacus: jimevans: here is a possible cause, wanna run it by you
[2014-08-26 13:18:46] dimacus: if the cooke set command is called when the page is not 100% loaded
[2014-08-26 13:18:58] dimacus: could this be the reason? since the current page context might not be fully set
[2014-08-26 13:18:58] ashb_, quitting. (Quit: ashb_)
[2014-08-26 13:19:01] jimevans: deep, deep down, that's what the IE driver is doing, but the driver is using the COM object to do it instead of the script.

[2014-08-26 13:20:11] *jleyba is glad he doesn't really have to worry about these issues any more unless he wants to... which he rarely does'
[2014-08-26 13:20:23] jimevans: i suppose i could rig the method that does the cookie add to pass a more substantial string back to the caller via a string pointer (ugh)
[2014-08-26 13:21:14] ato: lukeis: Are you solving a similar problem?
[2014-08-26 13:21:47] ato: lukeis: I have an injected JS which does window.open, and the document it opens doesn't return until another webdriver command is sent.
[2014-08-26 13:21:49] ashb_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-26 13:21:54] dimacus: jimevans: let me see if i can make issue go away by explicitly asking if the page fully loaded first
[2014-08-26 13:22:08] dimacus: if the issue goes away 100% i'll have a detailed bug report
[2014-08-26 13:22:22] jimevans: or rather, i guess i should have those methods return a struct containing the status code and an error message (if any), but that's a more intrusive change.
[2014-08-26 13:22:26] jleyba: ato: can you setTimeout(window.open)?
[2014-08-26 13:22:45] jimevans: dimacus: either way, that'd be a big help.
[2014-08-26 13:22:51] ato: jleyba: I was actually just playing around with that but can't tell if it works or if I have other code that's buggy.
[2014-08-26 13:22:54] lukeis: ato: no… i'm solving… shit is broken and doesn't work in our CI environment (only in CI, not locally of course)…. compound errors… lots of things have changed, too many moving pieces and can't rollback everything
[2014-08-26 13:23:15] dimacus: jimevans: yeah i've been chasing this one for about 2 weeks, happens roughly once a day
[2014-08-26 13:23:31] jleyba: ato what driver are you using?
[2014-08-26 13:23:31] jimevans: certainly sounds timing-related.
[2014-08-26 13:24:59] dimacus: ok thanks for the tip good sir
