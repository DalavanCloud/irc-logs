[2014-08-28 06:43:41] WhereIsMySpoon: =/
[2014-08-28 06:43:45] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i'm rather in favor of removing support for switching by name altogether, but that will never happen.
[2014-08-28 06:43:47] ato: The right thing would be to raise a bug against the spec if you really think the WG should discuss it.
[2014-08-28 06:44:06] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: what? how on earth are you going to reliably switch windows then?
[2014-08-28 06:44:19] jimevans: window handles. that's what they're designed for.
[2014-08-28 06:44:21] WhereIsMySpoon: iterate switching through all open windows until 1 has an element you're looking for?
[2014-08-28 06:44:21] ato: jimevans: I think there are legitimate use cases for switching by name.
[2014-08-28 06:44:35] jimevans: and before you complain about iterating over them, remember that you only write that code once.
[2014-08-28 06:44:36] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: how do window handle-s solve anything? theyre random letters and numbers
[2014-08-28 06:44:40] WhereIsMySpoon: handles*
[2014-08-28 06:44:59] jimevans: (at least you only write it once if you know what you're doing)
[2014-08-28 06:45:23] ato: window.open(url, name) should have an equivalent in WebDriver I think.
[2014-08-28 06:45:25] jimevans: ato: i can understand that argument.
[2014-08-28 06:45:42] jimevans: i may not specifically agree with it, but i can understand it.
[2014-08-28 06:45:54] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Drivers do something like that internally.
[2014-08-28 06:46:07] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Only without activating focus.
[2014-08-28 06:46:10] WhereIsMySpoon: ok...then why remove the convenience?
[2014-08-28 06:46:26] WhereIsMySpoon: you're only adding LoC overall in the world :)
[2014-08-28 06:46:34] jimevans: because i don't agree that it's convenient.
[2014-08-28 06:46:39] jimevans: but whatever.
[2014-08-28 06:46:43] WhereIsMySpoon: how is it not convenient?
[2014-08-28 06:46:46] WhereIsMySpoon: serious question
[2014-08-28 06:46:48] jimevans: i know i'm on the losing side of the argument
[2014-08-28 06:47:05] jimevans: it makes the api unclear
[2014-08-28 06:47:19] WhereIsMySpoon: how so?
[2014-08-28 06:47:22] ato: An argument for removing it is  that it's superfluous.
[2014-08-28 06:47:27] jimevans: the signature is driver.switchTo().window(String)
[2014-08-28 06:47:34] jimevans: the string arg can have multiple meanings.
[2014-08-28 06:47:38] jimevans: it's ambiguous
[2014-08-28 06:47:38] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2014-08-28 06:47:40] ato: Yes.
[2014-08-28 06:47:54] jimevans: thus, unclear.
[2014-08-28 06:47:56] WhereIsMySpoon: it's well documented though
[2014-08-28 06:48:02] WhereIsMySpoon: even the param name is windowNameOrHandle
[2014-08-28 06:48:04] jimevans: don't care. it's inelegant
[2014-08-28 06:48:17] WhereIsMySpoon: so you'd rather shove that inelgancy off to other people's code?
[2014-08-28 06:48:19] ato: But there needs to be some shared terminology between the DOM and WD.
[2014-08-28 06:48:21] barancev: well documented != clear
[2014-08-28 06:48:22] WhereIsMySpoon: elegancy*
[2014-08-28 06:48:33] WhereIsMySpoon: *inelegancy
[2014-08-28 06:48:33] ato: I wonder if we can make it clearer though.
[2014-08-28 06:48:41] ato: The switch functions.
[2014-08-28 06:48:56] jimevans: i'd be in favor of writing a method in the support library to duplicate the functionality.
[2014-08-28 06:49:17] jimevans: but yeah, push inelegancy on to others' code.
[2014-08-28 06:49:21] WhereIsMySpoon: :|
[2014-08-28 06:49:24] ato: Interesting thought.
[2014-08-28 06:49:37] ato: I think I'd be -1 though.
[2014-08-28 06:49:39] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see any reason to push inelegancy/bad coding styles onto other people
[2014-08-28 06:49:47] jimevans: there's already a "window switcher" in the .NET bindings.
[2014-08-28 06:49:59] WhereIsMySpoon: espeically if it involves extra effort on your part
[2014-08-28 06:50:07] jimevans: which is designed to return the handle of the newly opened window.
[2014-08-28 06:50:11] losh, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-28 06:50:12] ato: Because the window handle concept is a WD idiosyncracy.
[2014-08-28 06:50:16] jimevans: i dunno how many people use it
[2014-08-28 06:50:31] ato: And doesn't map well (at all actually) to the DOM.
[2014-08-28 06:50:34] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case
[2014-08-28 06:50:41] WhereIsMySpoon: move that stuff to a support class
[2014-08-28 06:50:48] jimevans: ato: you have to have some way of identifying windows.
[2014-08-28 06:50:48] WhereIsMySpoon: and keep the window name swithcing in webdriver
[2014-08-28 06:50:54] WhereIsMySpoon: switching*
[2014-08-28 06:51:04] WhereIsMySpoon: that makes much more sense to me
[2014-08-28 06:51:06] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: what?
[2014-08-28 06:51:20] jimevans: move what to a support class?
[2014-08-28 06:51:23] WhereIsMySpoon: window name switching is part of the DOM, and webdriver should map to the DOM
[2014-08-28 06:51:27] WhereIsMySpoon: or how the DOM behaves
[2014-08-28 06:51:27] WhereIsMySpoon: right?
[2014-08-28 06:51:52] jimevans: i don't grant that premise, no.
[2014-08-28 06:51:54] WhereIsMySpoon: if window handles are specific to webdriver/selenium, should they not be a better candidate to be separated out than the window name swithcing
[2014-08-28 06:52:13] jimevans: no, i completely disagree.
[2014-08-28 06:52:16] WhereIsMySpoon: clearly im in talk like mike tyson mode today
[2014-08-28 06:52:26] *ato is about to board a plane'
[2014-08-28 06:52:46] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont actually have any use at all for switching by widnow handle, other than when I cant switch by window name because of some reason
[2014-08-28 06:53:01] ato: jimevans: Just checking: You're not flying, right? (-;
[2014-08-28 06:53:01] WhereIsMySpoon: its pretty useless
[2014-08-28 06:53:12] jimevans: i'm not. not today anyway.
[2014-08-28 06:53:21] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-28 06:53:30] jimevans: i'm tempting the flying gods, since simonstewart is on my flight LHR-BLR.
[2014-08-28 06:53:31] jimevans: :)
[2014-08-28 06:53:45] ato: Haha.
[2014-08-28 06:53:47] jimevans: as long as you can open a window with window.open() that does not have a name parameter, you *must* have some way to identify and switch to that window.
[2014-08-28 06:53:59] ato: Lucky I'm flying with LH out of FRA.
[2014-08-28 06:54:02] WhereIsMySpoon: yes, but that is really only useful to the selenium internals
[2014-08-28 06:54:06] WhereIsMySpoon: and not to the users of selenium
[2014-08-28 06:54:21] jimevans: no, it really isn't just useful to internals of a driver.
[2014-08-28 06:54:30] WhereIsMySpoon: all you end up doing is iterating over the window handles and choosing the one that isnt the main handle
[2014-08-28 06:54:40] WhereIsMySpoon: and god help you if yo uhave more than 2 windows open
[2014-08-28 06:55:13] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: the code really isn't that hard to wrap one's head around.
[2014-08-28 06:55:24] ato: So the ordering of windows in DOM is UA specific.
[2014-08-28 06:55:24] jimevans: and again, you write it *once*.
[2014-08-28 06:55:29] WhereIsMySpoon: no, but it's ugly
[2014-08-28 06:55:35] ato: Another way of saying it's unspecified.
[2014-08-28 06:56:10] jimevans: now, one thing i *could* get behind is mandating that drivers maintain order of windows (in the order opened) in the window handle list.
[2014-08-28 06:56:26] barancev: are windows names unique?
[2014-08-28 06:56:30] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2014-08-28 06:56:32] jimevans: not necessarily
[2014-08-28 06:56:32] barancev: handles are
[2014-08-28 06:56:32] WhereIsMySpoon: wait, yes
[2014-08-28 06:56:38] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant open new windows with the same name
[2014-08-28 06:56:44] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt work
[2014-08-28 06:56:45] WhereIsMySpoon: iirc

[2014-08-28 06:57:07] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-28 06:57:29] barancev: what if I open a window without explicitly set name?
[2014-08-28 06:57:37] jimevans: i could easily make the case that forced-ordering of window handles is more useful than names *or* handles.
[2014-08-28 06:57:56] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: still not more useful than names
[2014-08-28 06:58:02] jimevans: entirely disagree.
[2014-08-28 06:58:06] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-08-28 06:58:11] simonstewart: jimevans: I tend to have pretty luck on flights. So far.
[2014-08-28 06:58:12] WhereIsMySpoon: unfortuante
[2014-08-28 06:58:30] ato: Forcing the naming is even worse I think.
[2014-08-28 06:58:42] ato: Sorry, forcing the sorting.
[2014-08-28 06:58:47] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd rather go driver.switchTo().window("name") than driver.switchTo().window(driver.getWindowHandles().get(2))
[2014-08-28 06:58:55] WhereIsMySpoon: or whatever index i wanted
[2014-08-28 06:59:10] simonstewart: The ordering of the handles isn’t guaranteed
[2014-08-28 06:59:12] WhereIsMySpoon: plus, what if I closed a window
[2014-08-28 06:59:14] ato: Ordering /isn't/ guaranteed.
[2014-08-28 06:59:19] jimevans: no, it isn't
[2014-08-28 06:59:21] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: thats what we're discussing
[2014-08-28 06:59:25] WhereIsMySpoon: that it could be
[2014-08-28 06:59:27] jimevans: simonstewart: it isn't guaranteed.
[2014-08-28 06:59:32] simonstewart: It would be meaningless
[2014-08-28 06:59:45] simonstewart: What would you order on?
[2014-08-28 06:59:48] jimevans: i'm saying i could make a case that ordered window handles makes more sense than names
[2014-08-28 06:59:50] WhereIsMySpoon: open order
[2014-08-28 06:59:53] jimevans: order of open in the session.
[2014-08-28 06:59:56] WhereIsMySpoon: but that doesnt really work
[2014-08-28 06:59:59] WhereIsMySpoon: cause if you close one, then what
[2014-08-28 07:00:06] WhereIsMySpoon: or close several
[2014-08-28 07:00:12] simonstewart: Open order? What if I open a window that opens two more, and they open two more?
[2014-08-28 07:00:18] simonstewart: What would your expected ordering be?
[2014-08-28 07:00:20] WhereIsMySpoon: or that ^
[2014-08-28 07:00:21] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: then they're removed from the list. whatever's left is still in the order they were opened.
[2014-08-28 07:00:27] ato: I think we should transpose the way windows are handled in the DOM because its familiar, even if it means we need a special way to label them.
[2014-08-28 07:00:39] simonstewart: In the example I gave, the ordering is non-deterministic
[2014-08-28 07:00:41] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: how -are- windows handled in the dom?
[2014-08-28 07:01:09] ato: Unspecified. Meaning Fx and IE does two different things.
[2014-08-28 07:01:09] simonstewart: Stable once opened, but non-deterministic a priori
[2014-08-28 07:01:15] ato: Yes.
[2014-08-28 07:01:19] jimevans: simonstewart: and you're then no worse off than if you had to iterate over handles to find the one you're looking for.
[2014-08-28 07:01:20] WhereIsMySpoon: I see
[2014-08-28 07:01:28] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: yes you are, if you remove window name switching
[2014-08-28 07:01:35] simonstewart: jimevans: exactly.
[2014-08-28 07:01:37] ato: Anyways. My flight is boarding.
[2014-08-28 07:01:39] WhereIsMySpoon: if I have window name switching, I have a deterministic way of switching
[2014-08-28 07:01:43] simonstewart: ato: toodle pip!
[2014-08-28 07:01:54] WhereIsMySpoon: as deterministic as any other locator method in selenium anyway
[2014-08-28 07:01:55] jimevans: ato: safe travels! see you next week.
[2014-08-28 07:01:56] simonstewart: But not all windows have names
[2014-08-28 07:02:06] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Do raise an issue in the W3C bugzilla if you want us to discuss it though.

[2014-08-28 07:02:47] simonstewart: It would be better to ask for a stable ordering that a deterministic one
[2014-08-28 07:03:00] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: what does "stable" mean
[2014-08-28 07:03:04] WhereIsMySpoon: in this context
[2014-08-28 07:03:15] jimevans: that's the tough question to answer, isn't it?
[2014-08-28 07:03:25] simonstewart: That multiple requests to “getWindowHandles” returns the handles in the same order each time
[2014-08-28 07:03:26] barancev: getWindowHandles method returns a Set<String>
[2014-08-28 07:03:46] simonstewart: Right now, the spec is welcome to return an unstable ordering for each call
[2014-08-28 07:03:51] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: why would that be useful?
[2014-08-28 07:04:07] WhereIsMySpoon: seen as you dont know what the order is, you cant rely on it
[2014-08-28 07:04:29] simonstewart: It means you can rely on “getWindowHandles()[1]” returning the same value on two calls provided no other windows are opened or closed
[2014-08-28 07:04:44] simonstewart: Which you can’t currently do
[2014-08-28 07:05:00] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont see what that would achieve/improve
[2014-08-28 07:05:06] simonstewart: Though I think that most of the implementations will do what you expect
[2014-08-28 07:05:19] simonstewart: Then there’s no point in attempting stable ordering, then :)
[2014-08-28 07:05:23] simonstewart: I’m okay with that
[2014-08-28 07:05:27] WhereIsMySpoon: im being serious

[2014-08-28 07:05:36] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused about how or what that wouild help
[2014-08-28 07:05:41] WhereIsMySpoon: not trying to be annoying or pick
[2014-08-28 07:05:42] WhereIsMySpoon: y
[2014-08-28 07:05:57] simonstewart: :)
[2014-08-28 07:06:04] WhereIsMySpoon: if I want a stable set, I assign it to a variable and use the variable
[2014-08-28 07:06:27] simonstewart: Which is the right way to handle it
[2014-08-28 07:06:40] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd do it that way even if it was stable
[2014-08-28 07:06:49] simonstewart: But a less thoughtful approach would be to call “getWindowHandles” whenever you need that set
[2014-08-28 07:06:52] WhereIsMySpoon: writing 'handles' is shorter than writing driver.getWindowHandles()
[2014-08-28 07:06:58] simonstewart: Ha!
[2014-08-28 07:07:10] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-28 07:07:25] WhereIsMySpoon: anyway, if you wanted a stable set
[2014-08-28 07:07:31] WhereIsMySpoon: you'd have to decide how to order it so it was stable
[2014-08-28 07:07:38] WhereIsMySpoon: which puts you back to where we were before..
[2014-08-28 07:08:40] WhereIsMySpoon: unless you have a static state of window handles in webdriver
[2014-08-28 07:08:50] WhereIsMySpoon: which seems like an awful lot of effort for nor eason
[2014-08-28 07:08:51] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2014-08-28 07:10:06] simonstewart: True.
[2014-08-28 07:10:26] simonstewart: Ordered is a special case of stable
[2014-08-28 07:11:24] simonstewart: If you don’t think that a stable ordering is feasible, then it follows you don’t believe that ordering by “opened time” or similar is feasible either
[2014-08-28 07:11:44] WhereIsMySpoon: indeed
[2014-08-28 07:11:55] WhereIsMySpoon: well...a stable ordering is feasible
[2014-08-28 07:12:11] WhereIsMySpoon: if you keep a static state of window handles, and always order it alphabetically for example
[2014-08-28 07:12:26] WhereIsMySpoon: when you open new windows, those window handles get inserted into the ordered list
[2014-08-28 07:12:33] simonstewart: So, type erasure in Java isn’t complete. I’m starting to believe it’s possible to tell whether a method has varargs or not from the byte code too.
[2014-08-28 07:12:37] simonstewart: Mind blown
[2014-08-28 07:12:46] WhereIsMySpoon: and so getWindowHandles always returns an a-z ordered list of handles
[2014-08-28 07:13:20] WhereIsMySpoon: but again, this is not very useful :p

[2014-08-28 07:13:31] simonstewart: z ordered, eh? Who picks the z ordering? The OS, the Window Manager or the browser?

[2014-08-28 07:14:03] WhereIsMySpoon: i was lazy
[2014-08-28 07:14:20] simonstewart: Ah. A-Z ordering of the window handles?
[2014-08-28 07:14:31] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, then it's a stable order
[2014-08-28 07:15:01] simonstewart: Might as well do that local end
[2014-08-28 07:15:29] WhereIsMySpoon: you were the one asking for a stable ordering of handles :p
[2014-08-28 07:16:09] dale_fukami, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-28 07:17:48] simonstewart: Ha :)
[2014-08-28 07:17:50] jimevans: let me be very clear. stating that window handles are "useless" isn't constructive.
[2014-08-28 07:17:59] jimevans: they're *not* useless.
[2014-08-28 07:18:11] jimevans: they fit a very specific use case for which there is no other alternative.
[2014-08-28 07:18:17] jimevans: and likely no other possible alternative.
[2014-08-28 07:18:47] WhereIsMySpoon: Sure
[2014-08-28 07:18:50] jimevans: as long as the name arg on window.open() is optional, the webdriver "window handle" concept is not useless.
[2014-08-28 07:18:58] WhereIsMySpoon: However, they are much -more- fiddly and annoying than switching to window names
[2014-08-28 07:19:19] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore I think that removing that functionality is a negative QoL change
[2014-08-28 07:19:32] jimevans: what percentage of sites using window.open() do you suppose actually use the name parameter?
[2014-08-28 07:19:47] WhereIsMySpoon: almost all of our windows do, because I made sure of it
[2014-08-28 07:19:57] jimevans: *yours*. operative word.
[2014-08-28 07:19:59] WhereIsMySpoon: Im one of the rare automated testers that has full code access
[2014-08-28 07:19:59] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-28 07:20:19] WhereIsMySpoon: Or rather, Im a full time dev that does automated testing
[2014-08-28 07:20:45] jimevans: bully for you. i don't have the luxury of catering to that case.
[2014-08-28 07:21:16] WhereIsMySpoon: In any case, I don't see why you'd want to invest effort in producing -QoL on a product
[2014-08-28 07:21:26] WhereIsMySpoon: When you could put that effort somewhere else to have a +QoL
[2014-08-28 07:21:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or +functionality
[2014-08-28 07:21:33] WhereIsMySpoon: or whatever
[2014-08-28 07:21:43] Dave_B_: most people I know using this don't have any direct code access, can only make requests that may be ignored
[2014-08-28 07:21:50] Dave_B_: including me
[2014-08-28 07:22:36] jimevans: i never said it was a serious consideration, to remove switching windows by name. but overloading the switchTo().window() method with an argument that can mean multiple things doesn't smell right for an api, to me.
[2014-08-28 07:22:50] SitamJana, quitting. (Quit: SitamJana)
[2014-08-28 07:22:58] WhereIsMySpoon: Right
[2014-08-28 07:23:02] WhereIsMySpoon: that I could agree with :)
[2014-08-28 07:23:17] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe have switchTo().windowHandle and switchTo().windowName

[2014-08-28 07:23:56] jimevans: and if i have to choose between "name" or "window handle", i'll take the latter every day and twice on sunday. if for no other reason than to allow for the case (which i believe to be vastly popular) where the window.open() call omits the name parameter.
[2014-08-28 07:24:30] jimevans: because i can write my own "switch to window by name" routine, if i have to. you can't go the other way 'round.
[2014-08-28 07:25:26] WhereIsMySpoon: Sure, but both already exist :)
[2014-08-28 07:25:34] WhereIsMySpoon: And are not mutually exclusive
[2014-08-28 07:26:59] jimevans: i guess i just don't have a terrible aversion to writing a 7 line method to switch to a window using something other than the window handle. especially when i can put that into a library, and never, ever, ever have to write it again.
[2014-08-28 07:27:34] WhereIsMySpoon: the point is that that method doesnt work for >2 windows

[2014-08-28 07:27:44] jimevans: since when?!?!?!
[2014-08-28 07:27:52] jimevans: it most certainly will!!!
[2014-08-28 07:28:12] jimevans: want me to prove it?
[2014-08-28 07:28:13] WhereIsMySpoon: I have one window open. I have a button that will open 2 windows
[2014-08-28 07:28:16] WhereIsMySpoon: Now what
[2014-08-28 07:28:22] WhereIsMySpoon: I have no clue which is the correct one
[2014-08-28 07:28:32] jimevans: wait one second. i'll gin up a :gist.

[2014-08-28 07:29:12] WhereIsMySpoon: so I then have to iterate over all window handles, maybe one or more have frames, so have to switch to them (or not) as well, and see whether an element is loaded on each page
[2014-08-28 07:29:42] WhereIsMySpoon: kinda a lot slower than switching to a window name :)
[2014-08-28 07:30:00] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that's a microoptimization, and i think you know that.

[2014-08-28 07:32:41] jimevans: will work fine no matter how many windows are open
[2014-08-28 07:32:58] jimevans: (and yeah, it's more than 7 lines. i made it verbose on purpose)
[2014-08-28 07:33:29] jimevans: that's c#, but the java would look very very similar.
[2014-08-28 07:33:46] WhereIsMySpoon: you can window.open without a url
[2014-08-28 07:34:07] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, but that's just an example.
[2014-08-28 07:34:15] jimevans: you want me to redo it with window.name?
[2014-08-28 07:34:28] jimevans: or that the title of the window is a given string?
[2014-08-28 07:34:38] jimevans: or that a given element exists on the page?
[2014-08-28 07:34:38] WhereIsMySpoon: ???? why would you do this with window.name
[2014-08-28 07:34:44] WhereIsMySpoon: you can switch dirtectly to the name
[2014-08-28 07:34:45] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-08-28 07:34:47] jimevans: you're missing my point entirely.
[2014-08-28 07:34:52] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: i just mentioned above the element way to do it
[2014-08-28 07:35:17] jimevans: either you're being deliberately obtuse, or we're talking past each other.
[2014-08-28 07:35:30] WhereIsMySpoon: my point is all these ways are longer and more complex than simply switching to a window name
[2014-08-28 07:35:33] jimevans: the point is that you can switch on *any* criteria
[2014-08-28 07:35:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i know, sometimes you cant
[2014-08-28 07:35:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that doesnt mean you should remove it

[2014-08-28 07:37:49] jimevans: it's not a guilt card. i've been doing this a long time. likely longer than you've been alive. so get off my lawn! :)
[2014-08-28 07:37:49] WhereIsMySpoon: you can have a debate without anyone "winning"
[2014-08-28 07:38:44] jimevans: and you can also have a debate without demeaning a design choice as "useless"
[2014-08-28 07:38:51] jimevans: (which, incidentally, is why i got a bit riled)
[2014-08-28 07:39:05] WhereIsMySpoon: it's just a little bit annoying to have a big debate then to have the other person brush off everything of value by saying "actually, I'm probably an idiot, you win"
[2014-08-28 07:39:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ok so I probably made a mistake by saying that
[2014-08-28 07:39:30] WhereIsMySpoon: It is useless to a selenium user as long as you have a window name to switch to
[2014-08-28 07:39:36] WhereIsMySpoon: if you don't, it isn't

[2014-08-28 07:42:17] jimevans: i get enough crap from myself about how shitty my code and design choices are. i don't need other people piling on. :)
[2014-08-28 07:42:50] WhereIsMySpoon: I think it was more a kneejerk reaction from you saying that you wanted to remove it more than anything
