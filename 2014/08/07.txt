[2014-08-07 01:18:56] andy_seit: Hey guys.  I just had a response from Sauce that said Selendroid can't be used for mobile web automation, only hybrid native apps.  I've done extremely little mobile web automation, but I thought Selendroid could be used for both.

[2014-08-07 03:48:06] WhereIsMySpoon: what the heck is a link o.o
[2014-08-07 03:48:08] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: what language is this
[2014-08-07 03:48:13] andcie: java
[2014-08-07 03:48:43] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: and you're trying to click the <a ng-click .... element?
[2014-08-07 03:48:54] andcie: yes
[2014-08-07 03:49:12] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: ok so Link is not a class in the webdriver bindings afaik
[2014-08-07 03:49:32] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: you have a WebDriver object right?
[2014-08-07 03:50:26] andcie: yes
[2014-08-07 03:50:41] andcie: i will send you all path from inspect element
[2014-08-07 03:50:43] andcie: 1 sec
[2014-08-07 03:50:45] andcie: ;)
[2014-08-07 03:51:34] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: ok so to get that element, you could do driver.getElement(By.xpath("//a[@ng-click=selectTab('summary')]"))
[2014-08-07 03:52:01] WhereIsMySpoon: that will select any <a> elements that have the ng-click attribute that equals "selectTab('summary')"
[2014-08-07 03:52:03] andcie: <li ng-class="{active: !profile.summaryActive}"><a ng-click="selectTab('timeline')"><span><span class="svgi icon-timeline-view"></span>

[2014-08-07 03:52:49] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: this would be a lot easier if you could put an id on that <a> element
[2014-08-07 03:52:55] Abhyuday, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-08-07 03:53:04] WhereIsMySpoon: then you can just do driver.findElement(By.id("someid"))
[2014-08-07 03:54:15] WhereIsMySpoon: andcie: the normal object to use for any element is WebElement object
[2014-08-07 03:54:23] WhereIsMySpoon: for <select> you use the special one Select
[2014-08-07 03:54:23] andcie: well yes, but sometimes it doesn't have the id
[2014-08-07 03:54:29] andcie: and the I have problem
[2014-08-07 03:54:31] WhereIsMySpoon: just an fyi
[2014-08-07 03:54:40] WhereIsMySpoon: yes so then you use css selector or xpath
[2014-08-07 03:54:48] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont know any css selector for ng-click
[2014-08-07 03:54:51] WhereIsMySpoon: so I gave u an xpath
[2014-08-07 03:54:59] WhereIsMySpoon: driver.getElement(By.xpath("//a[@ng-click=selectTab('summary')]"))
[2014-08-07 03:55:13] WhereIsMySpoon: if you have any other <a> elements that have the same ng-click though, it wont really work
[2014-08-07 03:55:31] WhereIsMySpoon: so you'd want to specify some parent elements path

[2014-08-07 04:33:58] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: yes but you will have to use a headless driver which are notoriously buggy or out of date
[2014-08-07 04:34:01] andcie: you mean selnium 1? and check logs?

[2014-08-07 04:37:36] Lope: without doing reloads.
[2014-08-07 04:37:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: and hte purpose of this is?
[2014-08-07 04:38:22] Lope: because if the browser gets torn down every time it's gonna need to load the html and css and yada yada every time. but if it idles then it can just sit there receiving JSON updates. and I can read those updates.
[2014-08-07 04:38:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: the purpose of it idling there and looking at the page is?
[2014-08-07 04:38:51] WhereIsMySpoon: what are you trying to achieve
[2014-08-07 04:38:57] Lope: I need to write some test software to make sure that browsers can idle on a site and receive up-to date information.
[2014-08-07 04:39:02] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-08-07 04:39:21] Lope: so I'll be comparing what's in the browser with the source.
[2014-08-07 04:39:42] WhereIsMySpoon: im going to be skeptical if selenium can achieve this in a way that would be helpful
[2014-08-07 04:39:52] Lope: Are there nice alternatives?
[2014-08-07 04:39:57] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium tests usually look for dom changes
[2014-08-07 04:40:05] WhereIsMySpoon: not a clue tbh
[2014-08-07 04:40:10] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry
[2014-08-07 04:40:12] Lope: I used to use internet explorer for this kind of stuff. back when I was a windows drone.
[2014-08-07 04:40:24] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: ask here in 2-3 hours again maybe someone will have an idea
[2014-08-07 04:40:28] Lope: but now I'm free and more enlightened. I'd like to achieve my goals with penguin stuff.
[2014-08-07 04:40:29] WhereIsMySpoon: more ppl are on then
[2014-08-07 04:41:16] Lope: It was my understanding that you just fire up selenium, connect to a port and give it instructions or read the DOM etc?
[2014-08-07 04:41:26] Lope: so why would there be a problem with idling?
[2014-08-07 04:41:32] WhereIsMySpoon: there is no problem with idling
[2014-08-07 04:41:37] WhereIsMySpoon: the problem is with testing what has changed
[2014-08-07 04:41:45] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium primarily tests dom changes
[2014-08-07 04:43:11] Lope: well as long as I can send an instruction to read the dom every minute, it's fine?
[2014-08-07 04:43:20] WhereIsMySpoon: you can do WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get("http://mypage.com"); while(true) {} and it will run forever on that page
[2014-08-07 04:43:30] Lope: I wonder if it'll be nicer to use nodejs or php
[2014-08-07 04:43:51] Lope: what language is that, where would that code be?
[2014-08-07 04:43:52] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: the problem is not with reading the dom or idling or anything, it's with what you *actually* want it to test
[2014-08-07 04:43:57] WhereIsMySpoon: thats java
[2014-08-07 04:44:03] WhereIsMySpoon: for example
[2014-08-07 04:44:21] Lope: well I'll just pull the data from the DOM into my controlling software, and do my tests on it there?
[2014-08-07 04:44:23] WhereIsMySpoon: say I click an <a> element which has an onclick="javascript:showASpanElement()"
[2014-08-07 04:44:38] WhereIsMySpoon: I would then do a small webdriverwait to wait until teh span element appeared
[2014-08-07 04:44:50] Lope: oh yeah

[2014-08-07 04:45:30] WhereIsMySpoon: with yours, there is not any particular dom change unless im missing something
[2014-08-07 04:45:37] WhereIsMySpoon: if there is, please enlighten me
[2014-08-07 04:45:48] WhereIsMySpoon: its difficult to help you if I dont have the page you're talking abuot
[2014-08-07 04:45:53] WhereIsMySpoon: or a clue of exactly wahts happening
[2014-08-07 04:54:50] Dave_B_: you could poll at whatever interval and use the answers to base tests on, but it'll have a lot of potential to be flakey if you're not able to be sure when the updates happen or whatever
[2014-08-07 04:55:17] Dave_B_: without a clear sign to wait for it could be confusing

[2014-08-07 07:30:21] andy_seit: Yeah, I might have been confusing in my description, I've a hell of a headache today.  I meant that I'd like Sauce to use Selendroid & ios-Driver, but it looks like they're using  org.openqa.selenium.iphone.IPhoneDriver & AndroidDriver.  And their support told me Selendroid didn't support mobile web, only hybrid apps.

[2014-08-07 10:08:52] lukeis: yep
[2014-08-07 10:09:05] lukeis: but i don't think it's getting in the spec

[2014-08-07 10:09:30] wilhelm_: Feel free to spec it, and we'll shove it into level 2.
[2014-08-07 10:09:50] AutomatedTester: storage === ?

[2014-08-07 10:10:42] jleyba: i think the java bindings still have an api for websql too
[2014-08-07 10:10:54] AutomatedTester: websql wont make it into the webdriver spec
[2014-08-07 10:10:57] AutomatedTester: just saying
[2014-08-07 10:11:07] jleyba: was commenting more that we should remove that
[2014-08-07 10:11:11] jleyba: websql is a dead spec anyway
[2014-08-07 10:11:29] AutomatedTester: well... my employer helped that iirc
[2014-08-07 10:11:37] jleyba: helped kill it or define it?

[2014-08-07 10:11:44] wilhelm_: AutomatedTester: localStorage should be available, ideally.

[2014-08-07 10:12:02] AutomatedTester: wilhelm_: ok... what about ServiceWorkers?
[2014-08-07 10:12:09] AutomatedTester: and appcache
[2014-08-07 10:12:13] jleyba: no complaints here. killing websql is very justifiable since everyone was just using sqlite

[2014-08-07 15:09:28] rebelagentm: Thanks!  No worries.  One of my colleagues was seeing some weirdness with FF31, and a quick Google search revealed some similar issues.
[2014-08-07 15:09:38] rebelagentm: Figured the new version may not be supported yet
[2014-08-07 15:10:08] AutomatedTester: rebelagentm: its supported except for native events
[2014-08-07 15:10:17] AutomatedTester: that requires certain bits to be recompiled
[2014-08-07 15:10:34] rebelagentm: Gotcha.  Thanks for the heads up!
