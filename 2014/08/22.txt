[2014-08-22 02:35:04] Neo--: or can we conclude that DnD of file is browser thing that doesn't need to be tested?
[2014-08-22 02:36:47] WhereIsMySpoon: Neo--: selenium is not for interacting with the operating system
[2014-08-22 02:36:53] WhereIsMySpoon: it is for interacting with the browser
[2014-08-22 02:39:23] Neo--: yeah I know that :)
[2014-08-22 02:39:41] Neo--: I thought you could somehow specify file and DnD it where you want it
[2014-08-22 02:39:57] Neo--: but since that is a form input element anyway, this is browser domain anyhow
[2014-08-22 02:43:51] WhereIsMySpoon: Neo--: if you want to specify a file to put in your <input type="file"> you can do sendKeys to the input element
[2014-08-22 02:44:04] Neo--: yup

[2014-08-22 07:23:24] jimevans: so simonstewart, AutomatedTester and i had a fun discussion about requiring vendor-provided httpds the other day.
[2014-08-22 07:23:40] jimevans: (he's anti, i'm pro)
[2014-08-22 07:24:34] simonstewart: I’m anti MUST and pro SHOULD
[2014-08-22 07:24:43] simonstewart: Hang on.
[2014-08-22 07:24:51] simonstewart: httpds == HTTP over SSL
[2014-08-22 07:25:00] simonstewart: Or that vendors should always supply their own HTTPD?
[2014-08-22 07:25:01] jimevans: no, http implementation
[2014-08-22 07:25:05] jimevans: the latter.
[2014-08-22 07:25:36] simonstewart: The spec is really clear: they need to provide an implementation of the remote wire protocol remote end
[2014-08-22 07:26:12] simonstewart: Cos that’s how interop works
[2014-08-22 07:26:17] jimevans: his argument is a good one, that the UX of having to download stuff from multiple places to get it to work is not great.
[2014-08-22 07:26:18] simonstewart: Cos otherwise the spec ain’t wortgh shit
[2014-08-22 07:26:41] simonstewart: Perhaps, but the vendor still needs to supply the bits
[2014-08-22 07:27:01] simonstewart: I could imagine Mozilla saying “we provide it through this package” or whatever
[2014-08-22 07:27:07] cgoldberg, quitting. (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[2014-08-22 07:27:20] simonstewart: But just handing over the local end isn’t going to help anyone, unless they’re using the language mozilla choose to offer
[2014-08-22 07:27:24] jimevans: "here's the selenium language bindings, now you're ready to go. except, no wait, go here for a driver for chrome, and here for one for IE, and here for one for firefox, and if you want mobile, you need to go all these other places."
[2014-08-22 07:28:27] simonstewart: “Here are the language bindings. If you’d like to test with a particular browser, the vendor supplies their httpd this way"
[2014-08-22 07:28:35] jimevans: fwiw, i've been playing about with a common remote-end http framework that's cross-platform and extensible.
[2014-08-22 07:28:46] simonstewart: “But, if you’re feeling lazy, here’s the selenium project. It’ll give you the popular ones already bundled up"
[2014-08-22 07:28:56] simonstewart: +1
[2014-08-22 07:29:15] simonstewart: Was talking to someone the other day who was thinking of writing a remote end
[2014-08-22 07:29:18] jimevans: also that compiles to native code, so you don't need a specific "language runtime"
[2014-08-22 07:29:30] simonstewart: I told ‘em to use the work you’d done for the IeDriverServer and piggy back on that
[2014-08-22 07:29:43] girija, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-22 07:29:52] jimevans: yep. the http/json handling stuff is already factored out into its own directory.
[2014-08-22 07:30:08] jimevans: cf. /cpp/webdriver-server
[2014-08-22 07:31:32] jimevans: basically, you implement three methods in each of two subclasses, and you get a full remote-end server in c++.

[2014-08-22 07:32:11] Cerz: cgoldberg: not entirely sure what the meta key is doing. Been trying it with an assortment of keys, but it wasn't performing their shortcuts (if it was mapped to windows key). Might be using it wrong at the moment, but I'll keep trying and let you know if I find out what it is
[2014-08-22 07:32:48] Cerz: Although, saying that I might be using it wrong at the moment, I got CTRL+A and Alt+F working in the same way, so it should definitley be sending the key press
[2014-08-22 07:33:20] jimevans: it's not completely cross-platform yet because current implementation uses tr1's regex classes, and gcc has a notoriously incomplete/nonexistent implementation until 4.9. i've a patch i need to apply to rectify that, since regexes are a little heavyweight for what we're doing..

[2014-08-22 11:53:42] greggersh: anyway, I’m getting started with selenium-webdriver via rspec/capybara, and I’m using FF 29, and have the selenium-webdriver gem version 2.42.0.
[2014-08-22 11:53:47] greggersh: oh I need some help. ;)
[2014-08-22 11:54:28] greggersh: I see above it says version 2.42.2 is out, but I can’t get that gem version via bundler…
