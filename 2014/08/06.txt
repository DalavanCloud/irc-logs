[2014-08-06 10:45:24] andy_seit: (On IE10)
[2014-08-06 10:45:48] jimevans: andy_seit: yep. your document isn't finishing loading in IE.
[2014-08-06 10:48:46] andy_seit: Visually it looks like it's complete (and it only times out after 3min or so), but yeah that seems to be the case.  I'm assuming it's not a driver issue.  I only see this over sauce.  Over grid I don't think I've seen it at all.  I'm chasing it with their support but they've gone a bit quiet.
[2014-08-06 10:49:50] jimevans: it could well be a driver issue. the IE driver developer can't code his way out of a wet paper bag
[2014-08-06 10:50:19] lukeis: yeah, that guy is abysmal ;)
[2014-08-06 10:50:28] jimevans: but it could also be a resource the page is requesting not being downloaded properly. like analytics scripts or the like.

[2014-08-06 10:51:16] jimevans: i'm guessing he can't afford to. if this is the quality of his code, he'd have a tough time getting hired.

[2014-08-06 10:56:21] andy_seit: apparently signalr can cause it, but we don't use it

[2014-08-06 12:00:27] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-08-06 12:00:44] AutomatedTester: and the python code uses the parts we need
[2014-08-06 12:01:43] jimevans: the selenium "create a custom profile" code could probably use an overhaul. i know the .net version could. i'd like to use something as close to "officially sanctioned" as possible.

[2014-08-06 23:45:21] tenety: Hello, dear Community. Has anybody recently worked with LocalStorage manipulation in RemoteWebDriver. Just executing 'localStorage.clear()' script doesn't work now (though in old forum messages people told that it did). Does anybody kindly know any other solution?
