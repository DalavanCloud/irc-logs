The pages aren't really complicated enough to warrant it though (imo).  Just the intern trying to squeak some better test performance out of (ultimately) a shockingly slow search results page.

[2014-08-19 09:09:30] lukeis: if you want access, you can ping plightbo :)
[2014-08-19 09:09:38] barancev: so the instruction is partially correct, it should be uploaded to http://release.seleniumhq.org/

[2014-08-19 13:35:39] jleyba: owen1: use selenium to launch chrome

[2014-08-19 13:36:10] AutomatedTester: but the get() should be waiting for DOMContentLoaded event to fire which  should populate the performance.timings object

[2014-08-19 13:52:09] jleyba: you're telling the Selenium server you don't care what browser it starts
[2014-08-19 13:52:10] errant_rider: that internal div seems to break it

[2014-08-19 13:53:48] IJNX: jleyba ok, but when running in remote android emulator what should it be? If I put there crome it will start chrome locally instead of connecting to appium

[2014-08-19 13:55:11] jleyba: but browserName should never be empty
[2014-08-19 13:55:33] lukeis: jleyba: it's special… you don't need browserName with it in some situations
[2014-08-19 13:55:46] lukeis: like when you're running against an app
[2014-08-19 13:55:53] lukeis: browserName doesn't make sense
[2014-08-19 13:56:40] jleyba: oh well.. I tried
[2014-08-19 13:56:59] jimevans: errant_rider: so there must be some javascript happening somewhere on the page to respond to keystrokes.
[2014-08-19 13:57:05] jleyba: the logic for deciding what to start is probably the most fucked up part of our code base. too many fuzzy matches
[2014-08-19 13:57:12] errant_rider: jim i guess so
[2014-08-19 13:58:15] jimevans: so you're going to have to hack around that behavior. maybe send one keystroke, waiting for the new element to be created, then sending the next. i dunno. i'd have to actually debug the site/tests to give you something more concrete.
[2014-08-19 13:58:33] jimevans: and i have neither the time nor the inclination to do that at the moment. :)

[2014-08-19 17:26:31] dogarrhea: so selenium cross browser is totally impractical.
[2014-08-19 17:27:01] dogarrhea: each javascript library. each framework. everything renders html slightly different on all the browsers
[2014-08-19 17:27:31] dogarrhea: what point is there to automated testing if you only run it on 1 browser
[2014-08-19 17:27:33] dogarrhea: it's dumb.
[2014-08-19 17:28:38] dogarrhea: example: fine uploader, a jquery plugin. css is different on ie8 and ie9 and ie10.  opacity: 0 bugs.  inputs may or may not have type= attributes. it's totally useless to even attempt to automate cross browser

[2014-08-19 17:35:22] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-19 17:38:03] dogarrhea: it's definitely not worth the effort to maintain and debug tests to include a hacky workaround for each browser where the complexity of actual browser differences compounded upon browser differences in rendered html from the application itself creates 4 x complexity creates too much stupid busy work to support "multiple browser support"
[2014-08-19 17:39:17] dogarrhea: multiple browser support is basically a myth. Selenium doesn't have that feature. sorry
[2014-08-19 17:39:54] dogarrhea: maintaining potentially 1 copy of code for each browser is not multiple browser support at all. and there are situations where this is the only way to do it
[2014-08-19 17:43:37] dogarrhea: selenium is a dead end :(
