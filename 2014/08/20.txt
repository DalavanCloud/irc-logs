[2014-08-20 03:03:10] Lope: does selenium have issues with web-developer tool?
[2014-08-20 03:03:34] Lope: because it seems after I start inspecting elements with webdeveloper tool in chromium selenium can't find elements anymore etc.
[2014-08-20 03:04:18] Lope: wow, and in the same session, when I close web-developer tool it works again!

[2014-08-20 03:06:09] AutomatedTester:  and its my understanding it's non-trivial to fix
[2014-08-20 03:06:10] Lope: why doesn't selenium throw an error saying "You're using webdev tools so I'm not available" instead of the weird errors it throws?
[2014-08-20 03:06:32] AutomatedTester: Lope: thats a bug for the Chromium team
[2014-08-20 03:06:48] Lope: AutomatedTester: Ok. thanks. Wow I'm so glad I figured this out.
[2014-08-20 03:07:13] Lope: I was a bit distressed that selenium "seemed to stop working" after a while. haha because after a little while I'd open the webdev tools lol.

[2014-08-20 05:44:32] selbot2: ok!
[2014-08-20 05:45:03] ato: Maybe a client binding will give me the answer.

[2014-08-20 05:48:59] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-20 05:49:27] timg: Is it recommended/supported to have multiple tests run in a single browser session? It seems that everything I try results in a new browser window being opened for each test function
[2014-08-20 05:49:50] dimacus: timg: it depends if you are going for speed or reliability
[2014-08-20 05:50:09] dimacus: having a new browser per test is more reliable becuase it's new cache, new cookies new everything
[2014-08-20 05:50:25] andy_seit2, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2014-08-20 05:50:26] dimacus: but it adds up to 30 seconds or more per test, while the browser opens
[2014-08-20 05:50:49] timg: dimacus: I'm talking about basic tests.. 1) open the site, 2) log in, 3) perform a single function
[2014-08-20 05:51:04] WhereIsMySpoon: timg: you usually do all that in one test
[2014-08-20 05:51:27] dimacus: yeah that sounds like 1 test there
[2014-08-20 05:52:14] timg: ok I guess I'm confusing functional and unit testing, trying to keep each test specific to one thing
[2014-08-20 05:52:39] stan, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-08-20 05:52:41] dimacus: timg: common mistake, but typically you don't want to use selenium for "unit" testing
[2014-08-20 05:52:46] dimacus: bc it's too expensive
[2014-08-20 05:52:46] ato: Oh the Selenium wire protocol just doesn't make any sense.
[2014-08-20 05:52:47] timg: got it
[2014-08-20 05:52:49] timg: thanks alot
[2014-08-20 05:52:56] dimacus: timg: here is one last idea
[2014-08-20 05:53:13] ato: AutomatedTester: Have we fixed the endpoints for setting timeouts in the spec?
[2014-08-20 05:53:20] ato: AutomatedTester: They are very confusing in Selenium.
[2014-08-20 05:53:34] AutomatedTester: I cant remember
[2014-08-20 05:53:38] AutomatedTester: :spec

[2014-08-20 05:53:50] dimacus: timg: instead of testing 1 page with selenium, try to test a "process flow", something along the lines of "As a user, I should be able to add item to my cart, and go through checkout flow until I get a successful purchase"
[2014-08-20 05:54:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^^^^ this
[2014-08-20 05:54:27] WhereIsMySpoon: unit testing != selenium testing
[2014-08-20 05:54:36] WhereIsMySpoon: just because in java they both use junit doesnt mean they are the same
[2014-08-20 05:54:43] ato: AutomatedTester: Like you have POST /session/{id}/timeouts which accepts a dict of {"ms": n, "type": "a string"}, but then you can also do POST /session/{id}/timeouts/async_script.
[2014-08-20 05:54:43] dimacus: yup
[2014-08-20 05:54:51] ato: AutomatedTester: But then you can't do that for page load.
[2014-08-20 05:55:31] ato: I think this is us trying to be RESTish.
[2014-08-20 05:55:38] timg: dimacus, WhereIsMySpoon ok that's what I'll do.. thanks again
[2014-08-20 05:55:46] dimacus: np
[2014-08-20 05:55:47] WhereIsMySpoon: np
[2014-08-20 05:55:47] AutomatedTester: ato: where can you do POST /session/{id}/timeouts/async_script ? in the OSS project?
[2014-08-20 05:55:53] ato: But I think maybe an either/or solution would be clearer as the Selenium APIs are sort of confused at this point.
[2014-08-20 05:56:05] ato: Yeah, I'm just looking at Selenium here.
[2014-08-20 05:56:19] AutomatedTester: ato: at the last F2F people wanted a dictionary sent over the wire
[2014-08-20 05:56:26] AutomatedTester: well, thats how I remember it
[2014-08-20 05:56:28] ato: So just /timeouts with a dict?
[2014-08-20 05:56:36] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-08-20 05:56:45] ato: That answers my question.
[2014-08-20 05:56:48] ato: Also yay, that's much better.
[2014-08-20 05:57:08] AutomatedTester: POST 	/session/{sessionId}/timeouts with the data { type: "page load", ms: "123"}

[2014-08-20 05:57:32] ato: Do you know what the magic strings would be for async script and implicit wait?
[2014-08-20 05:58:03] AutomatedTester: in the spec I have "script" and "implicit"
[2014-08-20 05:58:09] ato: Great. (-:
[2014-08-20 05:58:17] AutomatedTester: happy to bikeshed on it if need be
[2014-08-20 05:58:28] ato: I think this makes perfect sense.
[2014-08-20 05:58:33] ato: And it's extendible.

[2014-08-20 07:44:56] AutomatedTester: so... this idea that users have to download httpd's from every single vendor... can we kill this idea yet?
[2014-08-20 07:47:18] ato: So I had an idea about that yesterday.
[2014-08-20 07:48:05] ato: What we need for Marionette is an httpd frontend, a URL endpoint to command translator, and a marshaler and unmarshaler for the Marionette protocol, right?
[2014-08-20 07:48:10] jimevans: AutomatedTester: it makes the language bindings code so very very much simpler.
[2014-08-20 07:48:53] jimevans: ato and i had quite the discussion about this yesterday.
[2014-08-20 07:49:45] ato: What if we reuse the work that jimevans has done on programming a webdriver httpd server (so we don't need to ship our own binary, it could be done by Selenium), and provide a shared binary library that it links in that does these three things?

[2014-08-20 07:51:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans: client bindings easier but a really really shitty UX for our users
[2014-08-20 07:51:58] AutomatedTester: ato: its not that there is a httpd, I dont care about that
[2014-08-20 07:52:14] ato: Could we potentially ship a single Selenium server binary with all drivers in it?
[2014-08-20 07:52:26] ato: Or IE + Firefox in this case.
[2014-08-20 07:52:33] jimevans: ato: that's easily doable.
[2014-08-20 07:52:34] AutomatedTester: our biggest complaints from users are the inability to get LATEST of each of the bindings
[2014-08-20 07:52:58] AutomatedTester: and then we say... run off to Chromium, MS and Mozilla and download these things
[2014-08-20 07:53:07] ato: Yup

[2014-08-20 07:57:23] AutomatedTester: jimevans: why can't make vendors supply a command executor
[2014-08-20 07:57:33] jimevans: AutomatedTester: but vendor-provided separate executables are, simply put, cleaner. it allows the vendor to control in a consistent way the things it needs to for setup/teardown of sessions (like writing a temp profile for firefox, or managing the iexplore.exe process lifetime for IE)
[2014-08-20 07:57:44] ato: So that was my initial plan, but the spec now mandates that implementations provide HTTP endpoints.
[2014-08-20 07:57:57] AutomatedTester: ato: this has always been my plan
[2014-08-20 07:58:19] jimevans: what technology do you want? having to specify a language runtime other than what the user is using simply moves the problem you're complaining about up one level.
[2014-08-20 07:58:28] ato: What the individual client APIs does internally I care less for.
[2014-08-20 07:58:54] neeti, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-08-20 07:59:02] ato: If they want to implement the Marionette protocol directly, they're of course perfectly welcome to do so.
[2014-08-20 07:59:09] ato: It's what Ruby and Python's been doing for years.
[2014-08-20 07:59:11] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you can't download a selenium httpd from pypi/nuget/maven/rubygems
[2014-08-20 07:59:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and there is no requirement from vendors to ship their httpd in a specific binary
[2014-08-20 07:59:57] ato: Doesn't the current situation solve the problem?
[2014-08-20 08:00:07] ato: Except for Chrome.
[2014-08-20 08:00:17] AutomatedTester: and IE
[2014-08-20 08:00:29] AutomatedTester: you can't tight bind to IE without a server
[2014-08-20 08:00:34] ato: Well that's only because no one has done the work yet.
[2014-08-20 08:00:46] ato: It's a lot of work to create executors for each browser for every language.
[2014-08-20 08:01:06] AutomatedTester: sure
[2014-08-20 08:01:18] ato: Less so for some drivers though (-;
[2014-08-20 08:01:35] WhereIsMySpoon: anyone got any ideas for my issue? =/ im stumped
[2014-08-20 08:01:47] AutomatedTester: but since there is no requirement for the httpd to be a binary we can ship what we want
[2014-08-20 08:02:07] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 819
[2014-08-20 08:02:11] ato: Well shipping an httpd which requires the Python runtime seems suboptimal.
[2014-08-20 08:02:32] AutomatedTester: if I decided tomorrow that mozilla would ship a node.js httpd for marionette no one can do anything about it
[2014-08-20 08:02:43] AutomatedTester: ato: its as suboptimal as forcing people to use java
[2014-08-20 08:02:53] ato: Indeed.
[2014-08-20 08:03:02] AutomatedTester: so that ship has sailed
[2014-08-20 08:03:10] ato: I'm missing your point.
[2014-08-20 08:03:40] AutomatedTester: we always said that we would do the hard work so our users wouldnt have to
[2014-08-20 08:04:11] AutomatedTester: I feel that forcing lots of downloads from multiple sources kills that idea
[2014-08-20 08:05:14] AutomatedTester: vendors are going to pick a language that they are proficient at and ship something in that language

[2014-08-20 08:14:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ideally MSFT would offer up Java CommandExecutor to the OSS project for those languages that don't want to do COM
[2014-08-20 08:15:22] AutomatedTester: and since they used to do a Java compilier I am sure there are one or two people there that can do a decent job
[2014-08-20 08:16:36] jimevans: i know i'm the squeaky wheel about external processes as the mechanism, and the standardization afforded by an httpd.
[2014-08-20 08:16:59] jimevans: i'm sensitive to the UX argument too.
[2014-08-20 08:17:46] jimevans: but i do believe it's a not-bad model to follow.
[2014-08-20 08:18:23] jimevans: look, i've created a firefox language binding, both for the current technology, and for marionett.
[2014-08-20 08:18:26] jimevans: marionette.
[2014-08-20 08:18:40] AutomatedTester: I have had companies like Bocoup tell me that the multiple downloads makes Selenium an unattractive option
[2014-08-20 08:19:55] jimevans: would the "unattractiveness" problem be resolved if we had a better packaging solution?
[2014-08-20 08:20:03] AutomatedTester: maybe
[2014-08-20 08:20:03] FlyingDog, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2014-08-20 08:20:06] AutomatedTester: a single download
[2014-08-20 08:20:15] AutomatedTester: or even have it part of package managers
[2014-08-20 08:20:28] AutomatedTester: e.g. nuget install selenium
[2014-08-20 08:20:35] AutomatedTester: that downloads ALL the httpds
[2014-08-20 08:21:03] AutomatedTester: in their example they want |npm install selenium| to do that

[2014-08-20 08:23:24] jimevans: *sigh* nuget wouldn't be that hard either, though i really dislike it for distributing executable binaries. there are even already unofficial packages that do exactly this for chrome and IE httpds
[2014-08-20 08:23:55] jimevans: i have no comment on npm, pypi, or maven, as i've little experience with them.
[2014-08-20 08:25:05] jimevans: i'm just not sure it's appropriate for the driver, as maintained by the vendor, to have to be beholden to the shipping schedule of the OSS project.
[2014-08-20 08:25:35] jimevans: hell, we can't get our act together to ship 2.43 for what, more than 12 weeks now?
[2014-08-20 08:25:38] Dave_B_: I liek it being separate
[2014-08-20 08:25:41] Dave_B_: *like
[2014-08-20 08:25:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: but then client bindings, since these are client binding package managers, will need to be updated everytime vendors release a new version
[2014-08-20 08:25:59] AutomatedTester: and when we get more vendors joining
[2014-08-20 08:26:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: these are engineering problems and there are solutions
[2014-08-20 08:26:42] jimevans: not necessarily, depending on the package manager.
[2014-08-20 08:27:43] jimevans: for some package manager, if you make the "selenium" package dependent on the, say, "chromedriver.exe" package where "[version == latest]", chromedriver updates, you get the update when dependencies are checked.
[2014-08-20 08:27:50] jleyba: I don’t think the Selenium project should be in the business of distributing vendor implementations

[2014-08-20 08:29:09] Dave_B_: I'd argue this being just an engineering problem - it's a perception problem in my eyes, and alters where people believe responsibility for different aspects lies. I don't like the idea of the drivers being distributed as part of the project in the slightest, either for the project or for the driver. It seems lose-lose to me.
[2014-08-20 08:30:00] jimevans: how many chrome-specific issues do we get in the issue tracker that get ported to the chromedriver issue tracker? it's not non-zero, and we don't even distribute the chromedriver executable.
[2014-08-20 08:30:22] jimevans: but you're right, there is an opportunity to improve the UX here.
[2014-08-20 08:30:27] jleyba: How do we decide what a vendor is that we’ll distribute?
[2014-08-20 08:30:53] jleyba: Only mega corporations need apply, or do we start distributing phantomjs and other open implementations?
[2014-08-20 08:31:05] ato: Dave_B_: The advantage of not having to replicate profile and binary management in every language is that there's a lower risk of language specific behaviour IMO.
[2014-08-20 08:31:10] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: any more ideas about my issue? Or not looked at it much? :)
[2014-08-20 08:31:16] jleyba: Do we become responsible for vetting executables for malware?

[2014-08-20 08:39:10] AutomatedTester: we dont distribute binaries

[2014-08-20 08:39:45] AutomatedTester: command_executor.py
[2014-08-20 08:39:58] jleyba: so what’s the problem?
[2014-08-20 08:40:25] AutomatedTester: having multiple downloads for each and every httpd for each vendor is bad UX for our users
[2014-08-20 08:40:51] AutomatedTester: was suggesting vendors supply the code to speak to their browser directly
[2014-08-20 08:41:08] AutomatedTester: in a command executor class
[2014-08-20 08:41:22] jleyba: good luck with that
[2014-08-20 08:41:31] jleyba: 1) vendors aren’t going to write code for every language binding
[2014-08-20 08:41:40] ato: Singling out specific languages in the spec seems like a particularly bad idea.
[2014-08-20 08:42:19] jleyba: 2) vendor implementations, like chromedriver, may utilize internal code that will be difficult to build/distribute without their full toolchain
[2014-08-20 08:43:04] FlyingDog: does anyone one know how to get selenium to click a swf that is purely written by js?
[2014-08-20 08:43:34] WhereIsMySpoon: dont swfs have their own dom?
[2014-08-20 08:43:48] ato: The spec currently doesn't define any command sets (well it does, but it shouldn't) so I'm not sure how you'd define a command executor in spec terminology without specifying each individual driver's implementation details.
[2014-08-20 08:44:52] FlyingDog: there is no identifer for the flash, but the object on the page is surely flash

[2014-08-20 09:52:05] jimevans: i guess i'm still confused. first, this is exactly what a proxy is *for*, but whatever. second, it sounds like you're wanting to make sure the site-being-automated doesn't detect that you're using webdriver. manipulating headers won't have anything to do with that.
[2014-08-20 09:53:18] jimevans: or, if you're looking to actually capture requests sent by the browser for playback in a different raw-http-requests library, a proxy is a far better solution there too.

[2014-08-20 09:54:57] cryzed: jimevans, I am using Windows and I sometimes write scripts with python and selenium to automate downloads on javascript heavy sites etc. or similiar circumstances. I wasn't planning on running an additional proxy software constantly just to make sure that my scripts run with the full expected functionality. If the request headers you sent suddenly change drastically (for example user-agent) while using the same cookies (which can happens if you just take
[2014-08-20 09:54:58] cryzed: the cookies returned by the webdriver and use them with the requests library) it can be easily detected
[2014-08-20 09:55:02] cryzed: that's what I'm trying to avoid
[2014-08-20 09:55:22] cryzed: *happen
[2014-08-20 09:55:50] cryzed: I just want to make sure that the GET requests I make look identical to the ones I did earlier with the webdriver
[2014-08-20 09:56:30] jimevans: cryzed: and again, proxy is the right solution, but whatever,.
[2014-08-20 09:56:51] jimevans: it's like three extra lines of webdriver code in python.
[2014-08-20 09:57:22] cryzed: Ok, I'll bite. I run Windows, what proxy should I use
[2014-08-20 09:57:35] cryzed: that I can easily copy the headers from the previous request from, programatically
[2014-08-20 09:57:38] jimevans: take your pick.
[2014-08-20 09:58:07] cryzed: how exactly am I supposed to access the headers then that were sent by my webdriver with Python
[2014-08-20 09:58:10] cryzed: it's more than 3 lines
[2014-08-20 09:58:20] jimevans: i know fiddler pretty well, and that's really useful for .NET code, because you can control it easily from within the code.
[2014-08-20 09:58:47] jimevans: but you're really missing the point, and it's clear i can't convince you otherwise.
[2014-08-20 09:59:04] jimevans: so like i said, whatever.
[2014-08-20 09:59:33] cryzed: I don't think I am. My plan was to write a class that wraps a webdriver instance that can be passed in by the end-user and then expose a requests method that transparently inserts the default HTTP request headers usually sent by the passed-in webdriver
[2014-08-20 09:59:38] cryzed: I thought this was the easiest solution
[2014-08-20 10:00:06] cryzed: and I wasn't planning to make an always-running proxy a requirement
[2014-08-20 10:00:18] cryzed: but thanks for the discussion
[2014-08-20 10:00:22] jimevans: the problem is that in the generic case, the driver doesn't know anything about the http request sent by the browser.
[2014-08-20 10:00:29] jimevans: full stop.
[2014-08-20 10:01:10] jimevans: you don't need an always-running proxy. i'm not as well-versed in the python ecosystem, but surely there's a programmatically configurable proxy in python that you can control from python code.
[2014-08-20 10:02:07] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 819
[2014-08-20 10:02:31] jimevans: so the idea is you programmatically start the proxy (from python), create your driver instance, do your webdriver stuff, then stop the proxy. grab the data captured by the proxy (either programmatically, or have it write to a file) and you're golden.

[2014-08-20 10:03:42] jimevans: AutomatedTester, lukeis: y'all know the python ecosystem better than i do, is there a python proxy that can be programmatically controlled at runtime?

[2014-08-20 10:04:51] jimevans: smccarthy: that's fine, if you're have/are willing to use the java runtime.

[2014-08-20 10:05:09] cryzed: or missing data?
[2014-08-20 10:05:43] cryzed: I mean I see your point, this would be more "professional" I suppose -- but why use a proxy, with a Python library to access it
[2014-08-20 10:05:49] cryzed: when this seems much easier with less overhead
[2014-08-20 10:05:56] cryzed: unless you think it might not work as expectd
[2014-08-20 10:06:28] jimevans: if you have total control over the server that's running, your implementation is fine.
[2014-08-20 10:06:47] jimevans: it'll work great for localhost, i suppose.
[2014-08-20 10:06:53] jimevans: maybe.

[2014-08-20 10:07:18] cryzed: Oh yes, of course I do. It just runs for a second or so to serve that single request and pass on the headers to the execution of the script
[2014-08-20 10:08:08] jimevans: but i fail to see how your implementation is going to intercept the http request from your browser to a third-party server that you don't control, or that doesn't dump the headers back to you somehow.
[2014-08-20 10:08:29] jimevans: and "of course" is not self-evident from your description of what you're doing.
[2014-08-20 10:08:42] cryzed: I wasn't planning on intercepting anything
[2014-08-20 10:08:48] cryzed: to third-party servers
[2014-08-20 10:09:00] cryzed: my concern was that each browser sends slightly different headers in a usual get request to webservers
[2014-08-20 10:09:09] cryzed: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding bla bla (I don't know all of them)
[2014-08-20 10:09:21] cryzed: And I wanted to retrieve these "default" get headers usually sent programatically
[2014-08-20 10:09:28] cryzed: so I can sent them with my additional headers from another library
[2014-08-20 10:09:36] cryzed: to look like I am still the browser I used initially
[2014-08-20 10:10:18] cryzed: for example I can imagine that the requests library in Python doesn't even bother to sent the Accept-Language request headers
[2014-08-20 10:10:32] cryzed: while my browser used with webdriver does
[2014-08-20 10:11:34] jimevans: so you're not really using webdriver to drive the sites you're interested in. you're just using it for data gathering. that's fine. from your initial description, it sounded like you wanted to use some custom headers *in addition to* those sent by the browser during normal operation while using webdriver.

[2014-08-20 10:12:26] cryzed: and now I wanted to download a file after logging in
[2014-08-20 10:12:33] cryzed: that isn't easily automated with a webdriver
[2014-08-20 10:12:52] cryzed: so I would log in with the webdriver, get the normal request headers it sents in a get requests in addition to its cookies
[2014-08-20 10:13:06] cryzed: and make a get request with my Python library to download the file "manually"
[2014-08-20 10:13:36] cryzed: It seems a bit strange, I know, but I guess those are the webdriver limitations. I don't know of a way to download a file with a webdriver instance reliably for example
[2014-08-20 10:14:21] jimevans: you're approaching it the correct way, with a direct http connection.
[2014-08-20 10:14:30] jimevans: s/it/downloading a file/
[2014-08-20 10:14:43] cryzed: yep. And I thought this was the easiest way to "spoof"
[2014-08-20 10:14:47] cryzed: that I am still the same browser
[2014-08-20 10:14:52] cryzed: from my Python script
[2014-08-20 10:15:04] cryzed: if suddenly the headers changed slightly it could be detected
[2014-08-20 10:15:24] cryzed: of course you might be right, the browser might sent different headers to the third-party servers than to the localhost
[2014-08-20 10:15:33] cryzed: for example definitely the Cookies
[2014-08-20 10:15:40] cryzed: but I can get those manually via the webdriver instance

[2014-08-20 10:16:30] cryzed: that is what I was interested in
[2014-08-20 10:17:53] cryzed: and with this "mechanism" I could have a class that wraps a webdriver instance you can pass in from your script and I can figure out at runtime what the stnadard http request headers look like from the passed in webdriver instance.

[2014-08-20 11:20:57] Xodz: so according to my gist, I can add the try catch below my do while loop? and it will continue to loop even after element appears, is that right?
[2014-08-20 11:21:55] ato: What are you trying to do here?
[2014-08-20 11:22:28] Xodz: that loop refreshes element constantly, each time the specific xpath appears (due to refresh) > alert me (or click it)
[2014-08-20 11:22:53] Xodz: if 2 appear one after another, 2 alerts will pop up
[2014-08-20 11:28:38] barancev: simonstewart: hi! who has rights to deploy to http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/ ? we need to ship a new IDE version

[2014-08-20 12:46:27] dimacus: Siecje: do you know the container class or id or what div or elements are around it?
[2014-08-20 12:48:03] Siecje: dimacus: I'm trying to avoid it. I'm just testing that the user sees this text.
[2014-08-20 12:49:02] dimacus: well there is a horrible way to do it, which is just to check if some text is on the screen somewhere
[2014-08-20 12:49:13] dimacus: but that's really bad for many reasons
[2014-08-20 12:49:46] Siecje: why?
[2014-08-20 12:50:37] dimacus: ok so here is how you could do it
[2014-08-20 12:50:46] dimacus: find_element(:tag, "body").text
[2014-08-20 12:50:57] dimacus: or in css form

[2014-08-20 12:51:20] dimacus: and then you search the whole output for the given string
[2014-08-20 12:52:05] Siecje: but you can have false positives in say <script> tags? Why is it not recommended?
[2014-08-20 12:52:53] dimacus: you shouldn't get a false positive in that situation
[2014-08-20 12:53:19] dimacus: but let's say you have 2 divs that have same text, and you want to check that only the left one has it, then it gets tricky
[2014-08-20 12:54:11] Siecje: I think I might go with it for now until it gets more complicated
[2014-08-20 12:54:47] dimacus: fair enough, but just remeber, it's like using Global variables, it's easy and a fast fix at first, but ends up bitting you in the ass in the long run :)

[2014-08-20 16:03:37] barancev: which one?
[2014-08-20 16:03:47] Phasze: I can't remember, it was so long ago...
[2014-08-20 16:04:29] barancev: probably not
[2014-08-20 16:04:49] Phasze: It added most of the commands to the C# webdriver export

[2014-08-20 16:05:15] seljenkinsbot: Alexei Barantsev: Updating IDE release to 2.6.0
[2014-08-20 16:05:16] barancev: no, it is not merged yet
[2014-08-20 16:06:04] Phasze: heh, I should probably update that request with my latest stuff as well
[2014-08-20 16:06:17] Phasze: if you ever wanted to merge it, if not I won't worry about it
[2014-08-20 16:06:47] barancev: nobody hope I'll support IDE. I'm not :)
[2014-08-20 16:08:16] barancev: but... if you stash your pull request to a single commit I can apply it
