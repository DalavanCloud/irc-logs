[2014-08-12 00:29:28] AndreiH: hi guys
[2014-08-12 00:29:53] AndreiH: does selenium stopped supporting AndroidDriver?
[2014-08-12 00:30:45] AutomatedTester: AndreiH: yes, we recomment using Selendroid which works A LOT better :)
[2014-08-12 00:31:02] AutomatedTester: :google selendroid.io
[2014-08-12 00:31:03] selbot2: Selendroid: Selenium for Android: http://selendroid.io/

[2014-08-12 00:36:20] AutomatedTester: ok, not sure how they are related to android driver/selendroid
[2014-08-12 00:36:26] AndreiH: I saw that Saucelabs is using Appium and Selendroid
[2014-08-12 00:36:28] AndreiH: yes
[2014-08-12 00:36:43] AutomatedTester: appium just wraps selendroid
[2014-08-12 00:36:50] AndreiH: But they don't support opening the native browser on Android
[2014-08-12 00:37:01] AndreiH: http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/51370580-Android-Desired-Capabilities
[2014-08-12 00:37:18] AutomatedTester: unfortunately no one supports that
[2014-08-12 00:37:24] AndreiH: :(
[2014-08-12 00:37:25] AutomatedTester: not even Android driver did that
[2014-08-12 00:37:28] AndreiH: locally works fine for me
[2014-08-12 00:37:45] AutomatedTester: raise an issue with them

[2014-08-12 00:39:54] AndreiH: Currently, Sauce Labs is not supporting Mobile Web Application tests using Android + Appium
[2014-08-12 00:40:11] AutomatedTester: Selendroid and AndroidDriver work by loading a webview and controlling that
[2014-08-12 00:40:40] AutomatedTester: but AndroidDriver was deprecated and removed from the WebDriver project because Selendroid does a much better job
[2014-08-12 00:41:55] AndreiH: got it
[2014-08-12 00:42:07] AndreiH: but as I see from here http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/51370580-Android-Desired-Capabilities
[2014-08-12 00:42:26] AndreiH: I don't know if they support  Mobile Web Application + Selendroid
[2014-08-12 00:43:48] AutomatedTester: maybe don't use Saucelabs then?
[2014-08-12 00:44:16] AndreiH: AutomatedTester, any suggestions ?
[2014-08-12 00:44:25] AndreiH: besides using saucelabs
[2014-08-12 00:44:34] AutomatedTester: do it in house?
[2014-08-12 00:44:56] AutomatedTester: if a company isnt solving your needs solve it yourself

[2014-08-12 08:42:50] jimevans: not always, but usually
[2014-08-12 08:43:22] ponch_: jimevans: i agree but nothing i have been able to do has been able to resolve the timing problem
[2014-08-12 08:44:02] ponch_: it isn't one consistently location nor does adding wait.until {...} work consistently
[2014-08-12 08:44:29] jimevans: you realize your question, as asked, is so broad as to be meaningless, right?
[2014-08-12 08:45:12] jimevans: sorry, meaningless is the wrong word. unanswerable is more accurate.
[2014-08-12 08:45:24] smccarthy: ponch_: one way I use to check if it is a timing issue, is by adding a long wait (maybe 15 seconds), just to see if its a timing issue. Than I can remove that long wait, and wait for the correct event to occur.

[2014-08-12 08:47:55] ponch_: smccarthy: when i run it on my local machine yes but i'm trying to integrate circle ci which runs your tests automatically after each push to github
[2014-08-12 08:48:13] ponch_: smccarthy: so i can't watch it run when circle ci is running
[2014-08-12 08:48:33] smccarthy: ponch_: yea, but you can watch it when you run it locally. Does it still sometimes fail when running locally ?
[2014-08-12 08:49:00] ponch_: yes but it seems to just hang on a certain process and it will eventually timeout
[2014-08-12 08:49:27] smccarthy: ponch_: do you take screenshots on failures ?
[2014-08-12 08:50:00] ponch_: i tried to integrate sauce labs but i don't think so -- is it complicated to get it to take screenshots on failure

[2014-08-12 08:55:30] jimevans: plato: and how, exactly, would you hook this up from an exterior process that has no insight into what javascript may be running on the page? before you answer, i ask you to consider the race conditions involved (hooking to the event before it exists in the DOM, hooking to the event after it's already been processed, etc.). how much control do you have over the content on the page being automated?
[2014-08-12 08:58:17] plato: Well, i can use webdriver to click on things and set the location, I was hoping it could also tell me about events
[2014-08-12 08:58:44] WhereIsMySpoon: wrong
[2014-08-12 08:59:28] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver is not a copy of the currently running javascript engine
[2014-08-12 09:00:08] plato: ok, well i might have an XY problem here. My problem is, my tests start running before polymer.js finishes manipulating the dom
[2014-08-12 09:00:10] jimevans: plato: inspired by your irc nick, i was trying (and apparently failing) to be socratic. my second question still stands though.
[2014-08-12 09:00:39] WhereIsMySpoon: plato: then you need to find some piece of dom that is only visible when your dom has finished being manipulated
[2014-08-12 09:00:40] plato: jimevans: i'm testing my own app, so, full control
[2014-08-12 09:00:43] jimevans: how much control do you have over the source code of the page being automated (an

[2014-08-12 09:02:50] plato: jimevans: i'm confused now, it sounds like you are saying 'poll, from protractor, for a javascript variable that I set in my event'
[2014-08-12 09:02:58] jimevans: no.

[2014-08-12 09:03:13] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-12 09:03:35] WhereIsMySpoon: so you'd have some sort of fluent wait that in the apply method would executeScript("return myvar;")
[2014-08-12 09:03:41] jimevans: in protractor, set a value in the event you want to wait for. in webdriver, using the javascriptexecutor (or whatever your language binding allows), poll for that value.
[2014-08-12 09:03:42] WhereIsMySpoon: then test the value of that
[2014-08-12 09:04:00] *WhereIsMySpoon thinks that me and jim are on the same wavelength'
[2014-08-12 09:04:25] plato: i think jimevans you may be confusing protractor (a js api to webdriver) and polymer.js (a material design library)
[2014-08-12 09:04:35] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont think he is
[2014-08-12 09:04:35] jimevans: sorry. polymer, then.
[2014-08-12 09:04:36] jimevans: whatever.
[2014-08-12 09:04:46] WhereIsMySpoon: oh wait, yea
[2014-08-12 09:04:52] jimevans: the point is, you have some javascript event that you want to listen for, no?
[2014-08-12 09:05:06] ponch_: is there an onTestFailure method in ruby webdriver ?
[2014-08-12 09:05:19] jimevans: you can, in your page's source code, use that event to do some manipulation, no?
[2014-08-12 09:05:48] plato: well, the polymer library fires the event, but in my source code I can listen and fire a similar event {testable: true}
[2014-08-12 09:06:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jim - On a separate topic altogether...I've been migrating some more tests to the page object model, and found an interesting problem...how do I deal with functions that return a different page object, but this new page object actually opens in a new window? At the moment I have to do this http://pastie.org/9467153# and it's kinda iffy
[2014-08-12 09:06:07] smccarthy: ponch_: onTestFailure is for TestNG (Java)
[2014-08-12 09:06:08] plato: The problem is that: I don't kno whow to tell webdriver using the javascriptexecutor to poll for that value

[2014-08-12 09:06:25] smccarthy: ponch_: maybe your test framework you are using for java has something similar
[2014-08-12 09:06:36] smccarthy: i mean ruby
[2014-08-12 09:06:37] jimevans: if you're using the raw webdriver api, i can tell you, but i strongly suspect you aren't.
[2014-08-12 09:06:43] smccarthy: I dont know ruby though.
[2014-08-12 09:06:58] plato: jimevans: i'm not, but, i have docs to look up if you have a specific api call in mind
[2014-08-12 09:08:11] Marcovanest, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-12 09:08:29] jimevans: plato: but the webdriver api has a method called executeScript (in java, on the JavascriptExecutor interface; in .NET it's ExecuteScript on IJavaScriptExecutor; in python and ruby, it's execute_script, and hangs directly off the driver object without having to cast to a role-based interface).
[2014-08-12 09:08:56] plato: jimevans: ok. i think I see it. https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/api.md#webdriverwebdriverprototypewait

[2014-08-12 09:09:33] jimevans: i don't know the "javascript equivalent" for the webdriver api, because i hate the javascript community's approach to the webdriver api, and refuse to get drawn into the "not-invented-here" syndrome so many javascript developers seem to fall victim to.

[2014-08-12 09:14:16] jimevans: sorry, no, i missed it. one second.
[2014-08-12 09:15:46] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that looks right. what's the problem?
[2014-08-12 09:16:05] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: Im having to reference an element from OtherPage inside SomePage
[2014-08-12 09:16:14] WhereIsMySpoon: which seems to run counter to the page object model
[2014-08-12 09:16:30] jimevans: why?
[2014-08-12 09:16:32] WhereIsMySpoon: ideally, I'd like to not have to deal with this window swapping at all in goOtherPage
[2014-08-12 09:16:52] dborin, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-12 09:17:03] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: because if OtherPage changes, I have to change both whatever field in OtherPage references that element, and the reference in goOtherPage
[2014-08-12 09:17:05] Dave_B_: have to deal with it somewhere, and it's that page that opens the window, so makes sense for it to be there
[2014-08-12 09:17:16] Dave_B_: bit of a pain though :(
[2014-08-12 09:17:47] plato: /j polymer
[2014-08-12 09:17:50] plato: woops
[2014-08-12 09:18:51] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: it just seems a bit clunky
[2014-08-12 09:19:49] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: there's a better way. why not look for the element in the constructor of OtherPage, if that's your trigger that OtherPage is loaded?
[2014-08-12 09:20:27] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: because the apply method has to return something
[2014-08-12 09:20:59] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2014-08-12 09:21:03] jimevans: sure. but all it has to return is a non-null or non-false value
[2014-08-12 09:21:20] jimevans: (or it should be that way if memory serves)
[2014-08-12 09:22:00] jimevans: in the java implementation, the wait can expect an object or a boolean.
[2014-08-12 09:22:06] WhereIsMySpoon: Boolean
[2014-08-12 09:22:09] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea
[2014-08-12 09:22:24] WhereIsMySpoon: (primitives arent allowed)
[2014-08-12 09:23:03] jimevans: so use the webdriverwait to wait until the new window has been switched to, then return a new OtherPage(driver), where in the constructor, you look for the element you need to insure the page is loaded.
[2014-08-12 09:23:27] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-08-12 09:23:30] WhereIsMySpoon: that makes like
[2014-08-12 09:23:33] WhereIsMySpoon: 10000 sense
[2014-08-12 09:23:39] Dave_B_: oh was that a wait, i skim-read and assumed he was identifying which window to switch to via the element
[2014-08-12 09:23:47] *Dave_B_ slaps forehead'
[2014-08-12 09:23:56] jimevans: despite appearances, i do have lucid moments.
[2014-08-12 09:23:57] WhereIsMySpoon: no

[2014-08-12 09:28:10] WhereIsMySpoon: let me just make a code
[2014-08-12 09:28:44] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: http://pastie.org/9467457 say I have this
[2014-08-12 09:28:55] WhereIsMySpoon: what if on the first pass it doens tswitch to the window
[2014-08-12 09:28:56] jimevans: nononononono
[2014-08-12 09:29:01] WhereIsMySpoon: nononononono?
[2014-08-12 09:29:06] jimevans: no, no, no, no
[2014-08-12 09:29:13] WhereIsMySpoon: there's no limit?
[2014-08-12 09:29:24] jimevans: don't return the "otherpage" from the apply function
[2014-08-12 09:29:58] jimevans: put it outside the wait.
[2014-08-12 09:30:00] WhereIsMySpoon: what should I do then sorry

[2014-08-12 09:37:54] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: because that assumes that the window switch works first time

[2014-08-12 12:14:12] plato: Hey guys got another question. Does .wait(function) repeatedly call this function until it gets something truthy?
[2014-08-12 12:15:04] jleyba: which language?
[2014-08-12 12:15:18] plato: javscript, using the protractor library: https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/api.md#webdriverwebdriverprototypewait
[2014-08-12 12:16:14] jleyba: yes, it will call it repeatedly until it gets a truthy value*
[2014-08-12 12:16:19] plato: thx jleyba
[2014-08-12 12:16:30] jleyba: * if it returns a promise, it will wait for it to resolve before making the truthy check
[2014-08-12 12:18:26] plato: It is returning a promise (the result of executeScript)
[2014-08-12 12:18:45] plato: which I thought resolved as soon as I returned something from executeScript
[2014-08-12 12:20:04] jleyba: wait(fn) = promise.when(fn()) -> if !truhty, repeat
[2014-08-12 12:20:24] plato: yeah, that's how i thought it worked. nuts. thx
[2014-08-12 12:20:57] jleyba: looping with promises is a pain in the ass, so there could be bugs there
[2014-08-12 12:21:29] jleyba: feel free to file a bug if you find one (or think you found one)
[2014-08-12 12:23:55] plato: i'm still trying to delay my tests until a particular event happens in my app; i'm creating <meta id="SoProTestsReady"> in my app when that fires
[2014-08-12 12:24:29] jleyba: can you use executeAsyncScript?
[2014-08-12 12:25:12] plato: and I have browser.wait(return browser.executeScript(function(){ return document.getElementById("SoProTestsReady") !== null }))
[2014-08-12 12:25:54] plato: if I do `return true` from the executeScript, execution continues, but for some reason the comparison never resolves to true
[2014-08-12 12:26:22] plato: in fact, when I start my test suite, I can see in the browser window that the execution of the rest of the code halts. the event appears to not be fired and it times out
[2014-08-12 12:26:31] plato: if I load the page normally, it fires after a couple seconds
[2014-08-12 12:26:57] plato: could this wait() be blocking the js thread and preventing the rest of the page's scripts from running?
[2014-08-12 12:28:08] jleyba: how are you running your tests?
[2014-08-12 12:28:14] jleyba: browser + node version?
