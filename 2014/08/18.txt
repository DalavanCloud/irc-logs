[2014-08-18 10:29:42] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't either. mostly because the mongoose web server it uses had issues with it.
[2014-08-18 10:30:19] jimevans: although, i've got a branch which has moved to civetweb (an MIT-licensed fork of mongoose) that may have fixed the issue.
[2014-08-18 10:30:30] ato: chromedriver also used to use that, or has it switched to the internal net/httpd server in Chromium now?
[2014-08-18 10:30:38] lukeis: the python code has two paths in it… one for keep alines, the other for IE and chrome ;)
[2014-08-18 10:30:46] jleyba: I thought chromedriver2 had dropped mongoose in favor of a http server in the chromium code base. could be wrong though

[2014-08-18 11:02:07] dimacus: why would you want to throw away the logs? half the time that's the only way to debug the grid going off the rails
[2014-08-18 11:02:16] dimacus: (happened 2 times now for me in last 2 months)
[2014-08-18 11:02:24] Phasze: My grid usually doesn't fail :P
[2014-08-18 11:03:06] Phasze: and I only have 6GB free on these VMs, so I'd have to turn off logging or clean it up with my own program

[2014-08-18 11:05:32] dimacus: had one situation where timeouts were out of sync
[2014-08-18 11:05:57] dimacus: and so some nodes were timing out and it would try to send a new request to just timed out grid
[2014-08-18 11:06:18] Phasze: ah, I think I resolved most of those cases when I first configured the grid
[2014-08-18 11:07:21] dimacus: yeah
[2014-08-18 11:07:26] dimacus: i had to learn the hard way

[2014-08-18 11:12:31] smccarthy: dimacus: speaking about selenium-grid-extras, would the ability to download and install a specific version of firefox be a good addition? I added it locally in my copy for now.
[2014-08-18 11:13:00] dimacus: hmmmm well dunno… since firefox auto updates from version 24+
[2014-08-18 11:13:12] smccarthy: it does? I set it to NOT auto update.
[2014-08-18 11:13:20] dimacus: ahhhh
[2014-08-18 11:13:40] dimacus: yeah i think that might work… but i'm wondering if that should be handled by something external like chef or puppet?
[2014-08-18 11:13:49] smccarthy: The way I have it now, is that I install it using the command line, and copy/replace the config files so it doesnt update
[2014-08-18 11:14:00] smccarthy: dimacus: yea I wasnt sure either
[2014-08-18 11:14:16] smccarthy: I also added an endpoint for get_firefox_version , to return the version of firefox installed
[2014-08-18 11:14:17] dimacus: i almost feel like browser installation should be seporate
[2014-08-18 11:14:21] smccarthy: k
[2014-08-18 11:14:23] dimacus: ooooo
[2014-08-18 11:14:26] dimacus: i do like that!
[2014-08-18 11:14:29] dimacus: i want a PR for that
[2014-08-18 11:14:38] smccarthy: ok, i'll create a new PR for that
[2014-08-18 11:14:47] dimacus: does that work cross paltform or only windows?
[2014-08-18 11:15:02] dimacus: bc i was wondering how to get the versions of firefox and chrome on windows boxes
[2014-08-18 11:15:05] smccarthy: for now, its just windows :( But I can try for Mac and Linux as well
[2014-08-18 11:15:22] smccarthy: chrome is almost impossible on windows lol (at least for me)
[2014-08-18 11:15:24] dimacus: chrome does not have the -v command so it would be somewhere hidden in the registry
[2014-08-18 11:15:26] smccarthy: the --version doesnt work for chrome
[2014-08-18 11:15:33] dimacus: so the idea i had was this
[2014-08-18 11:15:35] dimacus: at boot
[2014-08-18 11:15:50] smccarthy: yea i found it in the registry, but i think its different spots in the registy depending on the version of Chrome.
[2014-08-18 11:16:01] dimacus: try to open each possible supported browser 1 at the time, if it opens, say the box has that browser if it timesous out or throws exception
[2014-08-18 11:16:06] dimacus: that box does not have browser
[2014-08-18 11:16:22] dimacus: then navigate to a page and use JS to get the major version
[2014-08-18 11:16:35] dimacus: this way all nodes self register all browsers installed and versinos
[2014-08-18 11:16:57] smccarthy: https://gist.github.com/smccarthy/a70e4e49798d8cebc4bb
[2014-08-18 11:17:03] smccarthy: thats how I get the version of firefox on windows
[2014-08-18 11:17:23] dimacus: yeah…. hmmm
[2014-08-18 11:18:11] dimacus: i wonder if it's just better to do it in JS
[2014-08-18 11:18:20] lukeis1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-08-18 11:18:28] dimacus: bc i seen a code snippet that would detect any browser, including opera and safari
[2014-08-18 11:18:38] smccarthy: oh wow nice
[2014-08-18 11:19:20] dimacus: smccarthy: http://www.javascripter.net/faq/browserv.htm
[2014-08-18 11:20:17] smccarthy: so that requires you to open the browser to get the version ?
[2014-08-18 11:21:05] dimacus: yes but think about this way, the first time you run the xtras, the promt asks you "what browsers you have" instead that is automatically detected by opening Firefox and navigating to the page with that JS
[2014-08-18 11:21:27] dimacus: if you get a version, then we say "node has firefox X" if that is not accomplished we say "node does not have firefox"
[2014-08-18 11:21:30] dimacus: so 2 birds
[2014-08-18 11:23:25] smccarthy: ok, but what about if the browser auto updates? wont we have to check for the browser version again ?
[2014-08-18 11:23:46] dimacus: everytime the grid extras is re-launched it would check the versions
[2014-08-18 11:23:52] smccarthy: oh ok
[2014-08-18 11:23:56] dimacus: this will probably add 30 to 60 seconds to boot
[2014-08-18 11:23:58] smccarthy: makes sense. I like that way too
[2014-08-18 11:24:04] dimacus: but will always be up to date
[2014-08-18 11:24:18] smccarthy: so whatever version it detects, will be put in the node config file ?
[2014-08-18 11:24:35] dimacus: yup
[2014-08-18 11:24:45] smccarthy: sweet. I def like that better than my solution.
[2014-08-18 11:24:49] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-18 11:24:51] dimacus: so if chrome updates, than next reboot the config auto updates
[2014-08-18 11:25:02] dimacus: that's the next feature i want to work on
[2014-08-18 11:27:21] smccarthy: oh sweet k. I noticed kill_all_by_name isnt working for me on windows. It seems it is taking the parameter and duplicating it. I used name=test , and get this output :     "ERROR: The process \"testtest\" not found.\r"
[2014-08-18 11:27:26] smccarthy: I was gonna look at that later today

[2014-08-18 11:28:42] dimacus: i got so slammed with iOS/Android build i can't even sneeze :(
[2014-08-18 11:29:11] smccarthy: yea no worries. I will try after some paid-work stuff today.

[2014-08-18 11:53:32] jimevans: Phasze: you don't.
[2014-08-18 11:53:46] jimevans: the version is not an option you can (or should) set via ChromeOptions.
[2014-08-18 11:54:06] Phasze: Hmmm
[2014-08-18 11:54:10] jimevans: you have to do it via capabilities, because it's something only the java remote server (or grid) would understand.
[2014-08-18 11:54:17] jimevans: think about it.

[2014-08-18 12:02:13] jimevans: remember, you're taking what's intended to be used with the local driver (ChromeOptions), and augmenting it for use with remote.
[2014-08-18 12:03:14] Phasze: there isn't another way to set the language options with desiredcapabilties right?
[2014-08-18 12:03:31] jimevans: i don't know.
[2014-08-18 12:03:40] jimevans: how are the language options actually set?
[2014-08-18 12:03:45] jleyba, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-18 12:03:45] jimevans: as an argument to chrome.exe?
[2014-08-18 12:03:58] Phasze: dunno
[2014-08-18 12:04:09] jimevans: how would you do it manually?
[2014-08-18 12:04:27] Phasze: in the settings, under advanced there is a language option
[2014-08-18 12:04:52] jimevans: okay, how would you do it without using the Chrome UI?
[2014-08-18 12:05:12] jimevans: because with AddArgument, what you're asking the driver to do is append that arg to the chrome.exe command line.
[2014-08-18 12:05:28] jimevans: if that's not how to do it in chrome, then using AddArgument isn't the right approach.
[2014-08-18 12:05:28] Phasze: yeah, so I assume that is how, "--lang"
[2014-08-18 12:05:41] jimevans: quite an assumption.
[2014-08-18 12:05:49] Phasze: it's what google told me to do :P
[2014-08-18 12:06:11] jimevans: then that *should* do it, if memory serves.
[2014-08-18 12:06:23] jimevans: what version of the bindings are you using?
[2014-08-18 12:06:41] Phasze: yeah it worked fine
[2014-08-18 12:06:44] Phasze: just had to cast it
[2014-08-18 12:06:57] Phasze: 2.10
[2014-08-18 12:07:19] jimevans: yeah, i thought it might return ICapabilities.
[2014-08-18 12:07:48] jimevans: and i think you misunderstood my question. you're using 2.10 of chromedriver.exe. you're likely using something much different of the .NET bindings. :)
[2014-08-18 12:08:50] Phasze: ah yeah, it's 2.40 or 2.42
[2014-08-18 12:09:05] Phasze: can't remember what I actually have on the lab
[2014-08-18 12:09:54] jimevans: it makes a difference. there was a pretty bad bug in passing capabilities to chromedriver.exe, but i don't remember what version it was fixed in off the top of my head. 2.40+ should be okay.

[2014-08-18 15:45:11] AutomatedTester: I can't book travel for the week of GTAC since I dont know where to land
[2014-08-18 15:46:33] jleyba: I haven't seen any announcements since the original that it was happening

[2014-08-18 15:49:59] AutomatedTester: jleyba: seems a little weird leaving it quite late... some companies dont like staff booking flights with less than 2 months to go due to costs
[2014-08-18 15:51:41] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I doubt they're considering that. You can book whenever here as long as you're under travel cap, so they probably haven't even thought about it.
[2014-08-18 15:52:13] AutomatedTester: jleyba: welll they didnt think about the webdriver team... not surprised
[2014-08-18 15:52:29] AutomatedTester: too mean?
[2014-08-18 15:52:58] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I'd argue that Selenium is too old for GTAC. Been there, done that kind of thing
[2014-08-18 15:53:51] AutomatedTester: sure... but dont ignore one of the main products used internally
[2014-08-18 15:54:05] AutomatedTester: do you even know who I am?!?!?!?
