[2014-08-15 09:11:37] jimevans: no, not at all.
[2014-08-15 09:12:17] jimevans: we use selendroid, and yes we use it in saucelabs.
[2014-08-15 09:12:20] jimevans: fairly extensively
[2014-08-15 09:12:42] andy_seit: For mobile web?  Or is that just for native app
[2014-08-15 09:12:52] jimevans: but lukeis is a lot closer to that than i am.
[2014-08-15 09:13:01] jimevans: which is why i mentioned him.
[2014-08-15 09:13:14] andy_seit: Ok cool, thanks
[2014-08-15 09:13:18] lukeis: andy_seit: on android we mainly do native/hybrid (our app has webviews, lots of them)
[2014-08-15 09:14:07] lukeis: but selendroid can do "web" but basically just through a simple app that is just a webview
[2014-08-15 09:14:15] andy_seit: Ok thanks guys.  I was trying to figure out how much of the utter fail I'm experiencing with Saucelabs+AndroidDriver (as opposed to selendroid) I should blame on myself
[2014-08-15 09:14:21] lukeis: if you really want to do web, then you should be using chromedriver
[2014-08-15 09:14:59] lukeis: this should not be used at all anymore, anywhere :wiki AndroidDriver
[2014-08-15 09:15:00] selbot2: 1: 03AndroidDriver: MobileWebDriverAndroidautomation - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AndroidDriver
[2014-08-15 09:15:07] jimevans: andy_seit: AndroidDriver? the one that used to be included with Selenium? the one that's been deprecated for months?
[2014-08-15 09:15:18] andy_seit: Yep thanks the one
[2014-08-15 09:15:30] jimevans: yeah, don't use that
[2014-08-15 09:15:41] andy_seit: That's what I said :)
[2014-08-15 09:16:05] lukeis: andy_seit: since saucelabs only allows you to run Appium in their cloud (but under the hood uses Selendroid for web view apps) I would recommend uploading to sauce storage the "androiddriver.apk" that is bundled in selendroid and then using that
[2014-08-15 09:16:18] lukeis: lemme help you do that ;)
[2014-08-15 09:16:50] andy_seit: Oh no I don't want to waste your time, we're quickly coming up to the end of our 90-day opt out period
[2014-08-15 09:17:04] andy_seit: if it was a viable alternative I wish their support had suggested it earlier :/
[2014-08-15 09:17:12] lukeis: meh, would be good to get the details somewhere written down and proven it works
[2014-08-15 09:17:32] lukeis: download and then upload to sauce storage:  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/selendroid/android-driver-app/0.11.0/android-driver-app-0.11.0.apk
[2014-08-15 09:18:00] maxorator: jimevans, didn't seem to help, I did manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(0, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS) on the driver and catch TimeoutExceptions (I checked, they are thrown)
[2014-08-15 09:18:22] andy_seit: * taking notes
[2014-08-15 09:18:47] maxorator: when I have a script on my page that connects to an external site, it will cause the navigation to the page take ~500ms longer
[2014-08-15 09:18:48] lukeis: andy_seit: the last bit is to get the right desired capabilities to request it appropriatelyâ€¦. give me a couple of min
[2014-08-15 09:18:51] jimevans: maxorator: i'm not sure what you're actually trying to do, and why it's important to *not* wait for the javascript to load.
[2014-08-15 09:20:12] maxorator: I'm using it to measure performance of the site
[2014-08-15 09:21:07] maxorator: I want to immediately check when all the required visual parts are visible (some may take long to render or are created due to websocket or our own scripts later)
[2014-08-15 09:21:08] jimevans: maxorator: webdriver is not the right tool for that. you'll want to instrument your javascript using another library. i don't have a good suggestion.

[2014-08-15 09:28:14] jimevans: i gave you the only way to make the get() method (or equivalent). if that doesn't do the trip, you're out of luck. there is no consistent cross-browser way to accomplish what you're after. you might be able to set a page load strategy for firefox, but i don't think chrome has implemented anything like that, and i'm quite  sure IE hasn't.

[2014-08-15 14:08:54] jimevans: AutomatedTester: +1
[2014-08-15 14:09:44] jimevans: dude-x: Exhibit A is the difference between the android open source project, and the android that ships on android devices.
[2014-08-15 14:10:01] AutomatedTester: Android is not open source
[2014-08-15 14:10:07] AutomatedTester: its public source but not open source
[2014-08-15 14:10:09] dude-x: but locking someone to use the old IE means more sales of Windows; you can opt out of not using google services or even Chrome; their source code for the browser is open;

[2014-08-15 14:12:13] AutomatedTester: There are pieces in Chrome that are not in Chromium, its a friday night so don't know them off hand but Chrome !== Chromium

[2014-08-15 14:18:21] p_l: so far, the only browsers that were anywhere close to "mainstream" that got dropped were old IE and Opera
[2014-08-15 14:18:30] dude-x: At work I use Safari for work related things (i guess to take advantage of App Nap on Mavericks, but now Chrome has it) and Firefox for my personal browsing
[2014-08-15 14:18:46] dude-x: and Chrome for Flash related stuff, and some UI testing

[2014-08-15 14:22:16] AutomatedTester: so flash on Chrome is built and maintained by the chrome team
[2014-08-15 14:22:48] p_l: Chrome's built-in flash player, PDF engine, few other things, anything on NaCl/PNaCl use it to interact with the browser
[2014-08-15 14:23:17] p_l: AutomatedTester: well, it's pretty much in the same position to make itself a "standard" as nsplugin was
[2014-08-15 14:24:33] AutomatedTester: p_l: except they have no interest in doing that

[2014-08-15 14:28:04] AutomatedTester: an open source version? thats news to me
[2014-08-15 14:28:16] p_l: AutomatedTester: for the Pepper API, not for the plugin
[2014-08-15 14:28:38] p_l: (flash one - the pdf one afaik is open source. (P)NaCl is open source since the times it ran under firefox)
[2014-08-15 14:29:14] AutomatedTester: the thing with NSAPI (and it is shit) when it was created browsers didnt care about interop
[2014-08-15 14:29:30] AutomatedTester: it ran under Firefox?
[2014-08-15 14:29:34] p_l: AutomatedTester: yes
[2014-08-15 14:29:52] p_l: NaCl started out on Firefox, I think Chrome didn't exist back then
[2014-08-15 14:30:52] AutomatedTester: p_l: Wikipedia is suggesting otherwise
[2014-08-15 14:30:55] p_l: Mozilla was afaik quite vocally against allowing NaCl (which would require adding pepper api) as shared tech, though, so it's relegated to Chrome Apps
[2014-08-15 14:31:09] AutomatedTester: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client
[2014-08-15 14:31:50] AutomatedTester: "An alternative of sorts to NaCl is asm.js, which also allows C and C++ applications to be compiled to run in the browser (at up to half of native speeds), and also supports ahead-of-time compilation, but is a subset of JavaScript and hence backwards-compatible with browsers that do not support it directly."
[2014-08-15 14:31:52] AutomatedTester: thats Firefox

[2014-08-15 14:33:21] AutomatedTester: Mozilla was doing Native client code but was doing it via web apis and asm.js
[2014-08-15 14:33:57] p_l: asm.js is pretty much completely different
[2014-08-15 14:34:28] AutomatedTester: sure but it means you can run C++ code in the browser by cross compiling it
[2014-08-15 14:35:03] p_l: which I could do before as well. Both suck, unless your purpose is implementing the most gross HTML5 player to implement your whacked-off DRM
[2014-08-15 14:35:31] p_l: (and doing so while laughing at Mozilla)
[2014-08-15 14:36:08] AutomatedTester: EME ftw! no wait... the other one
[2014-08-15 14:36:17] p_l: back when NaCl was not much more than a small code.google.com page+wiki and few demos, it ran under firefox as plugin
[2014-08-15 14:36:20] p_l: AutomatedTester: no, before EME
[2014-08-15 14:36:55] p_l: "look, we can make a video decoder in asm.js!" "Thanks mozilla for answering our prayers to run bloated obfuscated DRM!"
[2014-08-15 14:39:09] AutomatedTester: lol... /be has such way with words http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/08/choose-firefox-now-or-later-you-wont.html?showComment=1408137721125#c802011053942026248
[2014-08-15 14:40:24] AutomatedTester: p_l: ^ thats relevant to our conversation
[2014-08-15 14:41:54] p_l: Anyway, PPAPI host and guest side are both open source, same with (P)NaCl part.
[2014-08-15 14:42:12] p_l: AutomatedTester: Personally I'd be interested more in replacement of nsplugin with ppapi
[2014-08-15 14:42:41] AutomatedTester: p_l: I would be interested in no plugins whatsoever

[2014-08-15 14:42:46] p_l: anything requiring use of emscripten means it's something I won't use anyway, so I can disregard that completely
[2014-08-15 14:43:34] AutomatedTester: p_l: but you would never know that emscripten was used if the site did their work
[2014-08-15 14:44:19] p_l: AutomatedTester: I meant for my own use
[2014-08-15 14:44:54] AutomatedTester: p_l: but with emscripten you can run things on all browsers
[2014-08-15 14:44:57] p_l: emscripten is just not a target (it's lousier than targeting JS directly, and that is lousy too)
[2014-08-15 14:44:59] AutomatedTester: since its just JS
[2014-08-15 14:45:09] p_l: AutomatedTester: I can make a frozen molass on all browsers
[2014-08-15 14:45:17] p_l: (from my pov)
[2014-08-15 14:46:38] p_l: Unfortunately, wishes aren't low-hanging common fruits, so I can forget my dream merge of best bits of Firefox and Chrome ;)

[2014-08-15 14:49:14] p_l: my personal stance is that if you're grabbing for emscripten or you don't have a proper packaging for local running (HTML5 appcache sadly disappointed me there, haven't heard of anything properly portable for anything complex), then it means you're solving the wrong problem
