[2014-08-14 02:24:11] WhereIsMySpoon: a wait for visibility
[2014-08-14 02:24:55] sm1ly: WhereIsMySpoon, I just put wait() ?

[2014-08-14 02:27:21] WhereIsMySpoon: well I code, just in java :)
[2014-08-14 02:28:01] sm1ly: WhereIsMySpoon, Im just system administrator, and we got deadline) my teammates ask me to help)
[2014-08-14 02:28:40] ato: That Python code looks pretty accurate, except for the passing of a tuple into visibility_of_element_located IIRC.
[2014-08-14 02:29:08] WhereIsMySpoon: sm1ly: haha nice :p
[2014-08-14 02:29:25] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: really? the advanced page does thte same
[2014-08-14 02:29:34] ato: No wait, I'm mistaken.
[2014-08-14 02:29:46] ato: Why the hell does it do that?

[2014-08-14 02:32:55] WhereIsMySpoon: please do
[2014-08-14 02:32:56] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-14 02:32:58] ato: Right, you can't interact with elements which are hidden.
[2014-08-14 02:33:19] ato: Or otherwise obstructed by something else.  E.g. “hidden to a user's eye”.
[2014-08-14 02:34:09] sm1ly: http://i.imgur.com/DwUcXpi.png after we click login - we cant see areas for input, but they are there

[2014-08-14 02:36:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i cant see imgur from work

[2014-08-14 02:37:07] WhereIsMySpoon: sm1ly: but if the areas are hidden then you cant interact with them
[2014-08-14 02:37:16] sm1ly: just added driver.find_element_by_link_text("Login").click()
[2014-08-14 02:38:03] ato: Hah.
[2014-08-14 02:38:10] sm1ly: and what about xpath? http://pastebin.com/3YMA2kTK
[2014-08-14 02:38:23] sm1ly: dudes ur awesome)
[2014-08-14 02:38:31] WhereIsMySpoon: what the heck is an /i
[2014-08-14 02:38:32] ato: Generally, try to favour CSS expressions over XPath if possible.
[2014-08-14 02:38:39] WhereIsMySpoon: input?
[2014-08-14 02:38:53] ato: <i>foo</i> is italic.
[2014-08-14 02:38:58] WhereIsMySpoon: oh...duh
[2014-08-14 02:39:07] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont think you can click on <i> elements...
[2014-08-14 02:39:10] ato: HTML from the dark ages.
[2014-08-14 02:39:13] sm1ly: css expressions. ok. ill try
[2014-08-14 02:39:21] WhereIsMySpoon: though i may be wrong..
[2014-08-14 02:39:27] ato: I think the click will bubble through to the a element though.
[2014-08-14 02:39:39] Abhyuday, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-14 02:39:42] WhereIsMySpoon: why do the /i then
[2014-08-14 02:39:44] WhereIsMySpoon: just leave it off
[2014-08-14 02:39:46] WhereIsMySpoon: o.o
[2014-08-14 02:41:31] ato: Well yeah (-:
[2014-08-14 02:47:22] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-14 02:47:54] sm1ly: what if I have no css expression on it?
[2014-08-14 02:48:38] ato: There's always an expression.
[2014-08-14 02:48:40] ato: See this: http://sny.no/2014/07/uniq
[2014-08-14 02:49:10] operatiay, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-08-14 02:49:27] sm1ly: #sidebar > ul:nth-child(1) > li:nth-child(3) > a:nth-child(1) > i:nth-child(1)
[2014-08-14 02:49:31] sm1ly: looks like this
[2014-08-14 02:52:15] sm1ly: so I need selectors, not expressions
[2014-08-14 02:52:16] sm1ly: ok
[2014-08-14 02:59:40] ato: Well you don't /need/ them, but they're generally considered faster.
[2014-08-14 02:59:46] ato: (And easier to debug.)
[2014-08-14 03:00:02] WhereIsMySpoon: ? whats the difference
[2014-08-14 03:00:19] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought all stuff used to find elements were selectors
[2014-08-14 03:00:22] WhereIsMySpoon: xpath selectors, css selectors
[2014-08-14 03:00:24] ato: Generally the advice is to use them unless you need to use an XPath only feature, such as visiting a node's ancestor or looking up a node by it's inner text value.
[2014-08-14 03:00:39] ato: The XPath implementations in most browsers suck.
[2014-08-14 03:00:59] ato: And IE doesn't ship with one, and Chromium is considering removing their support for it.
[2014-08-14 03:01:20] ato: As opposed to CSS selectors which are highly optimized for performance.
[2014-08-14 03:01:35] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-14 03:01:45] WhereIsMySpoon: how does xpath work in ie then
[2014-08-14 03:01:47] WhereIsMySpoon: if there is no support
[2014-08-14 03:01:56] WhereIsMySpoon: does webdriver keep a copy of the html and use some sort of html parser?
[2014-08-14 03:02:06] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 831
[2014-08-14 03:02:19] ato: We inject a JS library and have that parse the expression.
[2014-08-14 03:02:23] ato: I think it's called Sizzle.
[2014-08-14 03:02:34] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-14 03:03:00] WhereIsMySpoon: how come chromium is considering removing theirs?
[2014-08-14 03:03:21] ato: Last I heard they were considering removing XML altogether to make their implementation simpler.
[2014-08-14 03:03:48] ato: And support XML through a JS renderer extension on top of their HTML5 parser.
[2014-08-14 03:03:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: what do you mean "removing xml"
[2014-08-14 03:04:01] WhereIsMySpoon: removing support for xml only attrs in html?
[2014-08-14 03:04:25] ato: So a valid XML document triggers a strict mode parser, as opposed to a non-valid which triggers quirks mode.
[2014-08-14 03:04:45] ato: Supporting the strict code path significantly increases the complexity of their parser, or so I gather.
[2014-08-14 03:04:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-14 03:05:06] ato: I should mention that I know only what I've read on blink-dev@.
[2014-08-14 03:05:07] WhereIsMySpoon: why does anyone care about valid xml in a html doc?
[2014-08-14 03:05:09] ato: So I'm no expert.
[2014-08-14 03:05:39] ato: That's not possible, it's either valid XML or HTML.
[2014-08-14 03:05:49] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-08-14 03:05:54] WhereIsMySpoon: then
[2014-08-14 03:05:57] WhereIsMySpoon: why does anyone care about xml
[2014-08-14 03:06:02] ato: No one does. d-:
[2014-08-14 03:06:08] wilhelm_: ato: It is possible, actually.
[2014-08-14 03:06:11] WhereIsMySpoon: im so confused
[2014-08-14 03:06:18] ato: (Unless you're WebDriver or some big bank.)
[2014-08-14 03:06:36] wilhelm_: http://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/ <- brace for madness
[2014-08-14 03:06:51] ato: wilhelm_: To have invalid XML in strict mode?  You mean parser fail?
[2014-08-14 03:07:06] WhereIsMySpoon: oh...xhtml
[2014-08-14 03:07:09] WhereIsMySpoon: who uses that still?
[2014-08-14 03:07:10] wilhelm_: To write a document that is both valid XML and HTML.
[2014-08-14 03:07:25] ato: 17 July 2014
[2014-08-14 03:07:32] ato: What IS this madness
[2014-08-14 03:07:32] wilhelm_: There is no point whatsoever in doing so. But it is possible. There's even a spec.
[2014-08-14 03:07:46] ato: Is Polyglot Markup implemented?
[2014-08-14 03:08:17] wilhelm_: Yes.
[2014-08-14 03:08:29] wilhelm_: Since everyone and their dog used to serve XHTML as text/html
[2014-08-14 03:08:45] ato: «It is sometimes valuable to be able to serve HTML5 documents that are also well formed XML documents. An author may, for example, use XML tools to generate a document, and they and others may process the document using XML tools.»
[2014-08-14 03:08:55] ato: Well that's not an unreasonable use case actually.
[2014-08-14 03:08:56] wilhelm_: Which is, essentially, invalid HTML.
[2014-08-14 03:09:06] ato: I do this, actually.  For sny.no.
[2014-08-14 03:09:10] wilhelm_: You're mad.
[2014-08-14 03:09:14] WhereIsMySpoon: sny.no?
[2014-08-14 03:09:23] ato: <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat">
[2014-08-14 03:09:33] ato: So this is HTML5 compat mode in XSLT.
[2014-08-14 03:09:33] WhereIsMySpoon: what the crap is that
[2014-08-14 03:09:47] ato: So essentially XHTML served as HTML.
[2014-08-14 03:10:14] wilhelm_: XSLT. Remind me to slap you when we meet next time.
[2014-08-14 03:10:33] ato: wilhelm_: Oh well this spec makes perfect sense actually.  It's a formalization of what various XSLT parsers have been doing for many years.
[2014-08-14 03:11:10] wilhelm_: Yes, it makes sense in a discourse where XSLT is paid any attention to.
[2014-08-14 03:11:15] ato: Let's not have another debate about XSLT.  You know it's a perfectly fine templating language.
[2014-08-14 03:11:18] wilhelm_: That's not a discourse I'm involved in.
[2014-08-14 03:11:20] wilhelm_: Noo!
[2014-08-14 03:11:42] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused
[2014-08-14 03:11:42] WhereIsMySpoon:           <td><xsl:value-of select="title"/></td>
[2014-08-14 03:11:47] WhereIsMySpoon: what does this xsl:value-of do
[2014-08-14 03:12:08] wilhelm_: WhereIsMySpoon: Murder small children in their sleep.
[2014-08-14 03:12:22] WhereIsMySpoon: xD
[2014-08-14 03:12:36] wilhelm_: Or strangles kittens. I can't remember which. Something bad.
[2014-08-14 03:12:50] WhereIsMySpoon: oh wait
[2014-08-14 03:12:50] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-14 03:13:01] WhereIsMySpoon: this is kinda like freemarker
[2014-08-14 03:13:03] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: It fetches the value of the variable title.
[2014-08-14 03:13:34] ato: This is a good XSLT example: http://git.sny.no/sny.no/tree/layout/base.xsl
[2014-08-14 03:14:15] ato: You can define a template for a source document which you can massage and fetch only parts of if you wish.
[2014-08-14 03:14:43] ato: Or one which produces an Atom feed (XML): http://git.sny.no/sny.no/tree/layout/feed.xsl
[2014-08-14 03:15:22] WhereIsMySpoon: massage?
[2014-08-14 03:15:23] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-08-14 03:16:17] wilhelm_: "Sacrifice goats to".
[2014-08-14 03:17:34] ato: wilhelm_: Let's be clear: I think XHTML was a disastrous idea, but I don't think XSLT deserves all the criticism it gets.  It's a perfectly apt tool for manipulating XML and making really mind-boggling recursive templates.
[2014-08-14 03:17:53] WhereIsMySpoon: making stuff mind-boggling is necessarily a good idea
[2014-08-14 03:17:54] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-08-14 03:18:00] WhereIsMySpoon: isnt*
[2014-08-14 03:18:18] ato: Well true, you can get carried away.
[2014-08-14 03:19:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont really understand that example ato
[2014-08-14 03:19:08] WhereIsMySpoon: but ok
[2014-08-14 03:19:53] ato: I mean, it's XML.  You're not supposed to get it.
[2014-08-14 03:20:41] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-14 03:20:45] WhereIsMySpoon: useful
[2014-08-14 03:26:18] wilhelm_: ato: It comes from a culture of complexitiy. It is complex and verbose. I don't like it. (c:

[2014-08-14 06:13:22] adamsss: Hello. I'm having issues with testing my firefox extension with selenium. I want to test the popup window. I cant do that with selenium but i can access the popup page from the browser window, but if i do so i cant communicate with the background page, which leads to zero functionality.
[2014-08-14 06:13:36] adamsss: Is there anyone with e2e testing firefox extensions?
[2014-08-14 06:13:48] WhereIsMySpoon: adamsss: if you want to communicate with new tabs or windows, you need to switch to them
[2014-08-14 06:14:02] WhereIsMySpoon: if you then want to communicate with the original tab/window, you need to switch back
[2014-08-14 06:14:14] WhereIsMySpoon: driver.switchTo().window("name") in java
[2014-08-14 06:14:18] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-14 06:14:23] adamsss: Yes. So the problem is not selenium in this case.
[2014-08-14 06:14:41] adamsss: Even without the selenium test i cant access the popup page.
[2014-08-14 06:14:42] WhereIsMySpoon: as far as I can tell from what you've explained to me
[2014-08-14 06:14:50] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-08-14 06:14:52] adamsss: I'll be back soon
[2014-08-14 06:14:55] WhereIsMySpoon: wait
[2014-08-14 06:14:56] WhereIsMySpoon: hang on
[2014-08-14 06:14:58] adamsss: ok
[2014-08-14 06:15:09] WhereIsMySpoon: you're saying that this extension opens a popup page
[2014-08-14 06:15:19] WhereIsMySpoon: with normal browsing
[2014-08-14 06:15:30] WhereIsMySpoon: then when you yourself try to interact with the original page, you cant?
[2014-08-14 06:15:34] adamsss: No, ohh sorry for the lack of explaination.
[2014-08-14 06:15:44] WhereIsMySpoon: [14:14] <adamsss> Even without the selenium test i cant access the popup page.
[2014-08-14 06:15:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ok..now im confused

[2014-08-14 06:16:49] adamsss: sooo When i say the popup page i dont mean an actual popup, but rather a popup in extension context. Which means the window that pops up when you click on the extension icon in firefox
[2014-08-14 06:17:19] adamsss: Does that make sense?

[2014-08-14 06:17:37] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe i can try i tout
[2014-08-14 06:17:58] WhereIsMySpoon: but it sounds like you hjave a problem with the extension
[2014-08-14 06:18:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ratehr than selenium
[2014-08-14 06:18:11] adamsss: It's unfortunately not available. But every extension that you can click on firefox
[2014-08-14 06:18:29] adamsss: you get something called a popup window,
[2014-08-14 06:18:44] adamsss: when you click on adblock plus, you get some stats in the popup windo

[2014-08-14 11:22:56] cryzed: it's possible that some links aren't displayed but still contained in the DOM

[2014-08-14 11:47:07] jimevans: AutomatedTester: when you're about, i need a quick discussion re: cookies in the spec.
[2014-08-14 11:48:01] goosemo: some of it is glibc version releate, others are that in removing the gecko-2 sdk req no compilations of the xdls have worked since febuary when it was removed
[2014-08-14 11:48:54] jimevans: or, of course, simonstewart, you're welcome to weigh in also.

[2014-08-14 11:49:47] simonstewart: You’d be right :)
[2014-08-14 11:49:55] jimevans: goosemo: s/no compilations of the xdls/no compilations of the xdls on linux/
[2014-08-14 11:50:05] jimevans: there. if fixed it for you.
[2014-08-14 11:50:32] goosemo: jimevans: well anything that tries to run the xpidl tool fails jimevans so I don't know if that *nix only
[2014-08-14 11:51:23] jimevans: simonstewart: it seems the section of the spec that deals with cookies only tangentially matches what current implementations do.
[2014-08-14 11:51:41] simonstewart: “yay”
[2014-08-14 11:52:06] goosemo: in that the path that's being called inthe rake script 'third_party/gecko-2/sdk/bin/xpidl' no longer exists at build time, so they always fall back to the precompiled xdls
[2014-08-14 11:52:27] simonstewart: That seems suboptimal
[2014-08-14 11:52:31] goosemo: and the issue never bubbles up
[2014-08-14 11:53:04] jimevans: simonstewart: was that suboptimal for me?
[2014-08-14 11:53:17] simonstewart: Nope. For goosemo.
[2014-08-14 11:53:25] jimevans: ah thought so
[2014-08-14 11:53:35] lukeis: yeah, that does appear to be suboptimal
[2014-08-14 11:53:46] goosemo: yeah, a little. took a bit of digging to find this out :/
[2014-08-14 11:54:00] lukeis: thanks… want to submit a patch? :)
[2014-08-14 11:54:13] goosemo: i've been able to fix the issue locally, but used the xlurunner-31 sdk
[2014-08-14 11:54:16] lukeis: i'd gladly apply it (assuming things 'build')
[2014-08-14 11:54:39] goosemo: but i think i can use the gecko-# sdks similarly
[2014-08-14 11:54:48] lukeis: everyone would love to toss this native events thing out the window :)
[2014-08-14 11:54:51] jimevans: the root cause of the problem stems from the "be able to actually release from any machine, no matter what the platform" (which is why there are prebuilt binaries in the tree anyway)
[2014-08-14 11:55:03] *jimevans mutters something about marionette'
[2014-08-14 11:55:09] goosemo: yeah I was planning on submitting a patch :D
[2014-08-14 11:55:15] lukeis: jimevans: yep, and masks issues like this…
[2014-08-14 11:55:35] goosemo: right i think that's all good. I may als try and add a flag to fail on native event compilation
[2014-08-14 11:55:43] lukeis: since I've never once actually built absolutely everything (always get fall-backs)
[2014-08-14 11:55:47] goosemo: which might catch this case in the future
[2014-08-14 11:56:10] jimevans: goosemo: that's going to break a lot of stuff.
[2014-08-14 11:56:18] lukeis: honest truth goosemo, i don't use native events in firefox :)
[2014-08-14 11:56:27] lukeis: neither do most of the heavy users
[2014-08-14 11:56:33] jimevans: i can't build, for example, the .NET bindings, without prebuilt versions of the linux shared libs.
[2014-08-14 11:56:45] jimevans: but whatever
[2014-08-14 11:57:01] goosemo: jimevans: a flag? i'd make it's default the current state. and allow one to turn on the need to compilation every time
[2014-08-14 11:57:07] goosemo: oh
[2014-08-14 11:57:09] goosemo: true
[2014-08-14 11:57:24] goosemo: lukeis: I use it for flash clicks
[2014-08-14 11:58:18] jimevans: for the record, i believe that marionette will eventually break that hack for flash testing in firefox (but i'm not sure about that)
[2014-08-14 11:58:32] jimevans: in other words, it'll one day no longer work.
[2014-08-14 11:58:37] goosemo: i'm unfamiliar with what you're talking about
[2014-08-14 11:58:52] jimevans: there is a version of the firefox driver, written by mozilla, called marionette.
[2014-08-14 11:59:02] jimevans: when it reaches 1.0, it will be the firefox driver.
[2014-08-14 11:59:05] jimevans: full stop
[2014-08-14 11:59:19] garndt: those whacky mozilla people and marionette!
[2014-08-14 11:59:25] jimevans: it does not have a "native events/synthetic events" toggle.
[2014-08-14 11:59:28] lukeis: well, i'm sure motivated individuals could use the old one if they wanted to :)
[2014-08-14 11:59:44] lukeis: but we're not going to make it easy for them ;)
[2014-08-14 11:59:49] jimevans: if you're clicking random locations on the screen, webdriver isn't the right tool.
[2014-08-14 12:00:14] jimevans: (and clicking parts of flash animations is tantamount to clicking random locations on the screen)
[2014-08-14 12:00:49] lukeis: yeah, java robot would be better for that ;)
[2014-08-14 12:00:55] jimevans: but what do i know? i'm just this guy. my opinions don't matter much after all.
[2014-08-14 12:00:56] goosemo: using the grid though webdriver is the only way to go though

[2014-08-14 12:01:54] ato: Marionette, isn't that vapourware?

[2014-08-14 12:02:39] goosemo: lukeis: I don't see this feature documented?
[2014-08-14 12:02:42] jimevans: as long as there's a w3c spec, and mozilla cares about following specs, i hold out hope, no matter how remote, that we will eventually see a 1.0 release of marionette.
[2014-08-14 12:02:42] *ato gives lukeis a Firefox OS device'
[2014-08-14 12:02:45] ato: lukeis: Look it works there!
[2014-08-14 12:03:44] ato: We'll get there.
[2014-08-14 12:03:47] jimevans: of course, i marvel at the irony that microsoft is farther toward a released implementation than mozilla. :-P
[2014-08-14 12:03:52] garndt: heh
[2014-08-14 12:03:53] lukeis: goosemo: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial/wiki/Tutorial
[2014-08-14 12:05:25] jimevans: so anyway, simonstewart, the spec only offers getCookie and addCookie, where getCookie can pass an optional name, and the behavior when not passed a name is undefined in the spec.
[2014-08-14 12:06:00] simonstewart: That’s less than ideal. Sounds like some work needs to be done
[2014-08-14 12:06:11] lukeis: no name should be "getCookies"
[2014-08-14 12:06:21] lukeis: but should be explicitly stated :)
[2014-08-14 12:09:04] jimevans: my problem is i'm fighting between implementations here. it's virtually impossible to reconcile
