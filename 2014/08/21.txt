[2014-08-21 01:56:01] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: try a different driver version?
[2014-08-21 01:56:12] WhereIsMySpoon: does it happen whenever you try a css selector?
[2014-08-21 01:56:17] WhereIsMySpoon: or just with a specific selecto
[2014-08-21 01:56:18] WhereIsMySpoon: r

[2014-08-21 02:10:36] Dave_B_: they'll probably want to know your chrome version & a sample html page
[2014-08-21 02:10:58] Dave_B_: (does the same happen if you use a css selector on another site like google?)

[2014-08-21 02:26:57] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: what Dave said is important actually - it could be that your page has some weird stuff on it
[2014-08-21 02:27:25] WhereIsMySpoon: try the selector with a stupidly simple html page like <html><head></head><body><div id="header"></div></body></html>
[2014-08-21 02:30:20] JustMozzy: That narrowed it down. when I open google it works. there are a lot of elements and scripts on the page that I want to test. it would be probably too much to post on the issue ticket. as for the os and browser versions, they are in the selenium debug dump I posted.
[2014-08-21 02:30:38] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: ok so first thing: is the element inside an iframe?
[2014-08-21 02:30:45] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2014-08-21 02:30:55] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: can we have the sample html?
[2014-08-21 02:30:56] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: Wait, I'll post at least the html of it
[2014-08-21 02:30:58] WhereIsMySpoon: on your page
[2014-08-21 02:31:01] WhereIsMySpoon: please
[2014-08-21 02:31:03] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-21 02:31:21] WhereIsMySpoon: also i just googled and dont see any issues with the selector
[2014-08-21 02:31:46] WhereIsMySpoon: though "max call stack size" is a bit of a weird error to get if its actually a code issue
[2014-08-21 02:32:06] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 822
[2014-08-21 02:32:12] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd normally expect an error like that to be an issue with the library/framework/whatever im working with
[2014-08-21 02:34:07] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: maybe the page I am trying to test is exceptional in that case ;)
[2014-08-21 02:34:20] JustMozzy: sorry it is taking long. I have to remove some data from the html

[2014-08-21 02:38:58] JustMozzy: hmmm
[2014-08-21 02:39:17] JustMozzy: ok, so I noticed invalid markup (duplicated #header)
[2014-08-21 02:40:28] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-21 02:40:31] WhereIsMySpoon: that will be a problem
[2014-08-21 02:40:55] WhereIsMySpoon: to be honest though, it still shouldnt result in a stack overflow
[2014-08-21 02:41:22] JustMozzy: I just tested it in a simple page with only two divs carrying the id header. test passed
[2014-08-21 02:41:29] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd still submit a bug report, maybe with <html><head></head><body><div id="header"></div><div id="header"></div></body></html>
[2014-08-21 02:41:39] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, so that doesnt break it?
[2014-08-21 02:41:52] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-21 02:42:01] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe with them nested?

[2014-08-21 02:42:26] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno
[2014-08-21 02:42:50] WhereIsMySpoon: i still cant see your html so :)
[2014-08-21 02:43:03] WhereIsMySpoon: however they are ordered in your html, try the same with a simple page
[2014-08-21 02:44:01] JustMozzy: here is the markup (finally) https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/attachmentText?id=7776&aid=77760001000&name=home.htm&token=ABZ6GAc9tdIZFP9ZSrN7BWwx35ZlFyBYGw%3A1408614205202
[2014-08-21 02:44:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ack, IE comments
[2014-08-21 02:44:40] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: not really pretty markup, I know
[2014-08-21 02:44:55] JustMozzy: but the other drivers, (FF and IE) have no problem with the page
[2014-08-21 02:45:14] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: try what I suggested
[2014-08-21 02:45:18] WhereIsMySpoon: with the nested divs
[2014-08-21 02:45:23] WhereIsMySpoon: and see if you get that stack overflow
[2014-08-21 02:45:34] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: tried it out. test passed
[2014-08-21 02:45:39] WhereIsMySpoon: blerh
[2014-08-21 02:46:03] WhereIsMySpoon: holy freakin crap
[2014-08-21 02:46:19] *WhereIsMySpoon has spotted the gigantic block of javascript at the bottom'
[2014-08-21 02:46:35] JustMozzy: hehe
[2014-08-21 02:46:39] WhereIsMySpoon: i hope you arent relying on those "app constants" for anyhting importnat
[2014-08-21 02:46:53] WhereIsMySpoon: i could easily change them with a html inspector
[2014-08-21 02:47:55] WhereIsMySpoon: eh well...i dont think anyone is really going to want to look at this html
[2014-08-21 02:47:57] WhereIsMySpoon: its huge
[2014-08-21 02:48:03] WhereIsMySpoon: and not very nice :p
[2014-08-21 02:48:11] JustMozzy: hehe, I know. it is a mess
[2014-08-21 02:48:34] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy: so if you change the header id to be unique does it all work?
[2014-08-21 02:50:25] JustMozzy: WhereIsMySpoon: unfortunately no :(
[2014-08-21 02:50:39] JustMozzy: maybe there is just too much javascript for the chromedriver to handle
[2014-08-21 02:53:33] WhereIsMySpoon: oh for the love of all that is goddamn holy
[2014-08-21 02:53:36] WhereIsMySpoon: its fine
[2014-08-21 02:53:39] WhereIsMySpoon: we dont need unique ids
[2014-08-21 02:53:39] WhereIsMySpoon: nope
[2014-08-21 02:53:41] WhereIsMySpoon: no issue here
[2014-08-21 02:53:47] WhereIsMySpoon: *tablef*ckingflip*
[2014-08-21 02:54:19] WhereIsMySpoon: if it's 'display:none' it doesnt count as being in the dom right?

[2014-08-21 03:28:17] JustMozzy_: I could just now confirm that the huge amount of javascript included in the page is the reason for the chromedriver to rasie a maximum call stack error.
[2014-08-21 03:29:44] WhereIsMySpoon: nice
[2014-08-21 03:30:06] WhereIsMySpoon: thats something to raise an issue about, but I can tell you now it wont be high priority
[2014-08-21 03:30:17] WhereIsMySpoon: you should look at reducing your js usage
[2014-08-21 03:30:34] WhereIsMySpoon: especially since you have part of your page dedicated to users without it
[2014-08-21 03:30:44] WhereIsMySpoon: unless i was mistaken
[2014-08-21 03:31:08] JustMozzy_: WhereIsMySpoon: What about sites built with angular or similar frameworks? I wish I could reduce javascript and css usage... this project is just a mess. the noscript part of the page is just to tell people that the site won't work without
[2014-08-21 03:31:28] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy_: we have quite a bit of js on our app...I've never had any issues
[2014-08-21 03:31:31] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont know what angular is
[2014-08-21 03:31:46] WhereIsMySpoon: css usage is fine

[2014-08-21 03:32:47] WhereIsMySpoon: JustMozzy_: one thing you could do is reduce the number of imported js scripts and only import them when they're needed
[2014-08-21 03:34:14] WhereIsMySpoon: that should be fairly simple
[2014-08-21 03:35:30] JustMozzy_: WhereIsMySpoon: it is. like to many other things I have suggested during the project. all got rejected because "there is no time"... trust me I have suffered while building this piece of markup crap. narrowed the error down to just one javascript file

[2014-08-21 03:53:59] JustMozzy_: it doesn't make sense though, that a maximum call stack error is raised. when I open the page with chrome everything seems to be fine. maybe the driver goes nuts with extending the array object.

[2014-08-21 08:25:07] WhereIsMySpoon: however upon googling it seems that you need to turn UAC off and give Ranorex admin privileges
[2014-08-21 08:25:48] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-21 08:26:08] Guest7079: yeah it's getting it to run without the privileges i am wondering about
[2014-08-21 08:26:25] Guest7079: it will notify you if it isnt run as admin, and will not play/record tests
[2014-08-21 08:26:38] Guest7079: the issue i have is our product cannot be run as admin or else it locks up
[2014-08-21 08:27:02] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2014-08-21 08:27:04] Guest7079: and when ranorex starts our application, while being run as admin, the same issue occurs
[2014-08-21 08:27:26] WhereIsMySpoon: nothing we can do here sorry :)
[2014-08-21 08:27:28] Guest7079: so im trying to see if it can be run without admin rights :)
[2014-08-21 08:27:37] WhereIsMySpoon: try googling
[2014-08-21 08:27:46] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe theres a mailing list or forum for it
[2014-08-21 08:28:08] Guest7079: i have been looking without much luck
[2014-08-21 08:28:08] [1]JP: Wait, your product stops working with admin privileges? Isn't it normally the other way around?

[2014-08-21 09:00:41] WhereIsMySpoon: or do they still have to pick who is actually on it
[2014-08-21 09:00:54] WhereIsMySpoon: Ive never done duty before
[2014-08-21 09:01:07] lukeis: here you start in a 'jury pool'
[2014-08-21 09:01:18] WhereIsMySpoon: ah ok
[2014-08-21 09:01:26] jimevans: like that mostly everywhere.
[2014-08-21 09:01:28] lukeis: and then they call in people from this pool to potentially be on a case
[2014-08-21 09:01:41] WhereIsMySpoon: guess that makes sense, would be a bit silly if they invited the exact number of people cause im sure some cant show up
[2014-08-21 09:01:45] lukeis: and then eliminate from those to pick the members for a case ;)
[2014-08-21 09:01:46] WhereIsMySpoon: for whatever resaon
[2014-08-21 09:01:48] WhereIsMySpoon: reason*
[2014-08-21 09:01:53] jimevans: the attorneys in any case haven't had the opportunity to put the potential jury members through voir dire.
[2014-08-21 09:02:04] WhereIsMySpoon: what are the criteria they use to eliminate people?

[2014-08-21 09:03:45] lukeis: professor*
[2014-08-21 09:03:58] jimevans: depending on the jurisdiction, an attorney can eliminate a potential jury member for any reason at all (preemptory challenge), or for cause (real or perceived bias, lack of ability to understand the case, whatever). the number of challenges can be capped per attorney (both prosecution and defense get to remove potential jurors).

[2014-08-21 09:04:39] WhereIsMySpoon: surely that would make youy more likely to get in
[2014-08-21 09:04:55] WhereIsMySpoon: as you are more in tune with the subject matter
[2014-08-21 09:04:57] WhereIsMySpoon: no?
[2014-08-21 09:05:03] lukeis: heh, unless one side doesn't want someone who knows a lot about this particular subject
[2014-08-21 09:05:07] jimevans: not for the prosecution, who don't want people who know forensics.
[2014-08-21 09:05:15] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-08-21 09:05:22] WhereIsMySpoon: why would the court allow that
[2014-08-21 09:05:32] lukeis: welcome to the justice system!
[2014-08-21 09:05:33] WhereIsMySpoon: "yes, we'll intentionally allow you people who are less imformed"

[2014-08-21 09:05:50] jimevans: we don't have a justice system. we have a legal system.
[2014-08-21 09:05:55] lukeis: heh ;)
[2014-08-21 09:06:10] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont even
[2014-08-21 09:06:11] jimevans: and for lawyers, it's all about winning the case.
[2014-08-21 09:06:14] jimevans: full stop.
[2014-08-21 09:06:23] lukeis: and I get to inform them of my bias that I think the legal system is extremely flawed from past experience…. i got to check that box in my form ;)
[2014-08-21 09:06:31] WhereIsMySpoon: haha
[2014-08-21 09:06:51] jimevans: and whatever will give them the advantage to do that (usually within the law), they'll take it.
[2014-08-21 09:06:55] WhereIsMySpoon: so does the prosecution see these forms?
[2014-08-21 09:07:00] lukeis: yes
[2014-08-21 09:07:01] WhereIsMySpoon: and they pick and choose who to have on the hury
[2014-08-21 09:07:04] WhereIsMySpoon: jury
[2014-08-21 09:07:06] WhereIsMySpoon: thats fucked up
[2014-08-21 09:07:06] lukeis: yes
[2014-08-21 09:07:11] lukeis: yes
[2014-08-21 09:07:12] WhereIsMySpoon: what the hell
[2014-08-21 09:07:13] jimevans: that's the only way it's fair
[2014-08-21 09:07:19] WhereIsMySpoon: what?
[2014-08-21 09:07:23] lukeis: welcome to Ah' muricka
[2014-08-21 09:07:23] WhereIsMySpoon: why doesnt hte judge choose
[2014-08-21 09:07:25] jimevans: both sides have to have access to exactly the same information.
[2014-08-21 09:07:49] WhereIsMySpoon: they do, the jury is impartial
[2014-08-21 09:07:59] WhereIsMySpoon: doesnt matter what info members of the jury have
[2014-08-21 09:08:04] lukeis: there is no such thing as an impartial jury
[2014-08-21 09:08:11] jimevans: because the defendant has the right to "a jury of his or her peers", and the only person who can actually determine that is the defendant (or his or her representative)
[2014-08-21 09:08:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, in legal terms and in theory, its supposed to be
[2014-08-21 09:08:25] lukeis: yeah, but in reality, that doesn't exist
[2014-08-21 09:08:32] *lukeis past experience :)'
[2014-08-21 09:08:47] WhereIsMySpoon: and the prosecution doesnt have a right to a jury of his or her peesr?
[2014-08-21 09:08:50] WhereIsMySpoon: peers
[2014-08-21 09:09:02] lukeis: prosecution, heck no!
[2014-08-21 09:09:02] jimevans: no. the prosecution isn't on trial (in a criminal case)
[2014-08-21 09:09:04] vilmos, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-21 09:09:07] lukeis: defense, yes ;)
[2014-08-21 09:09:14] lukeis: but then there's also civil cases…. yuck
[2014-08-21 09:09:28] WhereIsMySpoon: surely the defense has an inherant advantage then
[2014-08-21 09:09:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see why thats fair
[2014-08-21 09:09:39] WhereIsMySpoon: inherent*
[2014-08-21 09:09:40] lukeis: this is only for criminal trials
[2014-08-21 09:09:52] jimevans: "better 100 guilty men go free than a single innocent man convicted"
[2014-08-21 09:09:59] lukeis: it's more likely to serve on a jury for a civil case (two people suing each other)
[2014-08-21 09:10:24] Dave_B_: american legal system is confusing to me (but then, most countries legal systems are probably confusing to foreigners)
[2014-08-21 09:10:25] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: how far do you extend that?
[2014-08-21 09:10:27] WhereIsMySpoon: 1000 people?
[2014-08-21 09:10:30] WhereIsMySpoon: 10000? 100000000?
[2014-08-21 09:10:46] lukeis: you are innocent until proven guilty :)
[2014-08-21 09:10:50] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that's a paraphrase of the exact quote (which i can't find at the moment)
[2014-08-21 09:10:51] WhereIsMySpoon: yes I know that
[2014-08-21 09:10:53] lukeis: emphasis on the prove
[2014-08-21 09:11:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see how having someone with better knowledge of the subject would help innocent people be proven guilty
[2014-08-21 09:11:39] jimevans: the point is that it's better to err on the side of innocence.
[2014-08-21 09:12:07] WhereIsMySpoon: if anythinig its more likely to be the other way around
[2014-08-21 09:12:10] jimevans: i suppose i could come up with a strawman concrete example
[2014-08-21 09:12:25] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2014-08-21 09:12:35] Dave_B_: this country is weird - mostly innocent until proven guilty, unless it's a workplace discrimination case in which case you have to prove you didn't discriminate… bonkers
[2014-08-21 09:12:54] jimevans: Dave_B_: ah, but workplace discrimination is civil, not criminal.
[2014-08-21 09:13:01] jimevans: it's about the burden of proof.

[2014-08-21 09:38:14] jimevans: ato: recommendations?
[2014-08-21 09:38:18] ato: Or roll a very simple tokenizer.
[2014-08-21 09:39:52] jimevans: yeah, i'm thinking that my simple tokenizer is god-awful slow.

[2014-08-21 09:42:54] jimevans: yeah, but i have to prebuild the link lib to use boost. since there's a potential that i'm not the only one to look at this code, i'm not sure i'm prepared for that.
[2014-08-21 09:43:22] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-08-21 09:43:28] jimevans: if the boost regex impl was header-only, like much of the libs, i'd be fine with it.
[2014-08-21 09:43:47] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-21 09:44:01] ato: If it's a webdriver URL, can't you just split on /?
[2014-08-21 09:44:18] ato: Also if you really want regex and you're on C++11 you can use <regex>.

[2014-08-21 13:09:53] jimevans: i haven't thought about it, really. it just occurred to me that we could avoid some headache between spec-compliant and not-spec-compliant if we had two differently-named properties in the json response.
[2014-08-21 13:10:50] jleyba: jimevans: we do
[2014-08-21 13:11:06] jleyba: state: string as defined in spec. status: int as used historically
[2014-08-21 13:11:23] jleyba: if state is not set, java infers its value from status
[2014-08-21 13:11:26] jimevans: i don't recall state being defined in the :spec.

[2014-08-21 13:12:05] jleyba: then it must have been changed b/c simon added state to the java client
[2014-08-21 13:12:11] jimevans: indeed the current editors' draft has status.
[2014-08-21 13:12:18] jimevans: as a string.

[2014-08-21 14:18:47] arcturussage: Hey, I tried searching the google group and couldn't find anything (though my search terms could have been better). I have a relatively simple test using Webdriver for python. There's a bit of code "driver.find_element_by_id("edit-submit--2").click()" that works if the firefox window it creates has focus
[2014-08-21 14:19:17] arcturussage: but if I click away to a different window while the test runs it fails to click that button and fails on the next step
[2014-08-21 14:20:36] arcturussage: The same general code works plenty of times even if the window doesn't have focus "driver.find_element_by_id("edit-multiple-node-menu-enabled").click()" but those are text fields instead of a submit button

[2014-08-21 14:32:29] dude-x: i had to use execute_script to force it to select an option
[2014-08-21 14:32:44] dude-x: didn't like that doing that but otherwise the focus issues will cause the test to fail, which is bizarre
[2014-08-21 14:32:52] arcturussage: The part it's having trouble with is the submit/save button in a drupal template
[2014-08-21 14:33:30] arcturussage: what makes it even more confusing (for me, at least) is that at the start of the program it can successfully click the login/submit button even if the window doesn't have focus
