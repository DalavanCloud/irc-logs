[2014-02-11 05:32:38] winuser2003: is anyone here aware of junit testing? I would like to ask a couple of questions regarding the project I am working. Thank you...
[2014-02-11 05:32:56] barancev|2: :ask
[2014-02-11 05:32:57] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2014-02-11 05:34:47] winuser2003: the question I have is how do I validate links from this website I am testing. There are over 50 and I would like to have the test validate the links and fail if anyone of the links cannot be be validated. I am unsure how to take the approach to doing this in regards to my project
[2014-02-11 05:35:39] winuser2003: I could use a try and catch with an asserttrue, and someone else asked me to build an array, so I am really unsure how to approach this sort of validation
[2014-02-11 05:37:28] barancev|2: what result do you expect to get? "there is a bad link" or "here is a list of bad links: ...."
[2014-02-11 05:37:38] drharmony, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-11 05:38:20] winuser2003: allow the test to keep going reporting bad links within the console
[2014-02-11 05:38:54] winuser2003: so instead of it just stopping on the first bad link and keep re-running the test over and over, it will keep going and I can make the changes in one review as necessary
[2014-02-11 05:39:07] winuser2003: hope that makes sence
[2014-02-11 05:39:49] winuser2003: so to answer your question "here is a lists of bad links"
[2014-02-11 05:40:15] winuser2003: but it also goes a little deeper than validating the links too
[2014-02-11 05:40:28] winuser2003: thats just one part of this test
[2014-02-11 05:40:52] barancev|2: what method do you use to check a single link?

[2014-02-11 05:46:53] barancev|2: so you have to accumulate bad links in catch blocks to an array

[2014-02-11 05:48:42] winuser2003: I think you have to understand more depth about my project though to understand what it is I am trying to do. Also I am unaware how to accumulate bad link in the catch blocks

[2014-02-11 09:07:25] malinus: I need help setting up PhantomJS with selenium, for python on linux. I can't find any info on it, and it seems like nobody has problems simply doing webdrive.PhantomJS, but I don't have the phantomJS module for selenium (phantomjs is installed though).
[2014-02-11 09:08:05] malinus: *but I don't have the phantomJS module in the webdrive module in selenium like everybody else seems to have
[2014-02-11 09:08:21] lukeis: malinus: as long as phantomjs is on the path (command line you should be able to run `phatomjs`) webdriver.PhantomJS() should work
[2014-02-11 09:08:30] lukeis: what version of selenium?
[2014-02-11 09:08:41] lukeis: pip install -U selenium to get the latest
[2014-02-11 09:09:08] malinus: lukeis, I'm not using pip, I'm using my distributions repository, let me check the version
[2014-02-11 09:09:32] lukeis: print webdriver.__version__
[2014-02-11 09:10:07] malinus: lukeis, '2.25.0'
[2014-02-11 09:10:13] lukeis: very old :)
[2014-02-11 09:10:18] malinus: t-thank ubuntu
[2014-02-11 09:10:21] lukeis: 2.39.0 is the latest
[2014-02-11 09:10:22] malinus: *s
[2014-02-11 09:10:41] malinus: lukeis, so I guess phantomjs is simply not added in that version?
[2014-02-11 09:10:47] lukeis: correct
[2014-02-11 09:10:51] lukeis: :changelog

[2014-02-11 09:11:12] lukeis: 2.27 looks like the first
[2014-02-11 09:11:23] malinus: lukeis, okay, thanks I guess I'll get the newest selenium version by using pip or installing by hand.
[2014-02-11 09:11:42] cgoldberg: malinus, are you using the debian/ubuntu packaged version of selenium?
[2014-02-11 09:12:01] malinus: cgoldberg, yes. That is always my initial approach.
[2014-02-11 09:12:08] cgoldberg: it lags the Firefox version and pretty much never works
[2014-02-11 09:12:22] cgoldberg: get the latest from PyPI.. and apt-get remove the repo version :P
[2014-02-11 09:12:38] malinus: cgoldberg, b-but it's stable
[2014-02-11 09:12:39] malinus: ;)
[2014-02-11 09:13:05] cgoldberg: yes.. it works great with a browser version they no longer ship.. rock solid :)

[2014-02-11 17:37:22] jlipps: i have and do, yes
[2014-02-11 17:37:34] mdas: jlipps: Do you have some time to help me out with it?
[2014-02-11 17:37:35] jlipps: mostly in javascript these days, but it's more or less exactly the same
[2014-02-11 17:37:47] mdas: I haven't used it in years and forgot how, but I think it might help us for a particular problem
[2014-02-11 17:38:06] jlipps: basically you hook it up to a twisted reactor or tornado
[2014-02-11 17:38:22] jlipps: what part is bugging you
[2014-02-11 17:39:13] mdas: jlipps: so we have a tornado based websocket server running
[2014-02-11 17:40:15] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-11 17:40:27] jlipps: hmm once upon a time i wrote a monocle websocket server based on tornado
[2014-02-11 17:41:38] mdas: jlipps: if I hit a certain url, the server will kick off a handler, that handler will call some more python, but that python will need to make an async call to the handler, wait for a response, and then will return and then my request will be complete
[2014-02-11 17:41:51] mdas: it's kind of loopy.
[2014-02-11 17:42:08] jlipps: yes indeed
[2014-02-11 17:42:49] mdas: essentially: I ask Handler for something, Handler calls some_module, some_module calls yield handler.some_function(), Handler deals with some_function() and returns, then some_module finishes, then Handler returns something back to me
[2014-02-11 17:43:12] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 737
[2014-02-11 17:43:23] mdas: I have no idea how to set up monocle (if I can) to interact between Handler and some_module
[2014-02-11 17:43:53] mdas: is that something I can do?
[2014-02-11 17:47:00] jlipps: hmmm
[2014-02-11 17:48:00] jlipps: sounds to me like handler.some_function() just needs to be an oroutine
[2014-02-11 17:48:24] jlipps: but this approach sounds strange to begin with
[2014-02-11 17:48:56] mdas: jlipps: agreed, I was wondering about eventloop.run() and how it works. I wasn't sure where to set that up

[2014-02-11 17:50:36] mdas: my question is, in a server that creates a new handler object (which seems to be a thread) per connection, and that object calls a function taht is an oroutine, will eventloop be able to pick that up?
[2014-02-11 17:50:49] mdas: I guess I'll keep playing around
[2014-02-11 17:51:16] jlipps: mdas:  here's my example
[2014-02-11 17:51:17] jlipps: https://gist.github.com/jlipps/42862a46a27a5bdf8912
[2014-02-11 17:51:27] jlipps: it has the example monocle interface to tornado's websocket server
[2014-02-11 17:51:37] jlipps: and then the example monocle websocket server you can build with that
[2014-02-11 17:51:50] jlipps: if you go with that architecture it might be easier to figure out where to put the various calls
[2014-02-11 17:52:44] mdas: jlipps: you are a gentleman and a scholar.
[2014-02-11 17:52:45] mdas: thank you
[2014-02-11 17:52:53] mdas: this should help me out quite a bit
[2014-02-11 17:53:05] jlipps: mdas:  hmm wait a sec
[2014-02-11 17:53:09] jlipps: looks like that might be in the middle of a rebase

[2014-02-11 18:10:32] jlipps: but anyway, this is about as much as i think i can help without digging into the details of your setup
[2014-02-11 18:10:53] kandinski: I'm using selenium to scrape a file. The documentation explains how to set up a Firefox profile so downloads are done automatically ('browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk'), but I can't find how to do the same thing with PhantomJS
[2014-02-11 18:11:16] jlipps: mdas:  _add is basically the thing that adds your service to the eventloop
[2014-02-11 18:11:33] jlipps: so it's what needs to make sure that your server gets hooked in with the same event loop monocle is running on
[2014-02-11 18:11:36] jlipps: i think?

[2014-02-11 18:19:05] mdas: jlipps: I seem to have gotten that far, but I;m fumbling when it comes to using yield
[2014-02-11 18:19:07] mdas: gimme a sec
[2014-02-11 18:22:33] jlipps: you yield an oroutine, and in an oroutine, you yield Return(xxx) whatever the result is
[2014-02-11 18:22:43] jlipps: that's it!
[2014-02-11 18:23:44] mdas: jlipps: so, I appear to be complicating things by adding unittest in the mix. Let me take a step back and explain the craziness.
[2014-02-11 18:24:36] mdas: We want to have a websocket server which, when we hit a url, will run a bunch of unittests (serverside) and will prompt the user for data *during* a test.
[2014-02-11 18:25:24] mdas: So this is what's going on so far: https://gist.github.com/malini/8948822, the first file kicks off the server, the second file is the server code but the only important bit is https://gist.github.com/malini/8948822#file-gistfile2-py-L114 where we invoke unittest
[2014-02-11 18:25:41] mdas: and the last file is the test in which I'd like to be able to yield
[2014-02-11 18:28:44] mdas: it dies on line 10 with *** AttributeError: 'TestSms' object has no attribute 'io_loop' , which is odd since this line is from tornado.testing which I'm not using... So. Weird things are happening in this weird architecture. Not surprising
[2014-02-11 18:28:47] jlipps: mdas:  yeah i'm not sure this is possible.
[2014-02-11 18:29:00] jlipps: you need to `yield test_send_sms()`
[2014-02-11 18:29:11] jlipps: but unittest is not going to do that for you
[2014-02-11 18:30:02] jlipps: unless you rewrite unittest so you can do something like:
[2014-02-11 18:30:12] jlipps: yield unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)
[2014-02-11 18:30:37] jlipps: i.e., you'd need a new kind of unittest runner which knows that its methods are oroutines
[2014-02-11 18:31:28] mdas: hmmmmmm
[2014-02-11 18:32:15] mdas: we're short on time, but that's what the ideal control flow would be
[2014-02-11 18:33:55] mdas: tempting.

[2014-02-11 18:38:08] mdas: jlipps: if I were to write a unittest runner that could deal with orountines, what would I need to do? Say it looks something like this https://etherpad.mozilla.org/R8InJlagEY

[2014-02-11 18:41:08] jlipps: you might need to go the service route
[2014-02-11 18:41:21] jlipps: i.e., somehow have unittests have an _add that hook things up to the eventloop

[2014-02-11 22:08:50] nlh: Hi, what is the best way to specify an error message for a test which fails due to a call to find_element_by_id('non-existent-id')?
[2014-02-11 22:10:39] sam_____: how to run selenium code on linux platform  ?
[2014-02-11 22:12:43] nlh: i.e. I want to check that a specific element exists on a page - I can currently do this by simply calling find_element_by_id('element-id') but then the error message gets lost in the traceback (I'm running the python implementation).
