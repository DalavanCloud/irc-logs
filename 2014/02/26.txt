[2014-02-26 03:54:03] Dave_B_: about the best i could think of was to roll your own method to look for the alert and catch the exception yourself rather than using fluentwaits ignored exceptions thing

[2014-02-26 03:55:38] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: the best way to learn is by doing
[2014-02-26 03:55:42] WhereIsMySpoon: for programming at least
[2014-02-26 03:56:04] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: having lots of small nuggets of knowledge about quirks or people doing stuff wrong isnt all that useful

[2014-02-26 04:01:08] ttyp0: not everyone everywhere is jaded and cynical ;)
[2014-02-26 04:01:37] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: getting harder to see

[2014-02-26 04:02:12] ttyp0: nothing wrong with cynicism btw, as long as it's in check. in the right places and in the right doses a little bit of cynicism is only enjoyable - even fun.
[2014-02-26 04:02:20] Dave_B_: true, but many programming channels are stressful to post gists to as you'll get abused for the next 30 minutes for not following a naming convention or something. In here it's mostly more chilled
[2014-02-26 04:02:34] ttyp0: but not in the amounts that you sometimes get on these jaded and cynical channels (and elsewhere)
