[2014-02-18 07:05:17] jimevans: there's really not a lot of rocket science as to what the .net bindings do.

[2014-02-18 07:06:18] fuppinshire1: it's 1 line of code

[2014-02-18 07:06:21] fuppinshire1: Driver = new OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeDriver();
[2014-02-18 07:06:36] fuppinshire1: pretty much what you'd expect
[2014-02-18 07:06:41] jimevans: and what exception are you getting?
[2014-02-18 07:08:35] jimevans: let's talk about what the .net code is doing under the covers. it launches chromedriver.exe, using a command-line option for the executable to listen on a (randomly selected) free port. the bindings then start pinging that port with http requests, waiting for the http server that chromedriver.exe starts up to be ready and processing requests. once that's done, the bindings send the command to launch chrome. what we don't know yet is where that process
[2014-02-18 07:08:38] fuppinshire1: right now it's eating the detail
[2014-02-18 07:08:41] fuppinshire1: so all I see is Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
[2014-02-18 07:08:49] fuppinshire1: after I put the code fix in for that I can tell you
[2014-02-18 07:08:52] rod_96, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 07:09:02] fuppinshire1: what was happening before that created this behavior was some boxes didn't have chrome installed on them correctly
[2014-02-18 07:09:54] fuppinshire1: these chromedrivers are being launched by a service that will shut them down if they've been open for too long, but the only instance where that doesn't happen is when it doesn't initialize correctly, which is how I've narrowed it down
[2014-02-18 07:10:06] jimevans: i'm not sure what you mean by "eating the detail"
[2014-02-18 07:10:23] jimevans: also, using windows services. there be dragons.
[2014-02-18 07:10:28] fuppinshire1: yea :(
[2014-02-18 07:10:35] fuppinshire1: it's eating the stack
[2014-02-18 07:10:37] fuppinshire1: like uuuh
[2014-02-18 07:10:39] fuppinshire1: the reporting tool
[2014-02-18 07:10:46] fuppinshire1: is only capturing the "Exception has been thrown by target" crap
[2014-02-18 07:10:57] fuppinshire1: and not capturing the good stuff which is whatever invalidoperationexception or whatever is happening
[2014-02-18 07:10:58] jimevans: so you're not actually debugging it or running it as a user-mode process
[2014-02-18 07:11:08] fuppinshire1: no, can't on those boxes
[2014-02-18 07:11:14] fuppinshire1: and I can't reproduce on the boxes I can debug on
[2014-02-18 07:11:19] fuppinshire1: it always launches it just fine
[2014-02-18 07:11:19] jimevans: yep. we're done here.
[2014-02-18 07:11:29] fuppinshire1: so... demon magic?
[2014-02-18 07:12:03] jimevans: in most cases, you can't expect desktop-interacting applications to behave properly when launched from the context of a windows service.
[2014-02-18 07:12:14] jimevans: windows services aren't like regular user-mode processes
[2014-02-18 07:12:21] fuppinshire1: I know
[2014-02-18 07:12:33] jimevans: and yet, you're expecting exactly that.
[2014-02-18 07:13:48] fuppinshire1: I feel like if it was actually that it wouldn't work 95% of the time through Chrome and 100% of the time through PhantomJS or Firefox

[2014-02-18 07:14:28] jimevans: the IE driver is particularly susceptible to problems when you attempt to run it from a windows service; i'd be surprised if the chrome driver didn't suffer from some of the same challenges.
[2014-02-18 07:14:38] jimevans: that's part of the problem though
[2014-02-18 07:14:57] jimevans: with "services" it'll "mostly work" then break when you don't expect it.
[2014-02-18 07:15:12] jimevans: bottom line is that you've got a number of moving parts, and you don't know where it's broken.
[2014-02-18 07:15:31] jimevans: you don't know if it's chromedriver.exe, the .net bindings, or the chrome browser that's at fault.
[2014-02-18 07:15:34] fuppinshire1: I think I need to get the error reporting working the way it's supposed to so I can have an actual exception to work with
[2014-02-18 07:15:58] jimevans: if you think that will help, sure.
[2014-02-18 07:16:01] fuppinshire1: but whether or not its fixable I don't really care, I can always just say "write your unit tests in phantomjs or I will beat you with a stick"
[2014-02-18 07:16:15] fuppinshire1: more just curious as to why its happening
[2014-02-18 07:16:40] fuppinshire1: also it only happens running the unit tests in the prod environment, the beta environment always works
[2014-02-18 07:16:53] jimevans: well, i've given you a pretty detailed view of what the .net bindings are doing.
[2014-02-18 07:17:06] fuppinshire1: yeah that is good stuff, I will think on it

[2014-02-18 07:17:40] fuppinshire1: side question, what's the deal with Selenium saying an element is "not visible" when I don't set the window size but visible when I do set it (PhantomJS)
[2014-02-18 07:17:44] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 07:18:02] fuppinshire1: I get that phantomjs starts up with a pretty small default size it's just strange that it would matter
[2014-02-18 07:18:04] jimevans: depends on the application, and the html generated.
[2014-02-18 07:18:26] fuppinshire1: i've only ever seen it once
[2014-02-18 07:18:37] jimevans: in particular, consider an app that uses a <div> element with overflow turned off so that scroll bars aren't displayed by the browser.
[2014-02-18 07:18:38] andendau, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 07:18:57] jimevans: now further consider that the element exists outside the current viewport for whatever reason.
[2014-02-18 07:19:23] jimevans: there's no way, using standard UI movements, for the user to bring that element into the viewport
[2014-02-18 07:19:27] jimevans: thus, it's invisible.
[2014-02-18 07:19:36] fuppinshire1: mmmm for some reason I was thinking it only cared about the visible attribute
[2014-02-18 07:19:42] fuppinshire1: yeah that makes sense
[2014-02-18 07:19:52] jimevans: nope. it cares about whether the user can scroll to make it visible.
[2014-02-18 07:20:13] jimevans: in the case i just outlined, the user can't, so there's no way to bring it to be interacted.

[2014-02-18 11:29:17] seleniumCsharpBi: <jimevans> good to know its not global issue
[2014-02-18 11:31:10] seleniumCsharpBi: @,jimevans , Wwas running tests on FF on the same box a month ago

[2014-02-18 11:32:32] dimacus: seleniumCsharpBi: i think i've seen the port 7055 issue before
[2014-02-18 11:32:45] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 11:33:18] dimacus: it's when webdriver tries to talk to firefox but firefox does not respond… most often would happen to me when the version of selenium jar or the bindings was too old for version of firefox you have on your system
[2014-02-18 11:34:06] jimevans: waitaminute. i just had a thought.
[2014-02-18 11:34:13] jimevans: you're using coded ui tests, right?
[2014-02-18 11:34:37] jimevans: which means you're using the microsoft wrapper for the .net bindings, right? (the "selenium cross-browser tools")
[2014-02-18 11:36:45] dimacus: jimevans: what you thinking is the issue?
[2014-02-18 11:37:10] dimacus: the wrapper of the wrapper he is using is outdated?
[2014-02-18 11:37:31] jimevans: those tools don't get updated as often as the .net bindings themselves, and just downloading the latest .net bindings isn't sufficient to update the bindings.
[2014-02-18 11:37:48] jimevans: (because they're using strong-named assemblies)
[2014-02-18 11:38:06] dimacus: yeah… i've had a similar issue once before with Jenkins Grid plugin… swapping out stand alone jar seems to have fixed it though
[2014-02-18 11:38:11] barancev: seleniumCsharpBi: start Firefox with webdriver, put scenario on the pause (e.g. indebugger) and watch netstat results, you should see a firefox process listening to port 7055: http://screencast.com/t/gj0kHVPT662 and http://screencast.com/t/MI5n191D
[2014-02-18 11:40:08] dimacus: seleniumCsharpBi: "netstat -a 7055" i believe to filter out all the other ports
[2014-02-18 11:40:22] seleniumCsharpBi: ok
[2014-02-18 11:41:30] barancev: dimacus: no you can't restrict it to a port
[2014-02-18 11:42:10] dimacus: errr you are right, i'm too used to lsof
[2014-02-18 11:43:06] barancev: but you can grep (on linux) or find (on windows)
[2014-02-18 11:43:10] barancev: netstat -ao | find /i "7055"
[2014-02-18 11:43:40] dimacus: yeah that's what i was going for, found that example in my code as you posted that
[2014-02-18 11:43:56] dimacus: on linux is stupid simple "lsof -i :7055"
[2014-02-18 11:47:27] barancev: linux is easy!
[2014-02-18 11:47:58] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 11:48:46] dimacus: barancev: yeah agreed… i'm a somewhat skilled windows & IIS admin, especially with CLI and scripts… it's not on my resume, bc i never want to be hired to do that as the main job ever :)
[2014-02-18 11:49:49] barancev: there is powershell, though
[2014-02-18 11:49:58] barancev: that is really powerfull
[2014-02-18 11:50:29] barancev: you can even run selenium from the command line :)
[2014-02-18 11:50:43] dimacus: yeah that's what i meant, love powershell, but it's like they took 80% of bash and called it complete
[2014-02-18 11:50:45] barancev: like in python or ruby interactive console
[2014-02-18 11:51:06] dimacus: yeah, i live in IRB for debuging… it's imposible to find flakes without it
[2014-02-18 11:51:12] p_l: dimacus: actually they did 320% of bash ;)
[2014-02-18 11:51:16] barancev: powershell has more power than bash
[2014-02-18 11:51:35] p_l: to be specific, PowerShell has more in common with LispM listener than bash
[2014-02-18 11:51:42] dimacus: yes/no… it does have nice hook into registry, love being able to navigate registry as a dir structure
[2014-02-18 11:51:42] p_l: or with Pry
[2014-02-18 11:52:22] p_l: another relation closer to PowerShell than Bash is SCSH

[2014-02-18 11:52:24] dimacus: hate that they took commands like "tee" but did not deem it important enough to accept the -a argument… so you have to write your own wrapper
[2014-02-18 11:52:57] p_l: dimacus: that's because iirc "tee" is just a convenience alias/wrapper around actual commandlet
[2014-02-18 11:53:21] dimacus: touche
[2014-02-18 11:54:13] *p_l did initial setup of a Windows 2k12r2 domain controller with just powershell. Was interesting trip.'
[2014-02-18 11:54:39] dimacus: at one point, we had a set of powershell scripts running that would spin up a VMWare enterprice solution assign IPs, join domain, create local admins, install IIS, java, configure it all and have a production ready box in roughly 5 mins
[2014-02-18 11:54:54] dimacus: updating prod cluster was never that much fun again, in windows
[2014-02-18 11:54:56] seleniumCsharpBi:   <barancev>  breakpoint after launching firefox driver , browser launches   , but   netstat -ao | find /i "7055" returns nothing
[2014-02-18 11:54:56] jleyba, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-02-18 11:55:50] dimacus: seleniumCsharpBi: did you put the break point before or after you requested new session? that is, can your break point be after the initial timeout happened, and test says it's no longer can reach firefox
[2014-02-18 11:56:28] seleniumCsharpBi: breakpoint after " IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();"
[2014-02-18 11:56:40] dimacus: hmmm maybe you should put it before
[2014-02-18 11:57:17] dimacus: then open up the terminal, and run the netstat command, then click on next step so the firefox window is launched as you keep hitting the netstat at the same time
[2014-02-18 11:57:27] jimevans: dimacus: it's not easy to break between launch of firefox and attempt to create the new session.
[2014-02-18 11:57:29] seleniumCsharpBi: ok
[2014-02-18 11:57:40] p_l: dimacus: 2k12r2 starts to include support to use PowerShell as something like Chef/Puppet etc.
[2014-02-18 11:57:43] jimevans: (in .net)
[2014-02-18 11:57:56] dimacus: jimevans: sad :(
[2014-02-18 11:58:05] dimacus: can you do a "watch" command in powershell?
[2014-02-18 11:58:40] jimevans: dimacus: well you'll run into the same thing with java. that's what jlebya's hobby horse about "too much in constructors" was all about.
[2014-02-18 11:58:41] dimacus: something similar to how this guy implemented the "Watch-Command" http://nightroman.wordpress.com/2006/09/26/watch-command-ps1-watch-commands-output-repeatedly/
[2014-02-18 11:58:45] p_l: Probably (and if not, you can code a cmdlet that will allow it)
[2014-02-18 11:59:33] jimevans: (but the proposed solution doesn't solve that problem either, i hasten to add)
[2014-02-18 11:59:53] seleniumCsharpBi: <jimevans> which means you're using the microsoft wrapper for the .net bindings, right? (the "selenium cross-browser tools") ? No we are not using the Cross browser tool

[2014-02-18 13:10:19] AutomatedTester: definitely cant do that in the python bindings

[2014-02-18 13:16:56] smccarthy: using the java bindings
[2014-02-18 13:17:04] jimevans: cast to HasCapabilities?
[2014-02-18 13:17:19] smccarthy: jimevans: thanks, i'll try that
[2014-02-18 13:18:05] AutomatedTester: samtc: why dont you want to use tmp?
[2014-02-18 13:21:06] samtc: AutomatedTester: why I should?
[2014-02-18 13:21:42] samtc: I have SSD storage and want to use that to store my FF profiles
[2014-02-18 13:21:57] AutomatedTester: right, and we destroy them on quit()
[2014-02-18 13:22:20] AutomatedTester: so storing your FF profiles that are generated seems interesting

[2014-02-18 13:33:26] JOBGG: hey, is there any way to include the selenium webdriver into a C# winforms application that doesn't involve fidgeting with filepaths?
[2014-02-18 13:33:57] jimevans: JOBGG: how do you mean?
[2014-02-18 13:34:22] *jimevans doesn't understand what file paths have to do with the .net bindings'
[2014-02-18 13:35:09] dimacus: uploading files in forms… getting file paths to that?
[2014-02-18 13:35:14] JOBGG: there is the seperate chromedriver.exe, and the way i have it now is that the user selects the exe in order to start chromedriver.
[2014-02-18 13:35:32] jimevans: okay.
[2014-02-18 13:35:36] jimevans: still not seeing the problem.
[2014-02-18 13:35:47] doogan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-18 13:35:57] jimevans: if chromedriver.exe is located in the same directory as the .net bindings assemblies, by default, it'll just find them.
[2014-02-18 13:36:09] jimevans: s/them/it/
[2014-02-18 13:36:21] JOBGG: so i was just putting them in the wrong folder?
[2014-02-18 13:36:35] JOBGG: no wonder
[2014-02-18 13:36:36] jimevans: i don't know. can't see your code from here.
[2014-02-18 13:36:37] seleniumCsharpBi: <jimevans> you're not using the "selenium components for coded ui tests" (from http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/11cfc881-f8c9-4f96-b303-a2780156628d), but have they ever been installed? - yes remember installing them in the past , to see if they work , they did not work
[2014-02-18 13:37:15] jimevans: JOBGG: however, you can always tell your webdriver code where the executables are.
[2014-02-18 13:37:47] jimevans: and if you put them in a subdirectory of your application's directory, you can still find them without too much trouble.

[2014-02-18 13:42:17] jimevans: so you need to make sure that chromedriver.exe gets deployed to the same directory as your executable. in visual studio, this is usually bin\Debug or bin\Release, right?
[2014-02-18 13:42:20] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 13:42:47] dimacus: jimevans: what if he adds the location where the chromdriver.exe to the global path?
[2014-02-18 13:43:08] samtc, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-02-18 13:44:15] jimevans: so add chromedriver.exe to your project, right-click on it in the solution explorer, and in the properties window, change "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy Always"
[2014-02-18 13:44:33] jimevans: dimacus: that's fine if you're only interested in deploying to your local machine.
[2014-02-18 13:45:23] jimevans: the minute you want to deploy as a "real" application, that means you've got to mess with the user's path, which then implies an installer, and so on. xcopy deploy ftw.
[2014-02-18 13:46:11] dimacus: roger
[2014-02-18 13:46:42] dimacus: jimevans: unless you wanna be clever about it, and have the exe auto downloaded at run time, and self update ;)
[2014-02-18 13:47:06] JOBGG: I think I've given up on clever, i just want it to work properly.
[2014-02-18 13:47:20] jimevans: dimacus: okay, but then you still have to worry about being on the path. which is a pita.
[2014-02-18 13:48:07] jimevans: because the only directories you can *absolutely* *positively* count on as being on the path are "special" and have execution and write restrictions (i'm looking at you, system32 directory)

[2014-02-18 14:03:41] p_l: (because every time they lock something down, people scream that they broke their applications)
[2014-02-18 14:03:44] nirvdrum: The built-in Windows ACL system is substantially better.
[2014-02-18 14:04:05] p_l: nirvdrum: windows is more akin to having a linux system where users apps want write access to /root and /usr/lib
[2014-02-18 14:04:07] nirvdrum: ( and yes I'm aware that there are ACL systems for Linux, but no one uses them).
[2014-02-18 14:04:33] p_l: nirvdrum: because POSIX ACLs suck so much that black holes hide in shame (as you can guess, yes, I did work with that crap)
[2014-02-18 14:04:47] nirvdrum: p_l: In my experience that hasn't been true since Windows XP.
[2014-02-18 14:05:11] p_l: nirvdrum: applications wanting to write to system dirs? Well, NT6 added redirections and virtual mounts to mitigate that
[2014-02-18 14:05:18] nirvdrum: p_l: it's just rather silly that in order to create the process the ability to append to a file you also have to grant the process the ability to delete the file.

[2014-02-18 18:40:10] JohnnySparkles: Hi everyone
[2014-02-18 18:40:45] JohnnySparkles: I'm having an issue with finding an element loaded on a page with js.
[2014-02-18 18:41:09] JohnnySparkles: I've seen this is a common problem and have tried using waits etc... but have not made any progress.
[2014-02-18 18:41:51] JohnnySparkles: The site is: http://nrlfantasyfinals.dailytelegraph.com.au/
[2014-02-18 18:43:08] JohnnySparkles: And the element I'm attempting to locate is loaded by clicking the login in the top left. I'm trying to find the cam_username element.
[2014-02-18 18:43:32] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 18:43:39] JohnnySparkles: There appears to be two of them on the page. Does anyone have any ideas on how to debug this issue?

[2014-02-18 20:09:28] JOBGG: how are you selecting it?
[2014-02-18 20:10:05] JohnnySparkles: I'm using python bindings. browser.find_element_by_id('cam_username')
[2014-02-18 20:10:56] mdas, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-18 20:11:05] JohnnySparkles: I've also tried xpath and css selection to no avail. I do notice that there are multiple nested <body> tags in the html. Could this be causing an issue?
[2014-02-18 20:11:47] JohnnySparkles: I've tried to debug down into webdriver itself to see exactly what html it is currently looking at however I could not find that.
[2014-02-18 20:12:07] JohnnySparkles: That appeared to be internal to the browser itself.
