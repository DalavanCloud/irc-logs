[2014-02-03 09:28:50] CyberKAS: But I think my problem is that this checkbox is disabled. I think.
[2014-02-03 09:29:12] *Dave_B_ looks up one line'
[2014-02-03 09:29:25] Dude-X: does isSelected make an isEnabled check?
[2014-02-03 09:29:35] CyberKAS: The checked attribute returns true
[2014-02-03 09:29:43] CyberKAS: I was checking for "checked"
[2014-02-03 09:29:49] jimevans: CyberKAS: but that's what i'm saying. there are tests that explicitly test that you can check the selected property of a disabled checkbox.
[2014-02-03 09:29:50] CyberKAS: looks like it's working
[2014-02-03 09:29:52] CyberKAS: sorry guys!
[2014-02-03 09:30:10] jimevans: yep. "boolean" attributes are treated as special by getattribute.
[2014-02-03 09:30:36] jimevans: because html < 5 and html5 act differently with them.
[2014-02-03 09:30:42] CyberKAS: I got confused because in the markup it set the checked attribute to "checked"

[2014-02-03 09:31:42] jimevans: the very presence of the attribute is interpreted by the browser as set to "true". while the correct markup in html5 is attributename="attributename", browsers still have to render the legacy or incorrect markup.
[2014-02-03 09:32:59] jimevans: now that there are more people online, i'll re-ask my question from first thing this morning: who else got spammed about creating a video training course for selenium? (i'm trying to figure out whether to be insulted or flattered, and how much of either)
[2014-02-03 09:33:58] gittish, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-03 09:34:00] lukeis: i did not get spammed… or my filtering is that good or my 'first wake up in the morning and delete email brain' already forgot what i deleted ;)
[2014-02-03 09:36:05] jimevans: i'm using "spammed" somewhat loosely here. "unsolicited email" is more like. it's from a legit publishing company, offering actual royalties and advances, and what not, but i'm always skeptical when someone singles out me for something like that, so  i figure i can't be the only one.

[2014-02-03 09:40:32] lukeis: i don't think much about it… but it does mean a dependency in the Selenium lib that is more than the core language library, which is something we have avoided doing
[2014-02-03 09:40:54] lukeis: and in general I'd be −1 to it

[2014-02-03 09:47:02] Dude-X: probably for RC, to support python 5
[2014-02-03 09:47:04] Dude-X: err python 2.5
[2014-02-03 09:47:13] lukeis: actually looks like 2.5, yeah
[2014-02-03 09:47:23] lukeis: and it's in webdriver
[2014-02-03 09:47:49] Dude-X: i wonder if the std lib uses a compiled json lib
[2014-02-03 09:48:15] lukeis: basically all the versions we support use the "json" lib :)
[2014-02-03 09:48:34] lukeis: the code in webdriver/remote/utils.py  could remove the simplejson references
