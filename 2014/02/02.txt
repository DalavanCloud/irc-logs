[2014-02-02 11:43:31] Dude-X: HowardwLo: you'd have to write a for loop
[2014-02-02 11:43:38] Dude-X: based on that list of elements you have
[2014-02-02 11:43:57] Dude-X: question is, do you want ALL elements to be visible?
[2014-02-02 11:44:10] HowardwLo: ah, no
[2014-02-02 11:44:23] HowardwLo: its either element1 or element2 will be visible
[2014-02-02 11:44:40] HowardwLo: and depending on what is displayed/visible, i want selenium to do different things
[2014-02-02 11:44:55] HowardwLo: if element1: do A, else: do B, etc..
[2014-02-02 11:45:19] HowardwLo: the method provided by lukeis only goes as far as selecting either element, i can't split the logic
[2014-02-02 11:45:37] HowardwLo: unlessâ€¦â€¦i do if on the element
[2014-02-02 11:46:16] Dude-X: hmm lukeis gave you this snippet: (lambda d: d.find_elements_by_id("element1").extend(d.find_elements_by_id("element2"))[0]
[2014-02-02 11:46:32] Dude-X: that is line 6

[2014-02-02 11:49:09] HowardwLo: right, i think thats the easiest way
[2014-02-02 11:49:29] HowardwLo: they won't both be id's though XD wish it was that easy
[2014-02-02 11:49:58] Dude-X: wow line 6 is pretty brilliant; i wouldn't have thought of doing something like that.
[2014-02-02 11:50:05] Dude-X: but regardless
[2014-02-02 11:50:36] Dude-X: question: does element1 AND element2 exist at the same time?
[2014-02-02 11:50:42] barancev|2: compound selectors are better :)
[2014-02-02 11:50:57] Dude-X: do we support compound css selectors?
[2014-02-02 11:50:58] barancev|2: let the browser do the job

[2014-02-02 13:23:36] Dude-X: normally you know exactly what element you want
[2014-02-02 13:23:58] Dude-X: you can either search for the first element for a short period like 3 seconds
[2014-02-02 13:26:03] Dude-X: and then separately find the second alternate element
[2014-02-02 13:26:14] Dude-X: but the real problem isn't that line;
[2014-02-02 13:26:50] Dude-X: it's mostly likely you need to wait a bit before you find the those two elements

[2014-02-02 13:29:29] HowardwLo: right, i do notice the page redirects (or looks like it)
[2014-02-02 13:30:13] HowardwLo: is there a difference between the driver.find_element_by_xpath vs elem = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//div[@class="flash-content"]')))
[2014-02-02 13:30:32] HowardwLo: because the By.XPATH works, whereas the driver.find method does not and timesout

[2014-02-02 13:42:46] Dude-X: HowardwLo: if a simple wait method fails, you need to wait on a intermediate element
[2014-02-02 13:44:08] HowardwLo: Dude-X: is there a go-to intermediate element?
[2014-02-02 13:44:15] HowardwLo: probably not...huh
[2014-02-02 13:44:16] Dude-X: no you have to figure it out
[2014-02-02 13:44:57] Dude-X: i use tools like firebug, fire path to study what happens to the DOM
[2014-02-02 13:45:03] Dude-X: as the page loads
[2014-02-02 13:46:04] HowardwLo: and tips on handling two different pages?
[2014-02-02 13:46:50] Dude-X: ever read about the page object model
[2014-02-02 13:48:09] Dude-X: in python, you would create a class that represents one view of a web page. It would have all the locators needed, and methods that would encapsulate the actions you take on that element
