[2014-02-04 03:24:21] Malinus: Hello. I'm currently trying to use seleniums webdrive to take "screenshot" of the *full* rendered webpage. Currently when I use it with internet explorer I actually get the full page, but when I use it with chrome I'm getting a cropped page corresponding in size to the viewpoint of the browser. Is there any way to "fix" that?
[2014-02-04 03:24:39] Malinus: I'm using the python version of selenium, if that matters.
[2014-02-04 03:25:04] bimmelino: no malinus, you cant fix this
[2014-02-04 03:25:25] Malinus: bimmelino, I see. What would you suggest then?
[2014-02-04 03:26:35] bimmelino: i'm using firefox in general :P
[2014-02-04 03:27:42] Malinus: bimmelino, so am I. But I'm trying to automate taking screenshots of a website, for internet explorer and chrome. But i guess I'll have to see if there is something similar to selenium that could do it for chrome?

[2014-02-04 03:29:48] Malinus: bimmelino, selenium wouldn't happen to have control over scrolling with chrome, so I could simply scroll, and take screenshots, and the put them together?

[2014-02-04 08:36:22] winuser2003: well, what I am trying to figure out is whats the purpose of this class file to define string values when in the testclass file it does that already
[2014-02-04 08:37:13] jimevans: there may not be one. unless you want to use the same string values in multiple test classes.

[2014-02-04 09:05:41] jcromartie: so in a real test that would fail and the next run would get a new driver
[2014-02-04 09:05:43] ato: Are you dealing with an invalid element reference?
[2014-02-04 09:06:00] ato: Looks like it's trying to call the method click on a null pointer.

[2014-02-04 09:06:41] jcromartie: I did try to click before
[2014-02-04 09:06:54] jcromartie: but if those errors put the driver into a failed state and it needs to be thrown away, that's important to know

[2014-02-04 09:07:36] ato: I may have expressed myself inarticulately.
[2014-02-04 09:07:54] ato: What I meant is that exceptions usually are fatal in most programming languages.
[2014-02-04 09:08:10] ato: Certain few errors WebDriver raises are fatal.  Most aren't.
[2014-02-04 09:08:53] Dave_B_: certainly lots of errors can be dealt with just fine if you know they may come up with what you're doing, though I'm suspecting a mistake causing the constant exception throwing?
[2014-02-04 09:08:58] jcromartie: so, can I handle an exception from the WebDriver and do anything else?
