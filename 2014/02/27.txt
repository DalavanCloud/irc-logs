[2014-02-27 03:47:54] ttyp0: kumud, use javascript to check the CHR value of the first character on each row and make sure that the value is never smaller than the previous one
[2014-02-27 03:48:14] ttyp0: well, of course you will need to take uppercase vs. lowercase into consideration
[2014-02-27 03:48:29] ttyp0: and, potentially, unicode (I don't know your application)
[2014-02-27 03:49:08] ttyp0: well, a simple thing (excluding unicode) would be to turn all characters to upper-/lowercase before the value checking
[2014-02-27 03:50:33] ttyp0: something like this might help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/463786/what-is-an-easy-way-to-call-asc-and-chr-in-javascript-for-unicode-values

[2014-02-27 04:39:01] ttyp0: hey guys, any idea why a value entered into a search field from Selenium IDE does not trigger an onChange javascript event
[2014-02-27 04:39:21] ttyp0: we have a form field that waits for text input and then 1 second after last character typed in, it performs a search
[2014-02-27 04:39:38] ttyp0: but entering a value through the script does not trigger the search
[2014-02-27 04:40:04] ttyp0: the exact command I'm using is "type xpath=//div[@id="searchTextDiv"]/input RFQ 2702"
[2014-02-27 04:40:31] ttyp0: the string "RFQ 2702" is entered in the field ok
[2014-02-27 04:42:24] ttyp0: hmmh, another related weirdness, I'm storing an ID on the previous page so I can make sure the right page is opened up after the search and that the details match
[2014-02-27 04:42:51] ttyp0: but "store css=tr.evenRow > td" quote_detail_id" is storing that locator instead of the value in that table cell
[2014-02-27 04:43:19] ttyp0: so I'm getting: [error] Actual value 'Quotation 1926413' did not match 'Quotation css=tr.evenRow > td'
[2014-02-27 04:45:45] ttyp0: ah. stupid me. storeText, not store
[2014-02-27 04:46:04] sysko, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-02-27 05:22:50] ttyp0: i.e. I define a Base URL when initially creating and saving a script
[2014-02-27 05:23:16] ttyp0: when I come back to the script later, change Base URL and save the script, the script changes are saved, but Base URL change is not
[2014-02-27 05:23:26] ttyp0: so the next time I load up that script it gives me the original Base URL

[2014-02-27 08:41:56] Museless1reator: working on installing selenium on ubuntu to run my custom scripts against an askbot server
[2014-02-27 08:42:10] Museless1reator: ...what do I need to download to run these scripts from command-line?

[2014-02-27 08:44:44] Museless1reator: python
[2014-02-27 08:44:55] jarib: basically you just need a working browser + the selenium bindings for your language

[2014-02-27 11:13:24] dude-x: IWebElement checkbox = (usual code for find element); checbox.EnhanceTypeAs<CheckBox>
[2014-02-27 11:13:34] dude-x: err it was EnhanceAs
[2014-02-27 11:13:42] dude-x: is EnhanceAs a .NEt thing?
[2014-02-27 11:14:22] jimevans: sounds like they're combining and extension method with generics to add some element-specific wrappers around the generic IWebElement.
[2014-02-27 11:15:24] mac___: logged in a the service account and ran the job again from build machine. this is the output I get from TC http://pastebin.com/dhpTTf2b line 49 is where it blows up
[2014-02-27 11:16:16] dude-x: jimevans: what is the mechanism to extend WebElement, is that something that they wrote themselves? or is that a C# construct
[2014-02-27 11:17:02] ArSn, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-02-27 11:17:36] jimevans: the construct to extend any class (called extension methods) is built into the .net framework since .NET 3.0. see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
[2014-02-27 11:18:11] jimevans: essentially it allows you to add methods to any existing type without having to create a subclass or altering the source code and recompiling.

[2014-02-27 11:20:09] mac___: jimevans I am assuming I don't see the process because TC is running under windows service?
[2014-02-27 11:21:14] jimevans: that's probably correct. and, btw, it's going to cause you trouble if you ever decide to try to test against IE.
[2014-02-27 11:21:24] jimevans: (the IE driver isn't supported running under a Windows Service)
[2014-02-27 11:21:47] trycatch: I'm having trouble with webdriverjs promises - does it have the equivalent of `finally` - run something on success and fail both?
[2014-02-27 11:21:52] lukeis: trycatch: sadly the question will need to specify *which* webdriver in js ;)  (but no, i don't use either)

[2014-02-27 11:22:31] jimevans: but honestly, i've got a ton of stuff i need to try to get done, and i'm hitting a brick wall, so i'll need to be less responsive for awhile.
[2014-02-27 11:22:32] mac___: hmmm this is my test that I am running. most people are saying the timeouts is the key? http://pastebin.com/634Kj9an I appreciate your assistance
[2014-02-27 11:22:38] trycatch: which? the default one with all the promises :)
[2014-02-27 11:22:59] lukeis: imagine i don't know JS… what promises have they made? ;)
[2014-02-27 11:23:19] trycatch: lol, that would be wayyy to long of an explanation :)
[2014-02-27 11:23:47] lukeis: i'm guessing you are referring to this one? https://www.npmjs.org/package/selenium-webdriver
[2014-02-27 11:24:11] lukeis: because this one https://www.npmjs.org/package/webdriverjs  is not run by the selenium project
[2014-02-27 11:24:27] ato: AutomatedTester, wilhelm, lukeis, jimevans: We're planning on having lunch at around 1 pm.  You guys up for that?
[2014-02-27 11:24:33] trycatch: yes, I followed the links and landed here - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs
[2014-02-27 11:24:35] lukeis: trycatch: and webdriverjs now refers to TWO implementations :(
[2014-02-27 11:24:43] trycatch: which is the page with the docs I've been following
[2014-02-27 11:24:49] lukeis: good good :)
[2014-02-27 11:24:51] jimevans: mac___: but the problem is that the element isn't being found on the page. the most common case for that is that it's not on the page when the driver looks for it, and you need to wait for it to appear. now, using the ImplicitlyWait timeout should give you 30 seconds (as it's built in your code) to find the element. if the element isn't on the page within that time, you'll get a nosuchelementexception.
[2014-02-27 11:25:02] lukeis: ato: I'm ok with that
[2014-02-27 11:25:20] lukeis: ato: jimevans says +1
[2014-02-27 11:25:47] lukeis: (he just stepped away from keyboard)
[2014-02-27 11:26:39] mac___: ok thanks for the tips jimevans. I will try and extend the waittime. I wanted confirmation that I wasn't doing something stupidly obvious
[2014-02-27 11:26:54] mac___: like having the waittime in the setup vs the actual test
[2014-02-27 11:27:01] lukeis: jleyba: there was a question by trycatch above "- does it have the equivalent of `finally` - run something on success and fail both?"

[2014-02-27 11:29:13] trycatch: lol, I've been working with that library for a couple of months and never seen that page

[2014-02-27 11:31:42] trycatch: jleyba: I just realized that it's not always a webdriver promise, but sometimes it's a promise from a different promise library - I have to use both finally and thenFinally, oh this is going to make for some ugly code

[2014-02-27 12:58:56] ato: The Java implementation is just a small shim that connects you to a HTTP server.

[2014-02-27 13:04:10] ato: In your case you don't really need to replicate the ChromeDriverService because you don't have a local HTTP server you need to start on the host machine.
[2014-02-27 13:05:29] ato: In Java, the Chrome implementation starts an HTTP server in a separate executable (written in C) that again connects to the Chrome browser's remote debugging protocol.

[2014-02-27 14:47:21] simonstewart: Roughly

[2014-02-27 14:57:13] lukeis: when i'm feeling immortal, i may do that
[2014-02-27 14:57:21] simonstewart: Or assign ownership of the tests to whoever it is that complains loudest about them being removed.
[2014-02-27 14:57:55] lukeis: i doubt they'd notice if i just did it… but they would notice when that one customer screams about their feature being broken

[2014-02-27 15:00:45] ttyp0: (yes, that's hinting towards the "anyone can test" thingy that goes on around on a regular basis)
[2014-02-27 15:00:56] ttyp0: sure, anyone CAN test it's just that if you care about the results, they probably shouldn't
[2014-02-27 15:01:14] ttyp0: at least not without some kind of more experienced guidance
[2014-02-27 15:01:36] ttyp0: not implying a developer couldn't be a good tester as well but it is less common
[2014-02-27 15:01:45] ttyp0: in my experience anyway
[2014-02-27 15:02:28] ttyp0: I don't remember where I read it so don't quote me on this but a harsh statistical fact is that developers find only about 30% of their own bugs
