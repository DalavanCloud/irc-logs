[2014-02-10 11:33:26] jimevans: i sincerely doubt the developer tools do it this way.

[2014-02-10 11:33:53] jimevans: you'd need to add it to the source of the page being browsed.

[2014-02-10 11:52:51] Dude-X: although the current way is not bad, in that it is explicit;
[2014-02-10 11:53:27] Dude-X: meh i don't feel that strongly about it; but the switch to parent frame is very useful
[2014-02-10 11:55:24] jimevans: Dude-X: i don't see how that's simpler. consider the case where you're working with multiple windows simultaneously (not sequentially). in other words, work in window 1; switch to window 2 and do work; switch back to window 1 and do work; then back to window 2 again and do work.
[2014-02-10 11:56:07] jimevans: there's no way, from switchTo.window() to know which one you mean.
[2014-02-10 11:56:46] jimevans: theoretically, you could smooth out the case in locating a newly opened window, and in fact, the .NET bindings have a support class that does exactly that.
[2014-02-10 11:56:48] Dude-X: we can have switchTo.otherWindow() that can automatically check the length of window handles, check the current window, and then switch to the other
[2014-02-10 11:57:05] Dude-X: then wait for the current window to reflect the new handle
[2014-02-10 11:57:29] Dude-X: but are there cases where people open a 3rd window or more?
[2014-02-10 11:57:41] jimevans: oh, dear lord, yes.
[2014-02-10 11:57:52] jimevans: they're horrific, but they exist.

[2014-02-10 11:59:37] Dude-X: maybe a switchTo.newlyOpenedwindow()
[2014-02-10 12:00:00] Dude-X: but i guess the basic API works enough that people can write their own wrpapers
[2014-02-10 12:00:12] jimevans: and now, you've just introduced an api contract that is designed to fail
[2014-02-10 12:00:22] Dude-X: designed to fail?

[2014-02-10 12:01:04] barancev|2: what if 2 windows opened at the same time?
[2014-02-10 12:01:07] jimevans: yep. what if there's not a "newly opened window" to work with? window opening isn't guaranteed to be synchronous; what then?
[2014-02-10 12:01:11] Dude-X: 2 windows

[2014-02-10 14:17:30] lukeis: more baffling things with our healthcare: hospitals 'bill' at one rate (what they'd leave you on the hook for) and insurance pays another rate and the hospitals just accept it
[2014-02-10 14:17:38] ttyp0: or maybe it's just the extreme examples that we get to read about here :)
[2014-02-10 14:18:01] Dude-X: most places outside of the US tend to have sane healthcare

[2014-02-10 14:18:10] ttyp0: like someone had a basic surgery (think appendix removal or similar) and the hospital charged like $8000 for it
[2014-02-10 14:18:27] Dude-X: i think an appendectomy here is like 20K
[2014-02-10 14:18:29] Dude-X: in NYC
[2014-02-10 14:18:40] ttyp0: and a couple nights spent in the hospital recovering and the bill was $3600
[2014-02-10 14:18:59] lukeis: my second born had a 1 week stay in the NICU, we got the initial bill because insurance initially declined it (due to paperwork error)â€¦ $80k
[2014-02-10 14:19:01] Dude-X: ttyp0: that's very expense still; but in the US those rates are double or more
[2014-02-10 14:19:06] jimevans: lukeis: that's simple negotiation. the insurance company and the hospital negotiate on what the rate each will accept, and they contract at that rate.
