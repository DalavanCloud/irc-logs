[2014-02-13 03:20:24] simonstewart: yes
[2014-02-13 03:20:29] simonstewart: I'm using it lots right now
[2014-02-13 03:20:43] simonstewart: Because I have a bunch of custom extensions that are specific to my work
[2014-02-13 03:21:07] barancev|2: server (browser) side extensions?
[2014-02-13 03:21:12] simonstewart: and client side

[2014-02-13 03:22:26] barancev|2: iiuc, Augmenter adds interfaces according to the capabilities obtained from the browser, right?
[2014-02-13 03:22:38] simonstewart: right
[2014-02-13 03:22:47] simonstewart: And does so dynamically
[2014-02-13 03:22:58] barancev|2: exactly
[2014-02-13 03:23:05] simonstewart: And I use that
[2014-02-13 03:23:14] barancev|2: but how is it related to client side extensions?
[2014-02-13 03:24:12] simonstewart: An extension to selenium is composed of the new handlers, urls, and handlers on the remote end. The local end gets a role-based interface and an implementation of that interface
[2014-02-13 03:24:28] simonstewart: "client" extension is a relatively meaningless term
[2014-02-13 03:24:45] simonstewart: Since there is no "client" defined anywhere. I'm guessing you mean "local"?
[2014-02-13 03:25:30] barancev|2: can you give an example of an extensions?
[2014-02-13 03:25:52] simonstewart: I've added the ability to collect a different kind of log to android devices
[2014-02-13 03:26:03] barancev|2: (actually I have two technical issues but want to understand use cases first)
[2014-02-13 03:26:05] simonstewart: Added the ability to punt some expected condition checks to the remote end
[2014-02-13 03:26:25] simonstewart: and I'm about to add an end point for some interactions I want to experiment with
[2014-02-13 03:26:53] barancev|2: aha, so on the client side you deal with pure RemoteWebDriver, not a subclass of it?
[2014-02-13 03:27:33] simonstewart: Right
[2014-02-13 03:31:14] barancev|2: simonstewart: I want to change a check driver.getClass() instanceof RemoteWebDriver to driver.getClass() == RemoteWebDriver.class in Augmenter to fix #6681

[2014-02-13 03:31:50] simonstewart: In the ideal world, no
[2014-02-13 03:32:10] simonstewart: But it's because the subclasses do work in their constructors
[2014-02-13 03:32:11] barancev|2: are we in the ideal world?

[2014-02-13 03:36:03] barancev|2: so I'll do the change and start waiting for a new issue to be reported by someone :)
[2014-02-13 03:36:17] simonstewart: Which change?

[2014-02-13 03:38:38] barancev|2: "unaugmentable" == "has non-empty default constructor"
[2014-02-13 03:38:51] simonstewart: Then your change is also incorrect
[2014-02-13 03:38:59] simonstewart: Since you don't know whether the subclass has a no-op constructor
[2014-02-13 03:39:31] barancev|2: I want to restrict it to RemoteWebDriver only
[2014-02-13 03:39:51] barancev|2: subclasses are not augmented, they are untouched
[2014-02-13 03:40:06] barancev|2: it is not worse that the current implementation
[2014-02-13 03:40:16] simonstewart: Right. But if they're being passed to the Augmenter, there's an assumption that they will be augmented
[2014-02-13 03:40:36] simonstewart: So letting people know their assumption is wrong is a Useful Thing To Do
[2014-02-13 03:40:44] barancev|2: most people just want to cast to TakesScreenshots
[2014-02-13 03:41:01] barancev|2: and they know that a driver should be augmented before the caast

[2014-02-13 03:41:32] simonstewart: Besides, the augmenter should have things well alone if the concrete class implemented all the appropriate interfaces

[2014-02-13 03:48:02] ato: alko: Basically you just need a checkout of the repo.  The build system is triggered through the "./go" command.
[2014-02-13 03:48:14] ato: Well, I don't agree because I find Maven absolutely terrible.

[2014-02-13 03:50:36] alko: but nothing for eclipse
[2014-02-13 03:51:10] ato: The .project is for Eclipse.

[2014-02-13 03:52:04] ato: Should just be a matter of importing the directory.

[2014-02-13 05:48:29] rorycb: simonstewart: If I was looking at writing  webdriver binding (not sure what it is actually called) that allowed users to do webdriver.BlackBerry() are there any best practices/guides/instructions for it or just have a look at the other remote driver ones and go from there?
[2014-02-13 05:49:19] rorycb: and obviously follow the Selenium contrib guide.

[2014-02-13 07:53:53] sysko1: or by using smartly selenium2 command together it's possible to recreate these missing comamnd ?
[2014-02-13 07:54:07] simonstewart: sysko1: the webdriver apis can do basically everything the rc ones could, but in a neater format
[2014-02-13 07:54:21] sysko1: ok so even if there's is less
[2014-02-13 07:54:37] sysko1: "natively" it's still possible to do as much
[2014-02-13 07:54:51] simonstewart: right
[2014-02-13 07:55:05] sysko1: as if before  we got  turnlef turnright  lookInTheRIght lookInTheleft
[2014-02-13 07:55:11] sysko1: and now   left  right  look , turn
[2014-02-13 07:55:15] simonstewart: right
[2014-02-13 07:55:32] simonstewart: As in "correct" :)
[2014-02-13 07:55:40] WhereIsMySpoon: sysko1: make a test case in the IDE and export with non backed
[2014-02-13 07:55:43] WhereIsMySpoon: then export with backed
[2014-02-13 07:55:49] WhereIsMySpoon: see how much more lovely the backed version is
[2014-02-13 07:55:51] Dave_B_: 2.38 is latest? :o thought we were on 2.39 a while ago
[2014-02-13 07:55:55] simonstewart: Builder exports 2.0 natively
[2014-02-13 07:56:03] WhereIsMySpoon: aye
[2014-02-13 07:56:06] simonstewart: Then the status on this channel needs to be updated ;)
[2014-02-13 07:56:11] sysko1: I see, cool,  is there a place where the "magic combination of "how to do with 2.0 what was possible with 1 " ?
[2014-02-13 07:56:20] simonstewart: 2.39 it is
[2014-02-13 07:56:39] sysko1: or tools to make automatic conversion ?
[2014-02-13 07:56:45] simonstewart: Other than our docs?

[2014-02-13 07:59:04] sysko1: for computer science at least,  i can tell you it sucks ball
[2014-02-13 07:59:06] simonstewart: Meeting time!
[2014-02-13 07:59:11] sysko1: 1 -  stack overflow is not indexed
[2014-02-13 07:59:20] sysko1: 2 -  same for mozilla developer network
[2014-02-13 07:59:20] WhereIsMySpoon: sysko1: :<
[2014-02-13 07:59:57] WhereIsMySpoon: im not sure why I went for 2.15.0...
[2014-02-13 08:00:09] sysko1: first 5 results are "baidu answer"  (like yahoo answer but by baidu, and 100% the sam i mean "imagine a question about computer science asked on yahoo answer)
[2014-02-13 08:00:23] sysko1: i.e  outdated,  uninformative and certainly wrong
[2014-02-13 08:01:08] sysko1: so at that moment you love  IRC of project with active people ^^
[2014-02-13 08:04:44] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: ah I found out why...the book I was reading said 2.15.0

[2014-02-13 08:41:36] rorycb: lukeis: but it would wait 0 seconds or unlimited
[2014-02-13 08:41:58] lukeis: it would attempt the expected condition passed in once, and if failed, throw a timeout exception

[2014-02-13 08:46:38] lukeis: nirvdrum: what is R?
[2014-02-13 08:46:52] dogarrhea: a financial data language
[2014-02-13 08:46:54] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: a language
[2014-02-13 08:46:59] rorycb: lukeis: Let me get the test cases from Steve and play with a bit. I literally have no context on the actual issue at the moment, just said I'd ask for him to see if it was a quick answer
[2014-02-13 08:47:05] nirvdrum: A language usually used for data analysis plotting.
[2014-02-13 08:47:16] nirvdrum: basically a stats package.

[2014-02-13 09:09:11] simonstewart: I live under a bridge, only coming out when the billy goats gruff attempt to walk across

[2014-02-13 09:09:26] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: i doubt it, london is huge
[2014-02-13 09:09:30] simonstewart: I bloody love a pub, I do
[2014-02-13 09:09:34] WhereIsMySpoon: and you'd need to define what exactly is "london"
[2014-02-13 09:09:38] WhereIsMySpoon: is it the City of London
[2014-02-13 09:09:45] WhereIsMySpoon: all of the outlying villages

[2014-02-13 09:09:50] WhereIsMySpoon: ...etc
[2014-02-13 09:10:18] WhereIsMySpoon: why is there no WebDriverBackedSelenium.findElement
[2014-02-13 09:10:31] WhereIsMySpoon: like there is WebDriver.findElement
[2014-02-13 09:10:32] lukeis: cause it's WebDriver.findElement :)
[2014-02-13 09:10:35] simonstewart: Because you can just get the underlying driver and call that
[2014-02-13 09:10:41] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-02-13 09:10:51] WhereIsMySpoon: but i thought the whole point was to use the backed one
[2014-02-13 09:10:54] lukeis: WebDriverBackedSelenium.getDriver().findElement
[2014-02-13 09:10:54] WhereIsMySpoon: for v2
[2014-02-13 09:11:06] simonstewart: The webdriver-backed selenium is a migration tool
[2014-02-13 09:11:06] lukeis: only for migrating existing RC tests
[2014-02-13 09:11:17] lukeis: write new code with WebDriver directly
[2014-02-13 09:11:19] simonstewart: 3.0 will delete the RC APIs

[2014-02-13 09:12:06] lukeis: it's a good thing languages come with standard ways to do http… why these bindings keep popping out of nowhere :)
[2014-02-13 09:13:09] simonstewart: http and json: picked for a reason
[2014-02-13 09:13:16] WhereIsMySpoon: so i really shouldnt use WebDriverBackedSelenium at all
[2014-02-13 09:13:20] WhereIsMySpoon: if im writing new tests

[2014-02-13 09:36:07] lukeis: that code was inline functionality… i hope no one actually copies / pastes that and instead creates their own utility (for lack of a better word) that handles this
[2014-02-13 09:37:28] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: sorry what do you mean?
[2014-02-13 09:37:29] lukeis: the reason webdriver doesn't provide this is because every app can act differently (what if there's two popups?)
