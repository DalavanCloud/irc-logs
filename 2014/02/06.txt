[2014-02-06 04:25:10] ttyp0: hey, probably a stupid newbie question but I have a bit of trouble getting Selenium (IDE) to find certain objects on a page. I have a bunch of objects like this one (the only difference is the unique identifier): <div class="grayButton" onclick=" selectedBasket = 'a26R00000009gfoIAA'; $('#basketName').val('testinimi'); showDialog('renameBasketDialog');">Rename</div>
[2014-02-06 04:26:19] ttyp0: now, I would like Selenium to match objects based on that unique identifier (a26R00000009gfoIAA in this case), but seems like no matter what I do, Selenium just complains "locator not found"

[2014-02-06 07:10:18] Mazer: of the archived file
[2014-02-06 07:10:21] AutomatedTester: why can't you use pip or easy_install?
[2014-02-06 07:10:39] Mazer: I didn't try that
[2014-02-06 07:10:41] Mazer: I'll go see
[2014-02-06 07:11:04] AutomatedTester: I havent really made it for a manual install
[2014-02-06 07:16:13] Mazer: Where am I supposed to write the "pip install -U selenium"?
[2014-02-06 07:16:24] Mazer: Sorry for the dumb questions, I'm quite new to this
[2014-02-06 07:16:57] AutomatedTester: at a command line
[2014-02-06 07:17:18] Mazer: in python prompt?
[2014-02-06 07:17:36] AutomatedTester: in terminal or command prompt
[2014-02-06 07:20:20] Mazer: pip is not recognized  as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file
[2014-02-06 07:22:02] ato: Presumably you don't have it on your PATH.
[2014-02-06 07:22:15] ato: If you're running stock Python, try doing `easy_install pip` first.
[2014-02-06 07:22:44] cgoldberg: ato, that's assuming you have setuptools installed ;)
[2014-02-06 07:22:56] ato: Right, doesn't that come with stock Python?
[2014-02-06 07:23:00] cgoldberg: Mazer.. what OS are you on?
[2014-02-06 07:23:03] cgoldberg: ato, nope
[2014-02-06 07:23:04] ato: (It does on every Linux I've had.)
[2014-02-06 07:23:05] Mazer: windows 8
[2014-02-06 07:23:07] Mazer: 7
[2014-02-06 07:23:27] ato: cgoldberg: ffs, someone fix Python.
[2014-02-06 07:23:33] cgoldberg: ato.. in Debian and Ubuntu for example.. you need python-setuptools package
[2014-02-06 07:23:50] cgoldberg: to get easy_install
[2014-02-06 07:24:06] ato: Right.  I guess I'm just spoilt because Linux distros usually have it installed by default.
[2014-02-06 07:24:26] Mazer: so, excatly, what am I to do?
[2014-02-06 07:24:49] ato: Mazer: Do you have python and easy_install in your PATH?
[2014-02-06 07:25:06] cgoldberg: Mazer.. you need to install pip to use pip :)   but without pip, 'python setup.py install' should work if you already have the package downloaded.  is it not?
[2014-02-06 07:26:19] Mazer: didn't work when I entered it to command prompt
[2014-02-06 07:26:33] cgoldberg: Mazer, didn't work in what way?
[2014-02-06 07:26:47] Mazer: same error as I wrote above

[2014-02-06 07:28:09] cgoldberg: Mazer, do you know what a path is.. and how to use the command line?  lets start there
[2014-02-06 07:28:34] Mazer: Not so sure
[2014-02-06 07:28:37] cgoldberg: it can't find the command you are entering... so you need to add it to your path.. or else call it with the full location
[2014-02-06 07:29:23] Mazer: Can you explain like I'm five, "path"
[2014-02-06 07:29:42] cgoldberg: Mazer, it's an environment variable that tells the shell where to look for commands
[2014-02-06 07:29:45] Dave_B_: path is where your computer looks to work out what you meant when you type a command in
[2014-02-06 07:29:55] cgoldberg: or else it can't find them

[2014-02-06 07:32:37] Dave_B_: never taken the time to work out why not
[2014-02-06 07:32:57] ato: Mazer: You can update the path by right-clicking My Computer and finding the button to change “Environmental variables”.
[2014-02-06 07:33:06] ato: Mazer: There's a list of variables, one of which is PATH.
[2014-02-06 07:33:20] Dave_B_: make sure you just add to it, don't replace what is already there
[2014-02-06 07:33:24] ato: You can also try googling it.  There are several guides out there on how to install Python and changing the path.

[2014-02-06 07:35:11] Mazer: I add it to system variables or user variables?
[2014-02-06 07:35:53] cgoldberg: wherever it is currently.. you are updating a variable, not adding a new one
[2014-02-06 07:36:18] Mazer: Wait, dave_b told the opposite
[2014-02-06 07:36:35] Dave_B_: erm, it's editing what is there
[2014-02-06 07:36:55] Dave_B_: just make sure you add more to the end, don't delete the whole long line & replace it
[2014-02-06 07:37:02] cgoldberg: Mazer, no.. he said the same.. you are updating ("adding to" as he put it)

[2014-02-06 07:53:11] Mazer: What's wrong with the former?
[2014-02-06 07:55:32] ato: It's not the way the Python toolchain is built.

[2014-02-06 08:00:31] ato: There are some tools like PyCharm that runs them inside an IDE, but essentially it's just calling out to the shell to run them.
[2014-02-06 08:00:49] smyers: And, as evidenced by the conversation here, most users of Python aren't familiar enough with that mode of operation to help you when things go wrong.

[2014-02-06 08:06:12] Mazer: I mean, when writing somekind of code in script mode, why would I execute it via command prompt instead of just pressing f5 in python
[2014-02-06 08:10:13] drharmony1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-06 08:10:15] cgoldberg: Mazer, press f5 in your IDE maybe.  "pressing f5 in python" does not mean anything
[2014-02-06 08:10:57] cgoldberg: python.exe is a program that interprets and runs scripts.. or lets you program interactively from its REPL (prompt)
[2014-02-06 08:12:16] Mazer: Ok, so why would I run the program through command prompt instead of just pressing f5 in IDE?
[2014-02-06 08:12:32] ato: So you can code a Python program in any text editor, and the toolchain is built not to favour any particular approach.
[2014-02-06 08:13:14] ato: If your IDE supports pressing F5 to run it, that's great, but it essentially just shells out to run python.exe YOURFILE.
[2014-02-06 08:13:22] cgoldberg: Mazer, in that case, f5 just tells your IDE to fire up a shell and start it for you.  go for it.. that's not what I was referring to really
[2014-02-06 08:14:05] cgoldberg: Mazer, the point is.. you can do it the right way, or you can be forever be mystified and clicking things
[2014-02-06 08:14:24] ato: My editor does something similar, only bound to C-c C-c.  But the point is that the de-facto package manager (pip) only works from shell.
[2014-02-06 08:14:34] Mazer: This is quite confusing

[2014-02-06 08:18:55] nullx: Is there any way to make sure it loads?
[2014-02-06 08:18:56] nullx: heh
[2014-02-06 08:20:53] Dave_B_: Mazer: Don't worry, all of us had to learn and it can be a bit confusing at first but it will get better if you try :)
[2014-02-06 08:21:20] Mazer: Where should I start?
[2014-02-06 08:21:49] Dave_B_: you can still write your python in your IDE if you like, IDEs are nice, but try to make sure it'll run from the command prompt too
[2014-02-06 08:22:01] Dave_B_: run it from command prompt early
[2014-02-06 08:22:07] Dave_B_: don't wait to have finished it
[2014-02-06 08:22:43] Dave_B_: it'll help make sure your program works properly, as the IDE may be changing things you didn't know about (like working directory or environemnt variables or something) and so masking a problem
[2014-02-06 08:23:03] Dave_B_: and through doing that you'll get a better understanding of how python programs/your program/computers work
[2014-02-06 08:23:47] Mazer: So just, whatever I'm coding, I should test it as I code, both in my IDE and through command prompt?
[2014-02-06 08:23:58] tony1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-06 08:23:59] Dave_B_: yep. presumably the programs you're writing will eventually need run elsewhere, and when that happens they'll need to work from command prompt
[2014-02-06 08:24:30] Mazer: Run elsewhere, meaning what?
[2014-02-06 08:24:58] Dave_B_: like if it's a test it might want to be run on a buuild server, if it's a utility it might want to be run on someone else's computer
[2014-02-06 08:25:40] Dave_B_: if it runs at your command prompt you're a big step towards being able to run it anywhere, while inside the IDE you'll not know if it works elsewhere or not
[2014-02-06 08:25:47] Dave_B_: (it might, but...)
[2014-02-06 08:26:33] Dave_B_: nullx: I've never seen that :( have you tried to work out whats different between the machines? and/or how is your code trying to wait at the moment?
[2014-02-06 08:26:58] Mazer: Ok, I still didn't catch that, why not double click instead of writing up the path in the command prompt

[2014-02-06 10:07:47] ato: Normally WebDriver will block until the page is fully loaded, however.

[2014-02-06 10:08:49] ato: Depends what your document is doing.

[2014-02-06 10:37:02] dogarrhea: how do you scroll a div in selenium?
[2014-02-06 10:37:21] dogarrhea: a div with a vertical scrollbar.  I'm trying to click an element and it is not visible and selenium throws an error
[2014-02-06 10:39:44] jimevans: dogarrhea: javascript would be the only way to make that happen. having said that, the driver *should* automatically scroll the element into view automatically in the normal case.
[2014-02-06 10:39:49] dogarrhea: guess it's not possible
[2014-02-06 10:39:56] jimevans: there are tests in the webdriver integration tests that do exactly that.
[2014-02-06 10:39:56] dogarrhea: this automation is screwed kek
[2014-02-06 10:40:27] dogarrhea: hrm it doesn't scroll to the element
[2014-02-06 10:40:37] dogarrhea: i call click() and selenium says "element not visible"
[2014-02-06 10:41:03] jimevans: yes, i hear you, and i'm not discounting what you're seeing. i'm simply pointing out what should be happening.

[2014-02-06 10:42:13] jimevans: also, different browser driver implementations may react differently, so it'd be helpful to know which browser you're seeing that with (any particular, or all browsers)?
[2014-02-06 10:42:23] dogarrhea: when i debug, scroll the div, and continue, the error mathemagically disappears
[2014-02-06 10:42:31] dogarrhea: chrome on linux
[2014-02-06 10:42:55] jimevans: ah. the one desktop driver i don't have any insight into whatsoever.

[2014-02-06 11:09:43] jimevans: dogarrhea: again, not discounting what you observe, just mentioning what is supposed to happen. also, by the way, you should be able to use executeScript and pass in the element (found by findElement) without having to resort to finding it yourself in the javascript.

[2014-02-06 11:15:38] jimevans: sure. i just figured you already had the element reference in your java code (because you found it to click on it), so it'd be easy to use that element reference in your executeScript call.

[2014-02-06 13:14:34] jimevans: for your chrome/IE/phantomjs implementations, are you folding the "service" options into the global options class?
[2014-02-06 13:15:07] jimevans: or rather allowing the builder to set those too?
[2014-02-06 13:15:13] jimevans: (that's the right way to ask)
[2014-02-06 13:16:08] jleyba: those services have their own builders, so i was just going to have  ChromeDriver.builder().setService(...).build()
[2014-02-06 13:16:48] jimevans: that's fair.

[2014-02-06 13:33:51] lukeis: have a read  http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-and-implicit-waits
[2014-02-06 13:34:30] jimevans: the single, sole, only purpose for implicit waits is to wait for an element when findElement (or findElements) is called, waiting for the specified element to be present in the DOM.
[2014-02-06 13:34:37] jimevans: anything else requires a different construct.

[2014-02-06 13:35:17] jimevans: okay. so a so-called "explicit wait" is what you want, using the WebDriverWait object.

[2014-02-06 15:36:33] lukeis: salesforce has SOAP api's for our different versions, one version is "Enterprise" (and everything else falls under "partner") :)
[2014-02-06 15:36:56] lukeis: when marketing speak bleeds into code…. ;)
[2014-02-06 15:38:53] lukeis: and of course the model for years was, if you need another tool, don't just create a class for it, add it to the hierarchy so that all tests can access the methods right away! … good lord

[2014-02-06 16:01:56] ato: So true, all the glitches I've found so far in the WD spec has come from trying to read, simplify, and documenting API code.
[2014-02-06 16:02:06] ato: has, have?

[2014-02-06 16:22:22] AutomatedTester: its the wording
[2014-02-06 16:23:02] bbark123, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-02-06 16:23:42] AutomatedTester: It MUST have a capabilites object and that object MAY have the following keys
[2014-02-06 16:23:52] AutomatedTester: but then the keys are non-normative
[2014-02-06 16:24:07] AutomatedTester: maybe I am tired and cant grok what its trying to say
[2014-02-06 16:27:55] AutomatedTester: meh
[2014-02-06 16:29:18] ato: I find that part slightly incomprehensible also.
[2014-02-06 16:29:29] ato: Maybe because I don't fully understand what we're trying to cater for.
[2014-02-06 16:30:08] ato: We're saying that the driver need to supply capabilities as a return value on newSession, and that it should have four designated capabilities, but that they can optionally be undefined.
[2014-02-06 16:30:21] ato: (browserName, browserVersion, platformName, platformVersion).
[2014-02-06 16:32:15] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-02-06 16:33:00] AutomatedTester: we MUST return capabilities = {} but we MAY also capabilities[browserName]='<insert details>';
[2014-02-06 16:33:57] ato: Right, where details can be undefined, meaning null.
[2014-02-06 16:34:31] ato: We discussed the ambiguity of the word “should” previously.  I'd be in favour of mandating something.
[2014-02-06 16:38:00] ato: Another thing, are we treating the lack of a feature capability (cssSelectorsEnabled for example) as it being unsupported?  I'm guessing we are, but do we want to clarify that?
[2014-02-06 16:39:44] AutomatedTester: you mean if IE doesnt support X and Mozilla supports Y, do we or dont we report that difference?
[2014-02-06 16:40:50] ato: I'm thinking about this from a conformance test point of view.
[2014-02-06 16:41:25] AutomatedTester: I was just clarifying what you said, yea we need to pick sides
[2014-02-06 16:41:29] ato: It's difficult to test for “should”.  The “it'd be nice of you to do this, but you're not required to” clause is hard to test for.
[2014-02-06 16:41:56] AutomatedTester: fantasai wrote a great email about testing SHOULD
[2014-02-06 16:42:16] AutomatedTester: the conformance test is done as a MUST
[2014-02-06 16:42:26] AutomatedTester: and then implementors can knowingly ignore that
[2014-02-06 16:43:15] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 741
[2014-02-06 16:43:18] ato: And it's _especially_ hard to test for the should clauses if we don't specify the way a missing, currently optional, capability should when missing.
[2014-02-06 16:43:27] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-02-06 16:43:30] ato: Oh cool, you'll have to send me the link to that when you have the time (-:
[2014-02-06 16:44:26] ato: Because we can go if not takesElementScreenshot, ignore this test class.

[2014-02-06 16:45:13] ato: A caps.get("takesElementScreenshot", False) kind of thing is fine, ofc.  But it seems, uh, frivolous, of the test suite to have to make that assumption.
[2014-02-06 16:45:40] ato: Or maybe I've had a glass of wine too much.

[2014-02-06 16:47:12] ato: Excellent, I shall grok this tomororw.
[2014-02-06 16:47:21] AutomatedTester: ato: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-test-infra/2013OctDec/0067.html
[2014-02-06 16:47:56] ato: Yes, that.
[2014-02-06 16:48:25] ato: But I think it would be easier for us because we're in the position to say up front what an implementation is supposed to support.
[2014-02-06 16:48:35] ato: And so we can include/exclude parts of the test suite.
[2014-02-06 16:48:44] ato: Provided we define the behaviour of a missing capability.
[2014-02-06 16:48:52] ato: Or maybe it's implicit.  I'm not sure.
[2014-02-06 16:49:08] AutomatedTester: i'll raise a bug about this
[2014-02-06 16:50:31] ato: Hah.  jgraham has a reply that's a lengthy version of what fantasai wrote.
