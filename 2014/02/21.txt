[2014-02-21 08:02:01] JC: Hey there, I'm working with a group of testers who are a little scared of C#.  I'm trying to find a way of allowing them to create and edit tests in the Firefox Ide... but then have something automatically compile them into N-Unit tests for use in CI
[2014-02-21 08:03:21] jimevans: JC:  you could have them export them out from IDE to C# code.
[2014-02-21 08:03:22] Bebe_sel, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-02-21 08:03:32] jimevans: but that's as far as i'll go.

[2014-02-21 08:03:56] nirvdrum_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-21 08:04:29] jimevans: but remember, the export is a one-way street. once it's exported, they'll need to actually change the code to modify the test.
[2014-02-21 08:04:55] Dave_B_: that'll probably be scarier than showing them how to build a test in c# from scratch
[2014-02-21 08:05:14] JC: yeah, it's the reliablilty of them exporting them that I'm worried about in that... and we'd need to keep a source copy of the html.
[2014-02-21 08:06:38] jimevans: automated software testing is programming. i really wish people would internalize that.
[2014-02-21 08:07:50] ato: jimevans: ++
[2014-02-21 08:09:49] jimevans: and by "people" i often mean management drones who get sucked in by the snake oil sales pitch about not needing to have people who know how to code.
[2014-02-21 08:11:03] JC: I think it's the fear of the QA types not being able to handle it here, my remit's quite limited.
[2014-02-21 08:12:28] wilhelm: Even though it's programming, translating the manual steps they'd normally do into predictable syntax for the machines to run really isn't that hard. I'd skip the IDE, but go straigt to some simple hello-world test scripts.

[2014-02-21 12:47:56] grinch_: fair enough, when i use native events (click in this case) the page load timeout doesn't work
[2014-02-21 12:48:16] jimevans: doesn't work in that it doesn't timeout?
[2014-02-21 12:48:35] jimevans: and is this linux or windows, or does it matter?
[2014-02-21 12:48:54] grinch_: in that it returns immediatelly not even checking it and the browser is basically dead since it doesn't respond to other commands until it finishes loading
[2014-02-21 12:48:59] grinch_: it's windows
[2014-02-21 12:49:58] grinch_: it seems like the timeout control mechanism that installClickListener sets up doesn't work when the function goes through the native side of the flow control structure
[2014-02-21 12:50:21] grinch_: i've just confirmed it disabling native events btw
[2014-02-21 12:50:34] grinch_: also, there's one other thing

[2014-02-21 12:51:50] grinch_: when the page load times out the driver sends an error to the client (Timed out waiting for page load or something like that) but it doesn't stop the page load which renders the browser inaccessible from there on
