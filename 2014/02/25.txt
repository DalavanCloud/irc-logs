[2014-02-25 08:08:43] dogarrhea_: to support "parallel" testing that may or may not work due to cross envirionment data bugs
[2014-02-25 08:12:22] dogarrhea_: Also, there is the problem of "some ie functionality works. most of it does not but it works on firefox"
[2014-02-25 08:12:35] dogarrhea_: How do I practically solve thsi problem without 2 versions of code
[2014-02-25 08:13:00] dogarrhea_: the selenium code written for firefox is "standard"
[2014-02-25 08:13:13] dogarrhea_: basically the thoughtworks consultant said "you're on your own for IE. I have no experience with that"
[2014-02-25 08:13:17] dogarrhea_: which is telling me all of this is BULLSHIT
[2014-02-25 08:13:51] dogarrhea_: i'm pretty much fed up with selenium. I mind as well quit and write HFT robots full time.
[2014-02-25 08:14:47] dogarrhea_: I will be damned if I have to do if(IE driver) functionality everywhere in code

[2014-02-25 08:18:43] dogarrhea_: that I have to write "oh ie is broken. let me hack around it" code is failure of selenium.

[2014-02-25 08:20:35] nirvdrum: The IE code in particular is basically written by one guy in his spare time with zero help from Microsoft.  And he's doing things that IE was simply never built to do.
[2014-02-25 08:21:05] nirvdrum: And I think he's doing a much better job than say the Chrome driver is doing.
[2014-02-25 08:21:33] dogarrhea_: a well written test plan with enough people to test the project maybe?

[2014-02-25 08:23:03] nirvdrum: And if your tests don't work in parallel, that's a problem with your development team.
[2014-02-25 08:23:14] nirvdrum: Parallel test execution has absolutely nothing to do with Selenium.
[2014-02-25 08:23:24] dogarrhea_: how so?
[2014-02-25 08:23:49] nirvdrum: All it does it your server.  If your server can't handle multiple browser sessions, I fail to see how Selenium can be faulted for that.

[2014-02-25 08:24:45] dogarrhea_: now I must maintain two versions to make things run in "parallel" or put in if(iedriver) hacks everywhere
[2014-02-25 08:24:50] dogarrhea_: how does this not affect parallel testing?
[2014-02-25 08:24:55] WhereIsMySpoon: Is there a way to ask WebDriver if an alert is appearing?
[2014-02-25 08:25:03] dogarrhea_: QED. simple logic
[2014-02-25 08:25:17] WhereIsMySpoon: It's possible that an alert pops up when I press a button but it doesnt always happen, so I need some logic
[2014-02-25 08:25:21] nirvdrum: dogarrhea_: I don't see what parallel has to do with this.  The IE problem would happen if it were the only test running too, no?

[2014-02-25 08:27:12] WhereIsMySpoon: ttyp0: ah ok..just waits then
[2014-02-25 08:27:15] dogarrhea_: ie driver chokes on bootstrap animations and user interactiosn in general, something that users use on our application all the time.
[2014-02-25 08:27:40] dogarrhea_: and i read somewehre that "oh. we have no solution for this right now" on jimevans blog
[2014-02-25 08:27:44] Mazer: That's not the problem, all I need is for it to run a certain script once an email with certain title has been recieved

[2014-02-25 08:28:03] nirvdrum: dogarrhea_: What's the issue number?
[2014-02-25 08:28:12] phasze: Mazer: sounds like your CI or other program should be doing that

[2014-02-25 08:28:45] nirvdrum: WhereIsMySpoon: Well, it doesn't break, it raises an exception.  Just handle the exception.  The browser session is still usable afterwards.
[2014-02-25 08:28:58] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: yea sorry...bit overdramatic
[2014-02-25 08:29:04] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: I meant that it throws the alert exception
[2014-02-25 08:29:06] WhereIsMySpoon: :)

[2014-02-25 08:30:11] WhereIsMySpoon: i wish i was writing in ruby
[2014-02-25 08:30:20] nirvdrum: Then I can wrap my calls like safe_webdriver { @driver.get('http://google.com/') }
[2014-02-25 08:30:27] dogarrhea_: nirvdrum: have the blog posting

[2014-02-25 08:31:09] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: that looks so much cleaner than the wait syntax in java
[2014-02-25 08:31:37] nirvdrum: WhereIsMySpoon: You could probably do something similar with an annotation processor.

[2014-02-25 08:36:03] nirvdrum: Well, unfortunately, this is just the way IE works.  An insane amount of effort has been put into working around that it seems not to be possible.  So it's incredibly disingenuous to suggest it's an open bug no one's working on.
[2014-02-25 08:36:19] dogarrhea_: and by mutiple windows, i mean the doctor clicks a link to an article.  They read the article and modify content at the same time.  they click the window that doesn't have focus anymore to modify content after reading the newly opened window.
[2014-02-25 08:36:21] nirvdrum: Second, the driver adheres to the API.  The API makes no claim about the focus of a window.
[2014-02-25 08:36:45] nirvdrum: Third, the simple solution is to just run your IE tests on a different machine.  We provide Selenium Grid to make this fairly easy.
[2014-02-25 08:37:12] ttyp0: VMs ftw
[2014-02-25 08:37:22] nirvdrum: You can switch windows through the API.

[2014-02-25 09:28:59] manoj9788: :)
[2014-02-25 09:29:00] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-25 09:29:04] nirvdrum: But popups are different obviously because they're modal.
[2014-02-25 09:29:31] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-02-25 09:29:56] WhereIsMySpoon: so i cant use explicit waits to deal with alerts at all
[2014-02-25 09:29:59] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-02-25 09:31:16] nirvdrum: I don't know what you're trying to do with waits, so I can't say.
[2014-02-25 09:32:06] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: I'm trying to click on a button. Sometimes when I click it an alert will come up, sometimes not. Therefore, when I click on it, I want to wait for a few seconds, every second of which I want to try dismissing an alert and checking for the presence of an element
[2014-02-25 09:32:26] WhereIsMySpoon: which is what waits are for when for example you're switching windows

[2014-02-25 09:33:39] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: it's the same thing with windows, wait for x seconds, every x seconds of which you try driver.switchTo().window('someWindowId') then return an element
[2014-02-25 09:33:50] WhereIsMySpoon: s/then/and/
[2014-02-25 09:36:28] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: the "sometimes an alert will come up, sometimes not" is the problem. you should always know what state to expect.
[2014-02-25 09:37:26] nirvdrum: jimevans: And now you've hit upon the difference between being browser automation framework and a web site testing tool :-)
[2014-02-25 09:38:15] jimevans: must. resist. getting. sucked. into. discussion.
[2014-02-25 09:38:15] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: but this is exactly the same thing as I can do with windows
[2014-02-25 09:38:19] WhereIsMySpoon: except with alerts
[2014-02-25 09:38:29] WhereIsMySpoon: why does it not work for alerts
[2014-02-25 09:38:33] nirvdrum: jimevans: :-D
[2014-02-25 09:39:35] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: not sure i follow. (though to be fair, i'm only half-listening, as i'm in a meeting at the mo)
[2014-02-25 09:40:03] ratem, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-25 09:41:28] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: ok basically, the story for windows is "I've clicked my 'Open Window' button but I have some javascript or some server delay and I'm not sure when the page will load. Therefore, I will use a wait which will try and switch to the window and then return a WebElement object if it exists, ignoring any NoSuchWindowException and NoSuchElementException...
[2014-02-25 09:41:58] WhereIsMySpoon: ...when the page does load, the wait is done. If the element I'm trying to look for never appears, then it will throw a timeout"
[2014-02-25 09:42:12] WhereIsMySpoon: I want to do exactly the same with alerts
[2014-02-25 09:42:34] WhereIsMySpoon: except instead of "switching to" the alert I want to close it, obviously
[2014-02-25 09:42:41] jimevans: and catching NoSuchAlertException (or whatever it's called) doesn't work?

[2014-02-25 09:46:09] xico: hi. im trying to use selenium to control an svg presentation, but hit a strange bug. basically, i simply open the page, and send the 'e' key. but i get the following message:
[2014-02-25 09:46:22] xico: selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: u'f.blur is not a function'
[2014-02-25 09:46:26] xico: with a huge stack trace
[2014-02-25 09:46:48] WhereIsMySpoon: blur is a javascript thing iirc
[2014-02-25 09:46:50] WhereIsMySpoon: or css

[2014-02-25 09:47:20] xico: WhereIsMySpoon: does it mean i need to somehow activate javascript or css?

[2014-02-25 09:47:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i doubt it
[2014-02-25 09:48:06] xico: but yeah, i guess it comes from my figure which uses a lot of blurring

[2014-02-25 09:48:51] WhereIsMySpoon: xico: I'd imagine that whatever element you're trying to put text into has some sort of handler that on text entry does something to do with blur
[2014-02-25 09:49:02] WhereIsMySpoon: and something is going wrong with that
[2014-02-25 09:49:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno just guessing
[2014-02-25 09:49:24] xico: WhereIsMySpoon: it does yes. pressing 'e' shows hidden elements containing blurring.
[2014-02-25 09:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: any ideas? Or is this just a constraint on the project in general
[2014-02-25 09:50:15] WhereIsMySpoon: xico: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12337046/selenium-driver-how-to-test-blur
[2014-02-25 09:50:24] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium doesnt do blur directly

[2014-02-25 12:19:21] plightbo_work: cased: bmp.lightbody.net or you can get the data natively from the latest versions of ghostdriver
[2014-02-25 12:19:51] plightbo_work: by calling the /session/:sessionId/log WebDriver API and putting {"type":"har"} in the request body
[2014-02-25 12:20:11] plightbo_work: that will return a HAR payload, which will have the HTTP traffic on the page loaded.
[2014-02-25 12:20:25] cased: plightbo_work: okay, whats bmp.lightbody.net?
[2014-02-25 12:20:26] plightbo_work: I recommend that approach if all you need to do is read the HTTP traffic. But if you want to modify it, you'll need bmp
[2014-02-25 12:20:38] plightbo_work: BMP is an HTTP proxy that I maintain
[2014-02-25 12:20:45] plightbo_work: that has good Selenium compatibility
[2014-02-25 12:20:58] cased: ah ok, just listening is enough
[2014-02-25 12:21:08] plightbo_work: then go with /session/:id/log

[2014-02-25 20:33:35] lukeis: ato: didn't go out tonight? :)
[2014-02-25 20:34:08] ato: lukeis: Yeah, my stomach isn't playing nice.
[2014-02-25 20:34:20] ato: Are you back already?
[2014-02-25 20:34:23] lukeis: ah :-/  sorry
[2014-02-25 20:34:27] lukeis: back?
[2014-02-25 20:34:32] ato: You didn't go?
[2014-02-25 20:34:44] lukeis: I had to go home early to take care of the kids :)
[2014-02-25 20:34:53] ato: Oh right.
[2014-02-25 20:35:12] ato: I'm staying the whole week, so I need to relax a bit before the meeting tomorrow anyways
[2014-02-25 20:35:12] lukeis: tomorrow night i'll be hanging out and The Wife too :)
[2014-02-25 20:35:29] Hello71, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2014-02-25 20:35:40] lukeis: yeah, best to take it easy and not try to keep up with Simon ;)
[2014-02-25 20:35:42] ato: Right, but maybe we could catch supper another day?
[2014-02-25 20:36:10] ato: I tried that once when he brought me to this incredibly shady French wine bar in London.  wilhelm will testify that didn't end well.
[2014-02-25 20:36:14] lukeis: supper I usually can't, cause I go home to be with the kids… but lunch :)
[2014-02-25 20:36:32] ato: Yes, let's do that… Thursday?
[2014-02-25 20:36:41] lukeis: sgtm
[2014-02-25 20:36:56] ato: \o/
[2014-02-25 20:37:14] lukeis: now… to figure out how to run these "webdriver" tests in w3c...
[2014-02-25 20:37:33] ato: Which part are you trying to solve?
[2014-02-25 20:37:53] lukeis: first things first, run the tests (i need to read the readme first…)
[2014-02-25 20:38:01] lukeis: next I'll attempt to run against selendroid
[2014-02-25 20:38:02] ato: It's pretty straight forwad.
[2014-02-25 20:38:04] Hello71, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-25 20:38:23] ato: Install the selenium Python package from PyPI, execute the test program files.
[2014-02-25 20:38:34] lukeis: looks that easy :)
[2014-02-25 20:38:40] lukeis: virtualenv required?
[2014-02-25 20:38:44] ato: Nope.
[2014-02-25 20:38:57] lukeis: okie dokie :)
[2014-02-25 20:39:01] ato: Unless you don't want selenium installed system wide.
[2014-02-25 20:39:12] *lukeis likes to install things system wide ;)'
[2014-02-25 20:39:16] ato: But as mentioned in the meeting there are really a lot of infrastructural changes we need to make.
[2014-02-25 20:39:47] ato: IMO dburns made it sound like a little change, but there really is a bunch of things to do.
[2014-02-25 20:39:48] dude-x: how was the f2f?
[2014-02-25 20:39:59] ato: dude-x: The most productive one so far, i think.
[2014-02-25 20:40:14] ato: I found it really excellent.
[2014-02-25 20:40:21] ato: We're not that far away from a LC.
[2014-02-25 20:40:29] dude-x: LC?
[2014-02-25 20:40:41] ato: Yes, sorry.  W3C vernacular.
[2014-02-25 20:40:45] ato: Last Call.
[2014-02-25 20:40:55] dude-x: i see.
[2014-02-25 20:41:05] dude-x: that is pretty good.
[2014-02-25 20:41:27] *lukeis really happy that switchTo parentFrame is going in :)'
[2014-02-25 20:41:40] FullTiltProspect, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-25 20:41:47] ato: Like saying, Salesforce/Facebook/Google/Mozilla/Microsoft has to reveal any patents they might have in the area within a certain time frame before the specification goes to Recommendation state.
[2014-02-25 20:42:12] ato: lukeis: Yeah.  But you had sound arguments!
[2014-02-25 20:42:33] dude-x: :thumbs up:
[2014-02-25 20:43:11] lukeis: the dropping of many locator types is going to be shocking for most :)
[2014-02-25 20:43:26] dude-x: like which?
[2014-02-25 20:43:28] ato: Yeah.  If they read the spec.
[2014-02-25 20:43:30] dude-x: name? link text?
[2014-02-25 20:43:38] ato: But it's not going to affect the language bindins.
[2014-02-25 20:43:41] ato: bindings.
[2014-02-25 20:43:47] lukeis: id, class name, tag name
[2014-02-25 20:43:53] lukeis: all go to css selectors
[2014-02-25 20:44:06] lukeis: but the language bindings will mask that change for users
[2014-02-25 20:44:12] ato: We're dropping all of those on a wire protocol/WebDriver spec level.
[2014-02-25 20:44:13] dude-x: but isn't byId built in?
[2014-02-25 20:44:21] dude-x: i see
[2014-02-25 20:44:35] lukeis: By.ID will still exist in the bindings… but it will just map to By.CSS
[2014-02-25 20:44:37] ato: Looking up an element by ID can be done by querySelectorAll through JS.
[2014-02-25 20:44:43] ato: Yeah.
[2014-02-25 20:44:56] lukeis: "myid" == "#myid"
[2014-02-25 20:45:18] ato: The point here being it removes a bunch of complexity in the core parts of the atoms and WebDrier.
[2014-02-25 20:45:21] ato: WebDriver.
[2014-02-25 20:45:27] lukeis: yes, certainly
[2014-02-25 20:45:40] dude-x: i think id, css selector, and xpath are the most useful
[2014-02-25 20:45:49] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-25 20:45:50] lukeis: ID is gone ;)
[2014-02-25 20:45:50] ato: dude-x: They'll still be there for end users.
[2014-02-25 20:45:56] dude-x: yeah
[2014-02-25 20:46:01] lukeis: css and xpath fully included
[2014-02-25 20:46:09] dude-x: but now that i know the implementation detail...
[2014-02-25 20:46:14] ato: XPath was, interestingly, contentious.
[2014-02-25 20:46:15] lukeis: (well, xpath will likely be 'limited' in IE)
[2014-02-25 20:46:20] ato: dude-x: Exactly.
[2014-02-25 20:46:33] ato: I'd hoped we could've gotten rid of XPath too.
[2014-02-25 20:46:52] ato: simonstewart's popularity argument didn't really resonate with me.
[2014-02-25 20:46:59] lukeis: that reminds me, i'll try to look up the xpath data from our tests tonight
[2014-02-25 20:47:16] dude-x: xpath is useful for reaching the parent element
[2014-02-25 20:47:18] ato: Yeah, that would be interesting.
[2014-02-25 20:47:47] ato: dude-x: Yup, that was about the only valid argument that was raised IMO.  My personal opinion would be to defer it to howcome and the CSS WG though
[2014-02-25 20:48:03] dude-x: unless browsers implement CSS4 parent syntax
[2014-02-25 20:48:07] dude-x: we will need xpath
[2014-02-25 20:48:10] ato: Yeah.
[2014-02-25 20:48:21] dude-x: i guess some people don't like xpath because people can do horrid xpaths
[2014-02-25 20:48:35] dude-x: but it's still very useful
[2014-02-25 20:48:38] ato: I regret not having prodded howcome enough whilst I was still at Opera. \-:
[2014-02-25 20:49:15] dude-x: xpath has a powerful syntax
[2014-02-25 20:49:21] ato: ::parent would've effectively killed XPath though.
[2014-02-25 20:49:31] lukeis: ato: so… many of these tests in the web-platform-tests are expected to fail right? :)
[2014-02-25 20:49:37] ato: Yes.
[2014-02-25 20:49:50] lukeis: do we have Basic http Auth in the spec?
[2014-02-25 20:49:56] ato: So that's the point Marc Fisher raised, and which I tried to articulate but kind of failed.
[2014-02-25 20:49:58] lukeis: just saw a test try it...
[2014-02-25 20:50:14] ato: The problem is that the selenium package in Python isn't compatible with the WebDriver spec.
[2014-02-25 20:50:23] lukeis: yeah
[2014-02-25 20:50:38] ato: (Marionette is though!  I intend to fix that this week.)
[2014-02-25 20:50:56] ato: Which is why it's so important we add the ability to use a driver by class.
[2014-02-25 20:51:17] ato: There's just a bunch of engineering work I need to do in Mozilla to make it possible to use Marionette like htat.
[2014-02-25 20:51:19] ato: that.
[2014-02-25 20:51:24] dude-x: also with xpath, you can match by text that isn't possible with CSS selecotrs
[2014-02-25 20:51:36] ato: Yup, that was the other one.
[2014-02-25 20:51:41] ato: And siblings, I believe.
[2014-02-25 20:51:46] ato: Or I guess siblings by nth.
[2014-02-25 20:51:51] dude-x: xpath has a powerful syntax like i said
[2014-02-25 20:52:06] jab416171_, quitting. (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[2014-02-25 20:52:26] dude-x: also not everyone uses selenium to write tests, they need something flexible like xpath to handle harder cases
[2014-02-25 20:53:06] ato: dude-x: So my argument was that client bindings could continue supporting XPath by prefering querySelectorAll where possible, but to fall back to injecting the Wicked XPath library when needed and using XPath.
[2014-02-25 20:53:23] ato: dude-x: simonstewart's counterargument was that it would be inefficient on mobile.
[2014-02-25 20:53:52] dude-x: webdriver is for all things!
[2014-02-25 20:53:56] dude-x: even if "mobile is the future"
[2014-02-25 20:54:03] dude-x: people still use PCs

[2014-02-25 20:54:42] lukeis: mobile at least is becoming a first class citizen in consideration ;)
[2014-02-25 20:55:41] tony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-25 20:56:15] ato: I'm looking forward to level 2.
[2014-02-25 20:56:31] ato: Adding mobile/device/fancy API support to WebDrive.r
[2014-02-25 20:56:37] lukeis: yeah… then mobile will be making some waves ;)
[2014-02-25 20:56:38] dude-x: doesn't the browser support xpath natively anyhow?
[2014-02-25 20:56:45] lukeis: not IE
[2014-02-25 20:56:52] dude-x: even IE9+?
[2014-02-25 20:56:54] lukeis: nope
[2014-02-25 20:56:59] lukeis: no versions
[2014-02-25 20:56:59] dude-x: interesting
[2014-02-25 20:57:07] ato: Selenium uses Wicked XPath for XPath in IE.
[2014-02-25 20:57:15] ato: But fortunately it's pretty fast.
[2014-02-25 20:57:15] lukeis: Wicked Good*

[2014-02-25 21:01:35] dude-x: well i guess i am paying for a monitor in the iMac 27
[2014-02-25 21:01:49] ato: T\-[0-9]{4} to be exact.

[2014-02-25 21:08:33] ato: But it doesn't matter.  Finishing the reviews in critic is what's important.
