[2014-02-24 07:50:00] malinus: But I still can't figure out how to know how to get the full height of the page. Well in JS I can do self.innerHeight(), but how would I get that returned to the python script, so I know when we are at the bottom of the page?
[2014-02-24 07:50:21] jimevans: malinus: use javascript to get document height?
[2014-02-24 07:50:40] malinus: jimevans, yes. But how would I return that to my python script?

[2014-02-24 07:52:54] malinus: nirvdrum, thanks a bunch. And you too jimevans :)
[2014-02-24 07:53:20] nirvdrum: malinus: If you don't have an explicit return statement in execute_script, an implicit void return will be inserted.

[2014-02-24 07:53:48] nirvdrum: Best of luck.  It took me way too long to get scrolling and stitching working in Chrome.

[2014-02-24 07:54:00] nirvdrum: And they removed some webkit property I was using at one point, so that was fun.

[2014-02-24 07:54:25] jimevans: yeah, i really wish the chrome guys would get their act together on screenshots.
[2014-02-24 07:54:26] nirvdrum: malinus: After every scroll operation, I'd also add driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollTop;")
[2014-02-24 07:54:33] malinus: nirvdrum, sounds horrifying :/. I thought this was a 10min job. Would you happen to have the source of yours?
[2014-02-24 07:54:51] malinus: nirvdrum, why so?
[2014-02-24 07:54:52] nirvdrum: malinus: I ran into a really shitty issue where chromedriver will return immediately but not actually scroll right away.
[2014-02-24 07:55:05] malinus: nirvdrum, sleep(5) :)
[2014-02-24 07:55:06] nirvdrum: If I ask for its position, it'll flush the scroll command.
[2014-02-24 07:55:24] nirvdrum: It's not a matter of sleeping.  I tried that.
[2014-02-24 07:55:38] nirvdrum: Something gets screwed up in its internal command queue I think.
[2014-02-24 07:56:00] nirvdrum: It was really sucky to track down because every time I asked for the scroll position, it would scroll.
[2014-02-24 07:56:08] nirvdrum: If I didn't ask for the scroll position, it might not.
[2014-02-24 07:56:17] nirvdrum: Eventually I gave in and just ask for the scroll position all the time.
[2014-02-24 07:56:24] malinus: heh
[2014-02-24 07:56:29] malinus: t-thanks chrome
[2014-02-24 07:56:41] nirvdrum: But it's fun when your debug tool affects the results, when it shouldn't.
[2014-02-24 07:57:10] malinus: nirvdrum, but yeah. all this information is very useful. What other issues did you have? And what got removed, since your script stopped working?
[2014-02-24 07:57:19] nirvdrum: malinus: I'll need to extract it from this project.  It's kinda tightly ingrained to mogotest.com right now.
[2014-02-24 07:57:54] nirvdrum: I'm not not sharing it because it's a competitive advantage.  I just need to extract it since I don't treat screenshots the way most selenium users do.
[2014-02-24 07:58:14] nirvdrum: And my code is all Ruby, so you'd have to convert it to Python.
[2014-02-24 07:58:43] malinus: nirvdrum, it's your call. If you have the time I would appreciate.
[2014-02-24 07:59:44] nirvdrum: malinus: WebKit used to have a height property on the document.
[2014-02-24 08:00:12] jimevans: nirvdrum: that might be nice library code to have thrown up somewhere that people can take it and translate it as needed.
[2014-02-24 08:00:15] nirvdrum: It was more reliable than body.scrollHeight.  But they got rid of it.
[2014-02-24 08:00:17] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-24 08:00:46] nirvdrum: malinus: The other part is I use the same scroll / stitch code for iOS with slightly branching paths.
[2014-02-24 08:01:05] nirvdrum: So there's crap in there for cutting out the address bar and dealing with device pixels.
[2014-02-24 08:01:34] nirvdrum: jimevans: Yeah.  I've been meaning to.  Typing has just been really painful lately.  My Dragon stuff is coming along though.
[2014-02-24 08:01:43] malinus: nirvdrum, have you tried doing the same thing for IE?
[2014-02-24 08:01:55] malinus: nirvdrum, I mean, taking screenshots
[2014-02-24 08:02:07] nirvdrum: malinus: No need.  The IEDriver screenshots work the way I want.
[2014-02-24 08:02:19] nirvdrum: The original version of SnapsIE did do scroll and stitch though.
[2014-02-24 08:02:40] nirvdrum: Which reminds me.  My Chrome stuff doesn't scroll horizontally.

[2014-02-24 08:03:29] malinus: jimevans, nirvdrum, the problem for me is (with IE driver), that even though it works on my VM windows with IE perfectly, my client gets a black rectangle for the part of the website that is not visible in the port.
[2014-02-24 08:03:36] nirvdrum: jimevans: I've handled an awful lot of screenshots in that yet to run into a real world use case where the IE driver limitations are hit.

[2014-02-24 08:04:03] selbot2_: ok!
[2014-02-24 08:04:03] nirvdrum: malinus: Is it flash or an applet?
[2014-02-24 08:04:16] jimevans: nirvdrum: that's fair, as long as you're aware of the 32-bit/64-bit issues with screenshots for IE10+
[2014-02-24 08:04:19] malinus: nirvdrum, it's python script that runs selenium.
[2014-02-24 08:04:40] nirvdrum: jimevans: Ahh, I meant the 64K x 64K dimensions.
[2014-02-24 08:04:43] malinus: nirvdrum, website he tested is yahoo.com
[2014-02-24 08:04:45] nirvdrum: malinus: I mean on the page.
[2014-02-24 08:05:04] malinus: nirvdrum, and it works for me perfectly. it's only flash it seems.
[2014-02-24 08:05:27] nirvdrum: Flash renders out of process and can't be captured by the browser.
[2014-02-24 08:05:39] nirvdrum: There's not much you can do there other than taking an OS level screenshot.
[2014-02-24 08:06:12] malinus: nirvdrum, I'm telling you it works fine on my computer. but on his, he gets this black rectangle outside of the view (the dimensions are fitting though).
[2014-02-24 08:06:13] nirvdrum: I think anyway. It's been a while since I've looked at that.
[2014-02-24 08:06:34] nirvdrum: Can you share that screenshot?
[2014-02-24 08:06:37] jimevans: malinus: what version of IE?
[2014-02-24 08:06:54] jimevans: and what version of the IE driver is he running?
[2014-02-24 08:07:29] malinus: jimevans, I gave him the newest version of IE driver. He is on windows 7, so probably IE 9 I guess?
[2014-02-24 08:08:06] jimevans: malinus: it's important to know, because of #5876

[2014-02-24 08:08:58] malinus: jimevans, well I'm giving him the same IE driver version I'm using myself, so I can't see how that could be the issue.
[2014-02-24 08:09:32] jimevans: if he's running IE10, and you're using the 32-bit IE driver, it might be.
[2014-02-24 08:09:38] nirvdrum: malinus: Because you might be running 32-bit OS and he might be running 64-bit.
[2014-02-24 08:10:10] malinus: nirvdrum, that is the case, yes. Which IE driver should I give him to fix it?
[2014-02-24 08:10:24] malinus: nirvdrum, should giving him the 64-bit fix it?
[2014-02-24 08:10:33] *nirvdrum hands the floor over to jimevans.'
[2014-02-24 08:10:49] nirvdrum: But you should probably read that bug report in any event.
[2014-02-24 08:11:00] jimevans: malinus: it would fix *that* problem, yes. but it would likely cause a raft of others. do you do any calls to send_keys?
[2014-02-24 08:12:15] malinus: jimevans, no I don't call for send keys. I'm only using selenium to take the screenshot. What kind of other problems could it cause?
[2014-02-24 08:12:52] jimevans: if you're not using the send_keys method, then you'll be fine using the 64-bit IE driver.
[2014-02-24 08:13:33] jimevans: i'm thinking specifically of #5116 and #3072

[2014-02-24 11:17:19] dogarrhea: deleting = add something to a blacklist in the database
[2014-02-24 11:18:14] wilhelm: I'm not sure I understand how your app works.
[2014-02-24 11:18:47] wilhelm: Is the problem that deleting an entry is always impossible, or that you won't know which entry to delete?
[2014-02-24 11:18:57] dogarrhea: we add text to a textbox.  It gets whitelisted.  We remove it to "cleanup" now the text is blacklisted

[2014-02-24 14:35:36] dogarrhea: how does dev ops know what all of salesforce is doing anyways
[2014-02-24 14:35:36] jimevans: dogarrhea: salesforce does it by isolating the data. everything in salesforce is based on the "org", and tests get their own org.
[2014-02-24 14:36:20] jimevans: because salesforce has been very open and vocal about their testing strategy, giving "how we do it" presentations at conferences
[2014-02-24 14:36:56] dogarrhea: i see the last one was the 12th of this month
[2014-02-24 14:37:04] dogarrhea: when you say "isolating data"
[2014-02-24 14:37:29] dogarrhea: what exactly is meant by "isolating data"
[2014-02-24 14:38:06] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-24 14:38:12] jimevans: one database, many "org" objects within that database. each org is independent of the others.
[2014-02-24 14:38:25] jimevans: and can be manipulated without affecting the others.
[2014-02-24 14:38:41] jimevans: thus a whole new database isn't needed when a new test starts, just a new org.

[2014-02-24 14:42:31] jimevans: but the bottom line is that they're independent of each other.
[2014-02-24 14:42:50] jimevans: and a new test can just use a fresh org; it doesn't need a whole new database.
[2014-02-24 14:43:58] dogarrhea_: the other day we found an issue where one user's content went to another "org" and it was a big "orgy"
[2014-02-24 14:44:38] dogarrhea_: we thought this issue was some out of the box software doing document conversion wrong and spent a lot of time on it... then we started seeing each others contents across environments and it was ugh.

[2014-02-24 14:46:14] dogarrhea_: presentational bugs in each browser can be more easily identified on totally separate environments.  Right now, we don't know WHAT fails when something happens
[2014-02-24 14:47:08] dogarrhea_: "can you replicate it?" "no its random"
[2014-02-24 14:48:16] barancev: I doubt it is possible to target such issues (environment leaking) with autotests
[2014-02-24 14:48:23] dogarrhea_: basically, you're doing too much on one environment with "orgs" "orgies" or what not

[2014-02-24 14:50:36] chrismcmahon: heh. I've been doing browser tests since it was possible to do browser tests, and most of the bugs they turn up are not what the test was explicitly designed to check for.  (I talked about that a bit at the Agile2009 conf)
[2014-02-24 14:52:20] dogarrhea_: for example, some data could cross over.  IE8 doesn't expect this data and renders only half the screen (true story).  "HEY OUR ANGULAR JS IS BROKEN. FIX IT THERE"
