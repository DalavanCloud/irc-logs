[2014-02-19 07:15:00] dimacus: ttyp0: well what do you mean it's acting differntly? what was the behavior
[2014-02-19 07:15:29] ttyp0: mouseclick gives me separate window that I can drag to 2nd display. ctrl+alt+s launches IDE as a part of the browser window (stealing some of my screen space, kinda like if you opened up the bookmarks sidebar)

[2014-02-19 07:16:00] dimacus: on mac it acts consistently
[2014-02-19 07:16:11] ttyp0: mmh then it does sound like a bug

[2014-02-19 07:17:51] *dimacus doing informal survey'
[2014-02-19 07:18:18] ttyp0: dimacus, I use the IDE for quick'n'dirty throwaway stuff and for building the skeleton of more comprehensive scripts through record
[2014-02-19 07:18:39] ttyp0: after that, export and add conditional statements, looping etc.
[2014-02-19 07:19:00] dimacus: interesting, what language do you export to?
[2014-02-19 07:19:25] ttyp0: varies. php before but now I'm pressured to use java since the project doesn't want stuff in several different languages, which I can totally understand. :)
[2014-02-19 07:20:10] dimacus: yeah i hear ya… i noticed that if you write tests in language that the devs used to write project, they are more likeley to contribute/fix/debug tests with you
[2014-02-19 07:20:35] *dimacus was on java project where tests were written in ruby, 0 support from dev team'

[2014-02-19 08:42:58] jimevans: i really don't care. as long as the binaries are available *somewhere* and i can push to that location when i have the release bacon, it doesn't matter a whit to me.
[2014-02-19 08:42:58] lukeis: we can certainly put more pressure by creating the release tag, updating the api docs / change logs and then I can push to maven central
[2014-02-19 08:43:10] lukeis: to be the first time in history the maven build is out before everything else! ;)
[2014-02-19 08:43:14] jimevans: i'm prepping the version update changelist now.

[2014-02-19 11:12:28] Gita_: Hi All. I would like to quit Safari application from Selenium, instead of just quitting the driver (that closes only one browser window). Any suggestions to kill Safari browser from Selenium code ?
[2014-02-19 11:12:42] simonstewart: Right. So there are two options I think are sane:
[2014-02-19 11:12:46] simonstewart: 1) GH releases
[2014-02-19 11:12:53] simonstewart: 2) A separate repo for releases
[2014-02-19 11:13:08] simonstewart: The google storage thing is an option iff non-googlers can write to it
[2014-02-19 11:13:23] jimevans: here
[2014-02-19 11:13:33] simonstewart: jimevans: :) Good
[2014-02-19 11:14:01] simonstewart: jleyba, as I understand it, the ability for even selected non-googlers to write to google storage isn't an option, right?
[2014-02-19 11:14:27] jleyba: simonstewart: it's not a firm no, but at this time, that is the case
[2014-02-19 11:14:43] simonstewart: OK
[2014-02-19 11:14:52] simonstewart: So I think that takes it off the table. Agreed?

[2014-02-19 11:15:04] simonstewart: "off the table" -> "it's not a realistic option"
[2014-02-19 11:15:11] jleyba: ok
[2014-02-19 11:15:31] simonstewart: So, GH releases pushes us closer to moving the source of truth to GH
[2014-02-19 11:15:45] simonstewart: Whereas a new GC repo is just damnably clunky
[2014-02-19 11:15:52] lukeis: yep

[2014-02-19 11:29:44] jleyba: simonstewart: so I understand, the proposal is to create a new repo per release?

[2014-02-19 15:00:35] lukeis: dogarrhea: re-read the docs please :)
[2014-02-19 15:00:56] jimevans: webdriverwait waits for the condition to be true *up until* the timeout. it exits early if the condition is met.
[2014-02-19 15:01:11] lukeis: and it tries the condition first (before doing any sleeps)
[2014-02-19 15:01:23] dogarrhea: this is a bug with bootstrap animations
[2014-02-19 15:01:26] dogarrhea: it doesn't work that way
[2014-02-19 15:01:47] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-19 15:02:40] jimevans: on the other hand, webdriverwait only handles NoSuchElementException by default. it doesn't touch StaleElementException unless you modify it somewhat.
[2014-02-19 15:02:58] lukeis: the modification is easy to do (i do it ;) )
[2014-02-19 15:03:14] jimevans: yes. it's just a difference in building the wait.
[2014-02-19 15:03:19] dogarrhea: stale elements due to bootstrap animations kek

[2014-02-19 15:04:49] lukeis: android gets TONS of stale element exceptions in selendroid… so I deal with it with WebDriverWait (also ignoring stale element exception) and waiting for things to be 'clickable' rather than 'present'

[2014-02-19 15:43:34] simonstewart: Are you using 32 bit Windows?
[2014-02-19 15:43:50] jimevans: i'm not, but there are rumours afoot about build slaves that might.
