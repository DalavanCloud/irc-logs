[2014-02-05 05:04:08] Dave_B_: hmmm, https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/wiki/Selenide-vs-Selenium is very unconvincing, seems to me that they mostly are just dragging out the webdriver examples to make it look like more than a character count difference
[2014-02-05 05:04:39] Dave_B_: Quite possibly there is lots more to it than that, but if so they should make that clearer
[2014-02-05 05:05:24] andy_seit: The https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/wiki/Selenide-vs-Selenium page was my favourite.  And the TMTOWTDI api is a particular highlight.
[2014-02-05 05:05:52] andy_seit: Yeah their examples are purposefully contrived
[2014-02-05 05:06:33] barancev: Dave_B_: syntax sugar is about character count, yes
[2014-02-05 05:07:11] Dave_B_: 'Selenide = a better Selenium' â€¦. not just 'Selenide hiding the word driver from you'
[2014-02-05 05:08:11] *Dave_B_ is being harsh, but having ripped similar things out of projects in the past for being all risk and no reward I need to see a clear benefit'
[2014-02-05 05:08:21] barancev: Dave_B_: can you agree with the thesis "Watir WebDriver: the most elegant way to use WebDriver with ruby." ?
[2014-02-05 05:08:38] Dave_B_: haha
[2014-02-05 05:08:42] Dave_B_: ok you have a point ;)
[2014-02-05 05:08:44] barancev: http://watirwebdriver.com/ -- the very first sentence
[2014-02-05 05:09:47] andy_seit: I find Selenide far too complex, I'm going to distill it down to what users really care about.  ("button").Click(); ("textbox").Send("x");
[2014-02-05 05:09:48] barancev: it's all about API style, not features
[2014-02-05 05:10:05] andy_seit: For everything else, they can use selenium
[2014-02-05 05:10:16] andy_seit: It shall be called 'Snide'
[2014-02-05 05:10:39] barancev: andy_seit: please do :)
[2014-02-05 05:11:48] andy_seit: Everything will be located by id, and I'll fix all of seleniums ajax problems with a 10 second timeout on each call
[2014-02-05 05:12:36] barancev: andy_seit: oh! you should like the idea to deprecate implicit waits!
[2014-02-05 05:12:58] Dave_B_: i had a colleague who set a 60 second implicit wait at the start of any code he wrote
[2014-02-05 05:13:31] Dave_B_: any webdriver code, i mean
[2014-02-05 05:13:39] Dave_B_: was awesome :/
[2014-02-05 05:16:16] andy_seit: barancev: Ah, I thought that might be coming.
[2014-02-05 05:16:58] barancev: it's strange but people find value in implicit waits
[2014-02-05 05:17:03] barancev: that stops us
[2014-02-05 05:18:33] andy_seit: Yeah, I can understand why.  Especially when you have large automation codebases and testers with limited experience working on it.

[2014-02-05 08:45:25] jimevans: Ragnaroek: two possibilities.
[2014-02-05 08:45:26] Ragnaroek: any ideas what could be causing this?
[2014-02-05 08:45:55] Ragnaroek: the elements are present (in Firefox) and there is no Ajax on the page
[2014-02-05 08:45:56] jimevans: first, the IE driver is a piece of crap. second, IE is just plain slower than firefox, and you need to wait for the element to be present on the page.
[2014-02-05 08:46:37] simonstewart: jimevans: I think you're being too hard on the IE driver. When I put it together, it was genuinely awful
[2014-02-05 08:47:06] jimevans: note that the fact that there's "no ajax on the page" doesn't guarantee that there isn't javascript manipulating the DOM.
[2014-02-05 08:47:28] jimevans: simonstewart: that's a preemptive "the IE driver is a buggy, unstable piece of crap" comment.
[2014-02-05 08:47:35] Ragnaroek: I configured an implicit wait of 30 seconds, should be way enough
[2014-02-05 08:48:15] jimevans: Ragnaroek: okay, then you'll need to provide more info. like an example page where this happens, along with some test code.
[2014-02-05 08:48:18] Ragnaroek: we had this problem with IE from the beginning
[2014-02-05 08:48:26] jimevans: (i'll leave the editorializing about implicit waits for another time)

[2014-02-05 08:49:41] jimevans: so i can safely say it's not broken for every user of every website everywhere
[2014-02-05 08:50:23] simonstewart: barancev: we start when we start. Guess the first thing to do is chat to the main devs and figure out the best way to land their code in our tree
[2014-02-05 08:50:53] jimevans: Ragnaroek: however, i'm shooting in the dark because i've got no idea what kind of locators you're using. for example, very long and brittle xpaths may not be identical in IE and firefox, because of the differences in the layout engines.
[2014-02-05 08:51:09] simonstewart: barancev: which isn't a terribly helpful answer

[2014-02-05 12:09:57] jimevans: barancev: are you saying that the options class is not discoverable, or that the options that can be set are not discoverable?
[2014-02-05 12:10:52] barancev: options are not discoverable
[2014-02-05 12:11:15] jleyba: how so?
[2014-02-05 12:11:24] jleyba: FirefoxDriver(FirefoxOptions)
[2014-02-05 12:11:29] jleyba: ChromeDriver(ChromeOptions)
[2014-02-05 12:11:37] jleyba: would be right there in the constructor signature
[2014-02-05 12:11:54] AutomatedTester: jleyba: but vim doesnt show me the constructor signature
[2014-02-05 12:12:00] AutomatedTester: as well as notepad
[2014-02-05 12:12:02] barancev: if you want to add a _new_ option
[2014-02-05 12:12:15] jleyba: AutomatedTester: price you pay for writing java in vim and notepad >:)
[2014-02-05 12:12:21] AutomatedTester: :D
[2014-02-05 12:12:34] jleyba: barancev: who adds a new option? the selenium project or sauce?
[2014-02-05 12:12:47] jimevans: barancev: if you're adding a new option, you're on your own. it's incumbent upon us to keep the options as up-to-date as possible.
[2014-02-05 12:12:50] barancev: a thirt party
[2014-02-05 12:12:59] jleyba: Chrome/FirefoxOptions would have a generic setOption(key, value) method
[2014-02-05 12:13:26] barancev: yes, a generic method
[2014-02-05 12:14:36] barancev: that's very like to the curent capabilities class
[2014-02-05 12:14:51] jimevans: and it would be ridiculously easy for any so-inclined third-party to create code to return the correct options class.
[2014-02-05 12:15:06] jimevans: barancev: except it's not!
[2014-02-05 12:15:40] barancev: let's just rename it to options :)
[2014-02-05 12:15:41] jimevans: the current capabilities class has no ability to validate input for appropriate type safety. none. zip. nada.
[2014-02-05 12:16:12] barancev: we can add guards to the curremt capabilities implementation
[2014-02-05 12:16:31] jimevans: not easily.
[2014-02-05 12:16:52] jleyba: DesiredCapabilities is in org.openqa.selenium.remote
[2014-02-05 12:17:03] jleyba: you can't add type safety without a dependency on org.openqa.selenium.chrome
[2014-02-05 12:17:15] jleyba: which already depends on remote, so you would introduce circular dependencies?
[2014-02-05 12:18:02] barancev: ah, I see, you want to put browser-specific guargs to the browser-specific packages
[2014-02-05 12:18:14] barancev: *guards
[2014-02-05 12:19:08] barancev: so we have to create a hierarchy of classes
[2014-02-05 12:20:00] barancev: and if sauce wants to add a new capability they are to use a generic method, they can't create a kind of SauceOptions mixin
[2014-02-05 12:20:33] jleyba: Sauce is a commercial company
[2014-02-05 12:20:42] barancev: or... let's create a bunch of optiosn classes without inheritance
[2014-02-05 12:20:57] jimevans: that's the state the .NET bindings have now.
[2014-02-05 12:21:00] barancev: new FireforDriver(Options options...)
[2014-02-05 12:21:00] jimevans: java too for that matter.
[2014-02-05 12:21:35] barancev: new FireforDriver(generalOptions, firefoxOptions, sauceOptions)
[2014-02-05 12:21:37] jimevans: barancev: what you're missing, i think, is that at the wire protocol level, these things get serialized to capabilities anyway.
[2014-02-05 12:21:59] barancev: so what? we are talking about API, no?
[2014-02-05 12:22:10] jimevans: yeah, we are.
[2014-02-05 12:22:37] barancev: yes, some of them will be serialized, some are executable options to be passed to a driver server
[2014-02-05 12:23:39] jimevans: yeah, i've glossed over that particular bit. i really need to fix that for .net.

[2014-02-05 12:43:18] lukeis: third party (sauce) can publish their own jar for users to include
[2014-02-05 12:43:27] nirvdrum: jleyba: What happens when something is a common option but not supported by a driver?  E.g., proxy settings.  Is the idea it just does whatever desired capabilities does today?
[2014-02-05 12:43:55] simonstewart: I'm assuming that these are desired capabiltiiles
[2014-02-05 12:44:21] lukeis: all looks the same to me ;)
[2014-02-05 12:44:46] nirvdrum: simonstewart: I guess it's just weird to have a static method that would potentially ignore what you send it.
[2014-02-05 12:44:51] jleyba: jimevans: extended my gist to handle the sauce case (requires them to publish their own java lib)
[2014-02-05 12:45:17] nirvdrum: Whereas I could buy that more if you used the set() form.
[2014-02-05 12:45:29] jleyba: nirvdrum: if you ask for a proxy and the browser can't do it, I think the driver should fail to create the session
[2014-02-05 12:45:35] lukeis: jleyba doesn't use saucelabs apparently ;) user/password is in the url

[2014-02-05 12:46:33] jleyba: lukeis: w/e.. if they want users to save credentials in source, that's their deal :)
[2014-02-05 12:46:33] nirvdrum: simonstewart: If I'm using a discoverable interface, it's strange to me that I could call setProxy(proxy) and have that be ignored (desired capabilities semantics aside).
[2014-02-05 12:47:07] stackedsax, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-05 12:47:07] lukeis: i don't save the password in sourceâ€¦ i dynamically create my url
[2014-02-05 12:47:15] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Whereas if I called set("proxy", proxy) I think there's a stronger argument that I requested a capability that just doesn't exist for that driver.  So no-opping may make sense.
[2014-02-05 12:47:39] nirvdrum: Of course, I prefer jleyba's approach and just raise an error.
[2014-02-05 12:47:42] jleyba: nirvdrum: I'm in favor of dropping "required capabilities" and increasing the strictness of "desired capabilities".  if I desired a proxy and you can't give it to me, fail.
[2014-02-05 12:48:18] nirvdrum: Yeah, I could buy that.
[2014-02-05 12:48:48] nirvdrum: Or rather, that's what I preferred from the outset.  But it seemed people wanted two levels of semantics.  So I was also okay with the required capabilities concession.
[2014-02-05 12:48:59] simonstewart: I'm totally unsure what the "increased strictness" about desired capabilities would be
[2014-02-05 12:49:45] nirvdrum: If you request a capability and it doesn't match, don't create a session.
[2014-02-05 12:50:14] nirvdrum: I guess that would make it a required capability with a different name.
[2014-02-05 12:50:37] simonstewart: This is where I get to ask if people are aware of the nature of desire
[2014-02-05 12:50:46] simonstewart: I'll try and avoid making it sound creepy
[2014-02-05 12:51:11] nirvdrum: I think we've all heard the argument :-D
[2014-02-05 12:51:34] nirvdrum: The retort is usually the principle of least surprise.
[2014-02-05 12:52:05] nirvdrum: Which is exacerbated by the driver not being required to return all the capabilities you desired, too.
[2014-02-05 12:52:35] nirvdrum: If I desire a proxy and the driver never returns the proxy in its capabilities, it's simply not possible to determine whether I'm running with a proxy or not.
[2014-02-05 12:56:48] jimevans: simonstewart: people don't get the 'desired' part of the api.
[2014-02-05 12:57:07] nirvdrum: jimevans: Or they don't want to settle for second best.
[2014-02-05 12:57:29] jimevans: or more correctly, their desire is give me what i want, or don't give me anything at all.
[2014-02-05 12:57:41] nirvdrum: Right.

[2014-02-05 13:03:57] jleyba: jimevans: the implicit wait should abort the moment there is a stale element
[2014-02-05 13:04:13] jimevans: yes, it should.
[2014-02-05 13:04:15] jleyba: b/c the wait is on finding a new element. has nothing to do about whether the search context is valid

[2014-02-05 13:07:26] lukeis: Ragnaroek: typically means you have a timing issue in your scriptâ€¦ likely the page is finding the element while unloading the last page or something
[2014-02-05 13:07:47] lukeis: "what's wrong with implicit waits"? themselves :)
[2014-02-05 13:07:56] lukeis: try to not use them if you can

[2014-02-05 13:10:07] jimevans: there was an amusing twitter thread i saw with jim holmes about the term "explicit wait"
[2014-02-05 13:10:42] jimevans: because to a random (not webdriver-savvy) developer, "explicit wait" == "thread.sleep()"
[2014-02-05 13:11:03] simonstewart: We should just call 'em "waits" and "the waits you don't use"
[2014-02-05 13:11:11] jimevans: "you told me you wanted to explicitly wait! that's how i explicitly tell the system to wait"
[2014-02-05 13:12:21] jimevans: by the by, simonstewart, i'm not sure i agree with "3.0 should be a drop-in replacement for 2.x".
[2014-02-05 13:12:22] lukeis: simonstewart: which are which? to our users "waits you don't use" are the explicit ones ;)  "waits" and "waits that shouldn't be used" ;)
[2014-02-05 13:12:31] barancev: simonstewart: jleyba: why wrapping Options objects is better than passing to a driver constructor several independent Options instances?
[2014-02-05 13:13:16] simonstewart: jimevans: because?
[2014-02-05 13:14:26] jimevans: for .net, at least, there are places in the API that i findâ€¦ inelegant. a major version number change seems like the best time to change that.
[2014-02-05 13:14:41] jimevans: and given our track record, 4.0 is likely to be a loooong time away.
[2014-02-05 13:14:48] simonstewart: My plan with the last 2.0 releases is to start adding the APIs we'd like to offer in parallel
[2014-02-05 13:14:50] jimevans: (and i know few people care about .net)
[2014-02-05 13:15:03] simonstewart: The final 2.0 release will deprecate everything we plan to delete
[2014-02-05 13:15:45] jimevans: so we'll have parallel releases for a bit.
[2014-02-05 13:16:01] jimevans: i missed that somehow in the plans.
[2014-02-05 13:16:07] simonstewart: Not really.
[2014-02-05 13:16:21] simonstewart: It's that the last 2.x releases will be laying the groundwork for what we need
[2014-02-05 13:16:24] simonstewart: for 3.0
[2014-02-05 13:17:02] jimevans: i guess we need to start putting a stake in the ground for that.
[2014-02-05 13:17:28] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the parallel releases part has never been mentioned
[2014-02-05 13:17:40] simonstewart: That's because we're not doing parallel releases
[2014-02-05 13:17:55] simonstewart: and why making a laundry list of changes to the APIs isn't terribly helpful

[2014-02-05 13:21:10] simonstewart: We'll add that in 2.x
[2014-02-05 13:21:18] simonstewart: Additions aren't breaking changes
[2014-02-05 13:21:49] AutomatedTester: capability names are not standard

[2014-02-05 13:22:52] jimevans: are the "standard" capabilities being spec'ed?

[2014-02-05 13:26:15] AutomatedTester: they are spread through the spec

[2014-02-05 13:31:16] AutomatedTester: and is non-normative
[2014-02-05 13:33:07] jimevans: yeah, that's what i meant.
[2014-02-05 13:33:51] jimevans: is there any webdriver implementation that implements page loading strategy as specified?
[2014-02-05 13:33:55] jimevans: i think the answer is no
[2014-02-05 13:34:05] AutomatedTester: barancev has started on FirefoxDriver

[2014-02-05 13:42:00] jleyba: jimevans: in PageLoadingTest
[2014-02-05 13:42:19] barancev: that is conservative (waits for frames)
[2014-02-05 13:42:34] barancev: yes, tests are added to PageLoadingTests
