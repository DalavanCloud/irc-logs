[2014-02-14 05:31:11] garndt: Sorry, you said "implicit wait", which in this case is different than explicitly polling for only that element for a certain amount of time.  Implicit waits are set at the driver level and affect finding *every* element.

[2014-02-14 05:32:48] garndt: and why is that a bit annoying? Just curious.  Humans have the built in mechanisms to wait for an expected condition to happen...We would wait for the dropdown to have the element before proceeding.  WebDriverWait does that, but for the script.
