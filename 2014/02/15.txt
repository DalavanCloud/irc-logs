[2014-02-15 13:38:30] dokosatchii: tag*
[2014-02-15 13:38:35] dokosatchii: not sure what you mean by trace it
[2014-02-15 13:39:16] p_l: execute your code under debugger, watch what is happening
[2014-02-15 13:40:50] dokosatchii: Sorry if this is so noobish but
[2014-02-15 13:40:59] dokosatchii: the debugger in the browser?

[2014-02-15 13:43:55] dokosatchii: no problem
[2014-02-15 13:44:12] dokosatchii: so I should look into getting it to work with fames?
