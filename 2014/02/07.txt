[2014-02-07 09:29:25] jimevans: Zeusdude: nothing, in and of itself. in fact, none of those suggestions are entirely out of line for the proper environment. it's just not appropriate for *every* environment.
[2014-02-07 09:30:22] jimevans: and yeah, ato, you *could* get a way with fewer comments or docs, in some cases. self-documenting code, and all that. i don't think it's necessarily the approach i'd like to take, but i could see it in some cases.
[2014-02-07 09:31:11] ato: My take on it is that it's usually a reason why the comment is there in the first place.
[2014-02-07 09:31:21] ato: And sure, people have different practices when it comes to writing them.

[2014-02-07 11:01:47] jimevans: nope. makes perfect sense, once you understand what's going on under the covers.
[2014-02-07 11:02:18] jimevans: my comment at the bottom of the report has all the gory details
[2014-02-07 11:03:08] jimevans: and my "proper fix" is really more complicated than that.

[2014-02-07 11:04:02] jimevans: because to use a hook in a process not-your-own, you must have the hook procedure in a dll, not in an exe. so not only would i need a separate executable, i'd also need yet another dll to use to load into the IE process space.
[2014-02-07 11:04:48] jimevans: it's a charlie-foxtrot of epic proportions.
[2014-02-07 11:07:43] ato: wtf.
[2014-02-07 11:08:24] ato: I see now why programmers working on backwards-engineering on Windows become good at what they do.
[2014-02-07 11:08:34] lukeis: i'm often very glad I don't have to deal with IE ;)
[2014-02-07 11:08:55] ato: Aren't you two colleagues now?
[2014-02-07 11:09:01] lukeis: yes
[2014-02-07 11:09:06] ato: jimevans: Draft him in!
[2014-02-07 11:09:09] ato: Go on!
[2014-02-07 11:09:10] lukeis: on the same team even
[2014-02-07 11:09:15] jimevans: if i just had a reliable effing way to simulate user input, that would resolve 80+% of the problems with the IE driver.
[2014-02-07 11:09:21] lukeis: if he does, i'll have him work on android ;)
[2014-02-07 11:09:55] ato: jimevans: The way Firefox does this is not very impressive.
[2014-02-07 11:10:12] ato: (Presto) Opera's implementation is the best I've seen so far.

[2014-02-07 11:10:20] dogarrhea_: kek
[2014-02-07 11:10:37] dogarrhea_: the hospital where Steve jobs pulled his mask off and said "this mask is uncomfortable" uses ie8
[2014-02-07 11:10:39] jimevans: but either a: windows blocks me because it doesn't give me what i need, or b: IE tries really hard to obscure itself.
[2014-02-07 11:10:44] dogarrhea_: and that hospital is Stanford hospital.
[2014-02-07 11:11:06] dogarrhea_: so it's important... lives are at stake
[2014-02-07 11:11:35] jimevans: i'm tempted to just quit. i wonder if anyone would notice.
[2014-02-07 11:11:39] lukeis: well, at least it's IE8 and not 10+ ;)
[2014-02-07 11:11:48] garndt: dogarrhea_: I am all too familiar with the browsers hospital systems use unfortunately :(
[2014-02-07 11:12:04] garndt: well, I should say browser, not browsers, and that browser being an outdated version of IE
[2014-02-07 11:12:07] ato: jimevans: The sad fact is that I think many would.
[2014-02-07 11:12:43] ato: You see all these consultancies pushing web based apps these days into governmental entities.
[2014-02-07 11:13:02] ato: With an infrastructure, like dogarrhea_ says, is based on pretty ancient version of IE.
[2014-02-07 11:13:03] garndt: jimevans: does the iedriver project still require visual studio 10? Just curious.

[2014-02-07 11:13:26] ato: It scares me.
[2014-02-07 11:13:58] jimevans: i threaten to do so from time to time when people bitch about how bad/buggy/unstable the IE driver is. my attitude is starting to be, "if you think it's so damned easy, *you* turn your hands to actually contribute something rather than just bitching about it."
[2014-02-07 11:14:01] jimevans: garndt: yes.
[2014-02-07 11:14:28] jimevans: garndt: but mostly because of the firefox native events libraries for windows.
[2014-02-07 11:14:44] ato: jimevans: We should get our arses into gear and finish that spec.
[2014-02-07 11:14:44] jimevans: i *could* separate them out, but that way lay madness.
[2014-02-07 11:15:20] garndt: hrm, so the iedriverserver relies on firefox native event libraries?
[2014-02-07 11:15:26] garndt: sorry, I'm not intentionally being dumb
[2014-02-07 11:15:27] ttyp0: madness is not all bad, it's liberating
[2014-02-07 11:15:30] jimevans: garndt: no, that's not what i said.
[2014-02-07 11:15:31] ttyp0: *wink*

[2014-02-07 11:16:14] jimevans: garndt: both the firefox binaries and the IE driver binaries are built as projects in the same visual studio solution.
[2014-02-07 11:16:34] tony1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-07 11:16:39] jimevans: and the firefox binaries are statically linked to the .lib files provided by the mozilla gecko sdk
[2014-02-07 11:16:55] jimevans: which are built and depend on visual studio 2010
[2014-02-07 11:17:24] garndt: ok, thanks, I understand now
[2014-02-07 11:18:04] brma, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-07 11:18:27] jimevans: yeah, the choices are to a) split out the c++ projects into separate vs solutions, each of which requires a different version of visual studio, b) rig up our build process to build the gecko sdk from scratch, or c) just stick with VS2010.
[2014-02-07 11:18:35] jimevans: path of least resistance.
[2014-02-07 11:18:51] garndt: yup
[2014-02-07 11:18:52] garndt: got it
[2014-02-07 11:19:13] garndt: hrm, that works, I forgot that I have VS2010 on this machine.
[2014-02-07 11:19:20] garndt: of course I never get past just opening it up
[2014-02-07 11:20:58] jimevans: i've worked pretty darn hard over the years to make sure the IE driver code is relatively easy to follow. i think i've succeeded in that, at least.
[2014-02-07 11:23:54] garndt: I'm sure that is easy to follow.  I just need to finally kick my butt into gear.
[2014-02-07 11:24:53] garndt: I need to find my ie_driver_history_lesson_from_jimevans.txt file too :)
[2014-02-07 11:25:37] andy_seit: I dread the day you quit the IE driver.  It's going to be a bloodbath.
[2014-02-07 11:26:28] garndt: not that I want Jim to stop working on it, because I heavily depend on it and think it works rather well given what he has to deal with, but maybe if it's not an option anymore I can finally convince people around here to get things working in Firefox :)
[2014-02-07 11:26:35] jimevans: nah, it won't be bad. there just won't be fixes. :)
[2014-02-07 11:26:37] lukeis: jimevans can never quit the selenium project ;)
[2014-02-07 11:27:44] jimevans: i'm cautiously optimistic that someday i won't *have* to work on it anymore, that some other (not-the-selenium-project) organization will start producing one.
[2014-02-07 11:27:49] dogarrhea_: reliable way of simulating user input?
[2014-02-07 11:27:53] andy_seit: hah
[2014-02-07 11:27:58] andy_seit: That'd be nice
[2014-02-07 11:28:19] jimevans: dogarrhea_: the IE driver in general.
[2014-02-07 11:28:38] dogarrhea_: what strategy is currently being used?
[2014-02-07 11:28:49] dogarrhea_: windows api events?
[2014-02-07 11:28:56] jimevans: dogarrhea_: there are several, depending on your capabilities that you specify.
[2014-02-07 11:29:00] dogarrhea_: interact with ie javascript engine?
[2014-02-07 11:30:09] jimevans: dogarrhea_: the default method is to use the sendmessage api. this is absolutely, completely the Wrong Thing™ to do, but it's the only so-called "native events" approach that doesn't require the IE window to be in the foreground.
[2014-02-07 11:31:13] jimevans: another method that's available is a code path that uses the windows sendinput api. this is the "right" input simulation api according to MSFT, but it *requires* the IE window to have focus. full stop. otherwise whatever window *does* have focus will get the keyboard and mouse input.
[2014-02-07 11:32:09] jimevans: another available approach is turning native events off, which uses javascript only to simulate the user input events, but that has it's own problems. like, what if we guess wrong about how the browser would fire which events in what order.
[2014-02-07 11:32:19] garndt: so the sendinput api is more reliable?  Hrm, My IE windows always have focus because of other issues that happen when they don't.  I wonder if I could use that
[2014-02-07 11:32:43] ttyp0: so you can't like pipe to specified window? seems kinda dumb but maybe I just don't know enough :)
[2014-02-07 11:32:50] jimevans: garndt: give it a shot. all you have to do is set the requireWindowFocus capability to true.
[2014-02-07 11:33:16] jimevans: ttyp0: hah. a-hahaha. hahaha! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
[2014-02-07 11:33:23] jimevans: *sob*
[2014-02-07 11:33:28] jimevans: thanks. i needed that.
[2014-02-07 11:33:33] ttyp0: aww, there there
[2014-02-07 11:33:45] jimevans: windows is really braindead when it comes to allowing you to do stuff like that.
[2014-02-07 11:34:00] jimevans: and it's windows, not IE per se, that's at fault there.
[2014-02-07 11:34:05] ttyp0: indeed :(
[2014-02-07 11:34:28] jimevans: (though to be fair, i'm not sure linux is much better, and i'm quite sure os x isn't)

[2014-02-07 11:36:08] jimevans: dogarrhea_: i've thought about trying to leverage some of the accessibility apis (either active accessibility or ui automation), but those either have limitations that i haven't been able to crack yet, or IE doesn't expose what i need to hook into it with those apis.

[2014-02-07 11:42:03] garndt: jimevans: just for my own curiosity, what is less reliable with the default input method in IE?
[2014-02-07 11:42:35] jimevans: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/30/423202.aspx
[2014-02-07 11:43:04] jimevans: it's also particularly bad with mouse movements.
[2014-02-07 11:43:08] jarib: jimevans: can't you just say that everything must be 64-bit for IE10?
[2014-02-07 11:43:12] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 747
[2014-02-07 11:43:32] jimevans: (particularly susceptible to window focus, physical mouse cursor position, etc.)
[2014-02-07 11:43:36] jimevans: jarib: nope.
[2014-02-07 11:43:41] jimevans: because it's not.
[2014-02-07 11:44:16] jarib: "if you want to test IE10, it needs to be on a 64-bit machine"?
[2014-02-07 11:44:41] jimevans: when you launch IE10, you get a 64-bit "manager" process, which owns the window displaying the browser chrome, and a 32-bit process which owns the "content" window rendering the DOM.

[2014-02-07 11:45:08] jarib: so the render process is *never* 64-bit
[2014-02-07 11:45:33] jimevans: not entirely true, but true enough for my purposes. the problem is, i need hooks into *both* processes for different reasons.
[2014-02-07 11:46:23] jimevans: (need to hook the content processes for keystrokes; need to hook the manager process for full-page screenshots)
[2014-02-07 11:46:43] jarib: but if there are ways to make both be 64-bit, it seems like a reasonable requirement
[2014-02-07 11:47:04] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-07 11:47:14] jimevans: you can't make them both 64-bit without tumbling into security restrictions that make that unworkable.
[2014-02-07 11:47:15] jarib: not ideal, but not unreasonable
[2014-02-07 11:47:23] jarib: ah, ok

[2014-02-07 15:15:01] lukeis: I feel inclined to fix the issue raised by the user, but that one line caveat in the spec makes me wonder if I should implement that too ;)
[2014-02-07 15:15:24] lukeis: we do not have any tests assuming anything related to returns and not calling callback
[2014-02-07 15:16:00] lukeis: "return true;" to execute async script should technically be valid, but that won't work in the current firefox driver

[2014-02-07 15:18:49] lukeis: AutomatedTester: so, do you agree with the spec as written, and this is a bug in FirefoxDriver? https://gist.github.com/lukeis/8873947
[2014-02-07 15:19:43] lukeis: chrome also times out :)
[2014-02-07 15:23:06] lukeis: but there's also potentially a problem… how to determine if someone 'undefined' was returned?   var result = (function(){ })();  and var result = (function(){return undefined;})();  are the same thing for 'result' and thus we wouldn't be able to tell if the user attempted to return something or we are waiting for the callback
