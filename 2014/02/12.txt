[2014-02-12 02:43:04] HowardwLo: I'm looping through a ton of user accounts on my site using selenium, each user has a unique id. I don't want to check accounts that i've already done in the past, whats the best way to record a history and check against it? I currently have a json file that is read and dumped each pass through the loop, but it seems to slow down the whole looping process.
[2014-02-12 02:43:09] HowardwLo: any advice? :)
[2014-02-12 02:44:11] barancev|2: keep it in memory
[2014-02-12 02:45:21] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-12 02:48:03] HowardwLo: could you elaborate?
[2014-02-12 02:48:39] HowardwLo: sometimes, due to my terrible coding skills, selenium fails and i have to restart it. I would like it to keep that history :O
[2014-02-12 02:49:40] barancev|2: don't dump/parse on each iteration, create a finally block or a teardowm method that is executed even after an exception and dump the results in this block only
[2014-02-12 02:50:18] HowardwLo: ohh
[2014-02-12 02:50:24] HowardwLo: i think i get what you mean
[2014-02-12 02:51:05] HowardwLo: would it be a try finally thing?
[2014-02-12 02:51:18] barancev|2: yes

[2014-02-12 02:55:36] HowardwLo: would i put the try over the while loop?
[2014-02-12 02:57:05] barancev|2: yes, load before the loop. and dump in a finally block
[2014-02-12 02:58:14] HowardwLo: https://gist.github.com/Howardwlo/8953402

[2014-02-12 14:17:35] HowardwLo: jleyba: so you just use set() on an array/list ?

[2014-02-12 14:19:37] ato: HowardwLo: A set should be significantly faster provided you don't need duplicate entries.
[2014-02-12 14:19:39] barancev|2: if I replace driver.switchTo().frame(index) with driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElements(By.tagName("iframe")).get(index)) all browsers are consistent
[2014-02-12 14:19:56] HowardwLo: ato: i check against duplicates, so a set would be perfect
[2014-02-12 14:19:57] barancev|2: so switching by index *is* ambiguous!
[2014-02-12 14:20:14] ato: HowardwLo: Using a set, you can actually remove those duplication checks altogether.
[2014-02-12 14:20:37] lukeis: barancev|2: only for dynamically generated dom's :)
[2014-02-12 14:20:47] HowardwLo: ato: how so? I'm currently using if X not in list: ...
[2014-02-12 14:20:47] lukeis: (javascript manipulated that is...)
[2014-02-12 14:21:16] lukeis: HowardwLo:  set.add("something");  set.add("something");   <-   len(set) == 1

[2014-02-12 14:21:56] lukeis: barancev|2: i'm full of them ;)
[2014-02-12 14:22:09] HowardwLo: so if x = set([1,2,3]), x.add("3"); x.add("4"); --> x = set([1,2,3,4]) ?
[2014-02-12 14:22:34] ato: HowardwLo: Exactly!
[2014-02-12 14:22:58] HowardwLo: neat. I'm guessing a dump to json would be similar to an array dump?
[2014-02-12 14:23:09] ato: A set is by mathematical definition a concept of a finite set without duplicates.
[2014-02-12 14:23:10] HowardwLo: in json it would show up as [1,2,3,4] ?
[2014-02-12 14:23:46] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-12 14:23:49] ato: list(x) would cast/convert it to a list for serialization in JSON.

[2014-02-12 14:24:02] ato: Since x is a set, it would return [1,2,3,4] as you say.
[2014-02-12 14:24:03] HowardwLo: ah ok, awesomez
[2014-02-12 14:24:09] HowardwLo: and loading the json
[2014-02-12 14:24:17] HowardwLo: i would need to set() the list
[2014-02-12 14:24:25] ato: Right.
[2014-02-12 14:24:35] ato: Which is the same thing as you do when constructing a set in Python.
[2014-02-12 14:24:50] ato: Because [1,2,3,4] is a list.
[2014-02-12 14:25:23] ato: (Roughly.  IIRC it's not exactly the truth until you store it.)
[2014-02-12 14:25:30] HowardwLo: so if I'm checking if X exists in a set, would it be the same if statement as a list?
[2014-02-12 14:25:48] HowardwLo: if X not in set:
[2014-02-12 14:25:52] ato: Yes.

[2014-02-12 15:39:04] barancev|2: and my point is: this is a good justification to deprecate swithTo().frame by index
[2014-02-12 15:39:34] barancev|2: because it is not consistent among browsers
