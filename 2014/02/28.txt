[2014-02-28 01:57:18] Anton___: Can any of you guys tell me how I can do roll ups in java or how i can include / get my java testcase to use my javascript rollups? totaly confused no one seems to know the answer to this question, the rc server wont run testcase that include rollups?? i think its because java is missing the rollup file (the .js file that i set the in the options of the IDE) PLEASE HELP!
[2014-02-28 02:00:26] *dimacus looks up what a rollup is'
[2014-02-28 02:01:37] dimacus: Anton___: what are you trying to accomplish?

[2014-02-28 02:04:12] Anton___: Hi Dimacus, I am trying to run my testcase, which i am running from the Eclipse IDE, to run on the selenium server, it runs as long as i don't have any selenium.rollup("rollupname",""); steps in my script
[2014-02-28 02:05:03] Anton___: as soon as i put in a rollup step into my testcase it just gets so far (the the point where the rollup is executed) and then falls over
[2014-02-28 02:05:06] dimacus: i guess i'm not familiar with "rollup" is that a jQuery roll up?
[2014-02-28 02:06:52] dimacus: i'm gonna catch up on that and i think i might be able to help you after that
[2014-02-28 02:07:44] Anton___: a roll up is what u use to specify repeatable action, i.e. a login action, its written in javascript, I don't know if you use the selenium IDE but in there u specify a javascript file in the options section under selenium core extentions
[2014-02-28 02:08:31] Tuplario, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-28 02:09:06] Anton___: here is what the file looks like
[2014-02-28 02:09:07] dimacus: yeah just saw the tutorialâ€¦ that's interesting, what version of the IDE, so here is the thing about roll ups
[2014-02-28 02:09:08] Anton___: http://pastebin.com/HpniSVqB
[2014-02-28 02:09:38] dimacus: are you trying to write your test in Java now, that is converting IDE to Java?
[2014-02-28 02:10:57] Anton___: maybe there is an easier way of doing a roll up, basically i look at the rollup as being a way to include repetable steps of a test, so for example, loggin in could be a rollup so insted of me recording login or hand coding it i would just include the rollup, yea IDE to Java
[2014-02-28 02:11:28] dimacus: yeah just forget about the roll ups :)
[2014-02-28 02:11:38] dimacus: here let me give you an example java code, one sec
[2014-02-28 02:11:45] Anton___: thanks
[2014-02-28 02:11:56] pons, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-28 02:12:08] dimacus: basically a roll up in the IDE is a way to make the IDE almost like a real language
[2014-02-28 02:12:21] dimacus: it's trying to solve a problem that does not actually exist in java
[2014-02-28 02:12:39] dimacus: Anton___: are you using Selenium 1 or Selenium 2 in Java?
[2014-02-28 02:12:58] Anton___: selenium 2
[2014-02-28 02:12:59] dimacus: (IDE is Selenium 1 and you should probably upgrade to Selenium 2/Webdriver)
[2014-02-28 02:13:03] Anton___: ah i see what u mean
[2014-02-28 02:13:07] dimacus: ok cool, let me look up htat syntax
[2014-02-28 02:13:12] Anton___: so instead of a rollup, use a for loop? lol
[2014-02-28 02:13:21] Anton___: or some form of loop and an array and a counter?
[2014-02-28 02:13:24] Anton___: or a function
[2014-02-28 02:14:23] dimacus: not a loop per se, but yeah a function/method
[2014-02-28 02:14:40] dimacus: basically you want to setup your project in this way:
[2014-02-28 02:14:44] Anton___: ahh i see what u mean, so instead of selenium.rollup();
[2014-02-28 02:14:49] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2014-02-28 02:14:50] Anton___: myfunction();
[2014-02-28 02:15:21] Anton___: that contins the selenium functions for loggin in etc
[2014-02-28 02:16:51] dimacus: Anton___: https://gist.github.com/dima-groupon/9268624
[2014-02-28 02:17:01] dimacus: that's the rough start
[2014-02-28 02:17:30] dimacus: if you want to get more advanced, you should go to a page object model, where the test makes calls like this:
[2014-02-28 02:17:34] mithran, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-28 02:17:43] dimacus: RegistrationPage.filloutForm();

[2014-02-28 02:17:46] mithran, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-02-28 02:17:52] mithran, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-28 02:18:07] dimacus: this way you are re-using the same code and your test code is defined in 1 place and 1 place only
[2014-02-28 02:18:44] dimacus: Anton___:  here are a couple of Page Object tutorials in java http://luizfar.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/page-objects/
[2014-02-28 02:18:56] dimacus: http://www.wakaleo.com/blog/279-selenium-2web-driver-the-land-where-page-objects-are-king
[2014-02-28 02:19:14] mithran: hi all, im trying to load a html page that resides locally on my mac machine, the command driver.get('/Users/test/a.html') does not seem to work, can someone please point me in the right direction?
[2014-02-28 02:20:16] dimacus: mithran: what language are you using?
[2014-02-28 02:23:11] WhereIsMySpoon, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-28 02:24:08] dimacus: mithran: this works just fine for me in ruby with firefox
[2014-02-28 02:24:09] dimacus: driver.navigate.to("/Users/dima/Desktop/home.html")
[2014-02-28 02:24:14] Anton___: thanks dimacus ill take a look at them, just out of curiosity, if you had to test a website, what process would you take? currently the way i view is, i would record my steps in the IDE, export then to java, and then push the java to the rc server so i can run it on multiple browsers is that what you would do? or is there a quicker approach
[2014-02-28 02:25:40] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton___: if you have a lot of clicks to make, that is probably the quickest approach, but you will need to manually add waits etc after you export to java
[2014-02-28 02:25:55] dimacus: Anton___: IDE is the training wheels on a bicicleâ€¦ once you write the tests in java long enough you will never use IDE again, you just write it straight in java. But basically my aproach would be to have 2 things
[2014-02-28 02:26:12] dimacus: Anton___: 1) the test itself and 2) the actual work of the tests
[2014-02-28 02:26:27] WhereIsMySpoon: dimacus: the ide saves you from writing "driver.findElement(By.id("blah")).click()"...lots of times
[2014-02-28 02:26:30] WhereIsMySpoon: if you export it
[2014-02-28 02:26:37] WhereIsMySpoon: but tbh it doesnt make tha tmuch difference
[2014-02-28 02:27:01] WhereIsMySpoon: especially seen as sometimes the ide will get the By wrong and use xpath a lot
[2014-02-28 02:27:06] dimacus: yeah trueâ€¦ but again training wheels, once you got a decent page object framework you never use ide again
[2014-02-28 02:27:07] WhereIsMySpoon: which is not very reliable

[2014-02-28 02:28:06] anubhav: hi to all
[2014-02-28 02:28:31] anubhav: can anyone have codes for hybrid framework
[2014-02-28 02:28:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton___: I will modify my statement then - use the ide to export to java to get a feel of what you will need to do roughly for the first few times, as dimacus said, like training wheels. Then you should probably not use it and start from java each time
[2014-02-28 02:28:53] WhereIsMySpoon: anubhav: please elaborate: what hybrid framework, what codes, what do you mean by "Hybrid framework"
[2014-02-28 02:28:54] dimacus: Anton___: bingo

[2014-02-28 02:38:09] anubhav: i dont know that much of java , so i need codes for frmawor, so that i can put in eclipse and start doing automation
[2014-02-28 02:38:35] WhereIsMySpoon: anubhav: so what you're really asking is "please can someone write me some java tests and do all the coding so that I can use them"?

[2014-02-28 02:40:42] anubhav: see, at starting leveal no one knows to devlop framework , so it takes time , bt if already a framework is devloped then we can go on for automation
[2014-02-28 02:41:07] WhereIsMySpoon: anubhav: I don't think you understand what "framework" means
[2014-02-28 02:41:45] WhereIsMySpoon: anubhav: selenium itself provides a framework from which to develop automated tests
[2014-02-28 02:41:55] WhereIsMySpoon: anubhav: what *you* need to do is code those tests, which is a project
[2014-02-28 02:42:16] WhereIsMySpoon: we can help you do that if you have specific problems, but we are not going to write your tests for you
[2014-02-28 02:42:32] WhereIsMySpoon: that isn't what programming in general is about, nor will it help you get better at programming

You should use WebDriver.WaitUntil() instead.  That way you can stop early if the condition is met before 3sec (or whatever timeout you choose)

[2014-02-28 07:24:33] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-02-28 07:24:44] Anton___: the reason i exported it as remote contol is that is is runnin on rc server?
[2014-02-28 07:24:46] WhereIsMySpoon: replace "myWebDriver" with whatever the name of that object is
[2014-02-28 07:24:52] Anton___: ah i see

[2014-02-28 07:24:55] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-02-28 07:24:59] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know anyhting about rc
[2014-02-28 07:25:47] Anton___: is rc the only way i can run my tests on multiple browsers?
[2014-02-28 07:25:53] Anton___: or can webdriver do this too?
[2014-02-28 07:26:12] Dave_B_: webdriver can do this
[2014-02-28 07:26:38] Anton___:     driver = new FirefoxDriver();
[2014-02-28 07:26:46] Anton___: i take it i would just change that line?
[2014-02-28 07:26:52] Anton___: to the corosponding browser?
[2014-02-28 07:27:06] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton___: yep
[2014-02-28 07:27:13] Anton___: so for opera,     driver = new OperaDriver();
[2014-02-28 07:27:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton___: if your java doesnt know where the driver is located it will complain
[2014-02-28 07:27:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton___: you can do System.setProperty("webdriver.opera.driver", "/pathj/to/driver")
[2014-02-28 07:27:56] Anton___: ah cool
[2014-02-28 07:28:00] WhereIsMySpoon: or pass it in as an argument when you run it
[2014-02-28 07:28:02] WhereIsMySpoon: either works
[2014-02-28 07:28:03] Dave_B_: for some browsers you'll need to download a separate driver e.g. IEDriver and ChromeDriver
[2014-02-28 07:28:22] Anton___: i take it i would also need to download the driver from the drivers section on selenium hq site?
[2014-02-28 07:28:25] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2014-02-28 07:28:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-02-28 07:28:33] Anton___: ah i see
[2014-02-28 07:28:51] Anton___: all this time i thought all i could use was the rc server
[2014-02-28 07:28:58] Anton___: are the drivers constantly being updated?

[2014-02-28 08:50:51] rorycb: I will ping you both sometime in the next week then :)
[2014-02-28 08:50:55] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: an implementation of what
[2014-02-28 08:51:00] rorycb: and I saw that. Amazing news

[2014-02-28 08:52:12] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: the goal of the project is to only retain the client implemntations and push the browser bits to browser vendors
[2014-02-28 08:52:26] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: like my employer, Google, MS, Blackberry
[2014-02-28 08:52:45] wilhelm: Which is why we're doing a spec. (c:
[2014-02-28 08:52:48] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: hm...lots of people are still using IE8 and will probably be using IE9 and 10 for a while though
[2014-02-28 08:53:00] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: so that part will be maintained by the project
[2014-02-28 08:53:19] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-02-28 08:53:20] AutomatedTester: but we dont support IE11 now because MS changed something and we cant reverse engineer a fix
[2014-02-28 08:53:35] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-02-28 08:53:40] AutomatedTester: so when they do things like that, they need to fix it
[2014-02-28 08:53:43] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-02-28 08:53:47] WhereIsMySpoon: fair enough
[2014-02-28 08:53:54] WhereIsMySpoon: i wouldnt like to look at the IE code...

[2014-02-28 08:54:08] rorycb: AutomatedTester, I didn't realize that was why IE11 wasn't supported. interesting.
[2014-02-28 08:54:22] AutomatedTester: browser vendors know a lot about their browsers (who wudda thunk it) so it makes sense for them to work on the project
[2014-02-28 08:54:29] WhereIsMySpoon: :D yea
[2014-02-28 08:54:40] AutomatedTester: rorycb: it works for simple cases it might work
[2014-02-28 08:54:53] AutomatedTester: but we have seen crashes and failing tests
[2014-02-28 08:55:03] AutomatedTester: and we dont know why
[2014-02-28 08:55:09] AutomatedTester: by we I mean Jim Evans
[2014-02-28 08:55:19] WhereIsMySpoon: is jim welsh?
[2014-02-28 08:55:36] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: no, but with a name like that he should be
[2014-02-28 08:55:42] AutomatedTester: he is 'merican
[2014-02-28 08:55:46] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: thats what I was thinking

[2014-02-28 08:58:17] rorycb: haha true, tried taking public transit in Florida only onceâ€¦ was not fun.

[2014-02-28 15:29:43] dogarrhea_: basically, an animation occurs where an element is continually resized due to some poostrap (bootstrap) animation.

[2014-02-28 15:43:58] dogarrhea_: of course, anyone script can do settimeout(function(){shit on the css}, 30000); or whatever it is
[2014-02-28 15:44:53] lukeis: in jquery there's a global variable to watch to see if anything is pendingâ€¦ (but no, can't avoid that sort of shitty timeout)
[2014-02-28 15:46:13] lukeis: my typically approach is to kill shitty things like that :) (once had to deal with a site that had the 'Forsee' thing on itâ€¦ yeah, first thing I had the automation do one any page was kill that javascript)

[2014-02-28 15:56:32] dogarrhea_:  protected WebDriverWait getWait(long timeOutInSeconds) {         new WebDriverWait(driver, timeOutInSeconds)     } we use this
[2014-02-28 15:56:51] dogarrhea_: passing in 10 seconds or 60 seconds. this also seems to fail to find certain elements when they actually appear

[2014-02-28 15:58:03] lukeis: the timeout can happen either because your condition is wrong or that it really did take too long
[2014-02-28 15:58:06] dogarrhea_: we also tried this to no avail (c is a function that attempts to find/click/etc)
