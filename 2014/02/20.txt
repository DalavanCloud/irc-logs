[2014-02-20 05:39:00] stan__, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-02-20 05:39:36] ato: ttyp0: .docx is a proprietary format that I can't read unless I buy a copy of Microsoft Windows.
[2014-02-20 05:39:40] ato: s/Windows/Office/
[2014-02-20 05:40:04] ttyp0: .docx can be opened with openoffice/libreoffice (not 100% sure about the latter) even if the formatting won't be 100%
[2014-02-20 05:40:08] SunilJoshi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 05:40:33] ato: Does that make it any less proprietary or more open?
[2014-02-20 05:40:44] ttyp0: no, it makes the content accessible.
[2014-02-20 05:40:53] ttyp0: which, based on your complaint, was the main issue :)
[2014-02-20 05:41:03] ttyp0: kinda gives me the feeling that's not the main issue at all! :)
[2014-02-20 05:42:36] ato: My main issue with OOXML isn't that I can't find programs written by clever people in the free software community that can read them, but that it's a silly format to use if you care about open standards.
[2014-02-20 05:42:38] ato: Microsoft used bully tactics to push the OOXML standard through the ISO certification committee.  I was outside the meeting protesting against it.

[2014-02-20 05:46:21] ttyp0: I'm all for "attitude problems", having some serious ones myself (mainly towards pseudo-authorities) but I'm also pro-moderation i.e. I dislike all fanaticism, to a degree :)
[2014-02-20 05:47:41] ttyp0: no need for don quijotism though, let the windmills be meaning, in this case, that I usually steer clear of e.g. the windows vs linux battles as they are almost always both pointless and fruitless
[2014-02-20 05:48:04] SamuraiJack, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 05:48:47] ttyp0: what I'm trying to say here is that I was merely curious as to why .docx is reason enough to not even look, but you answered that question and I've no incentive (or interest) to try and dig deeper ;)
[2014-02-20 05:49:48] Dave_B_: yeah, doesn't make the candidate bad, jsut the recruiters
[2014-02-20 05:50:12] Dave_B_: even if you've a burning hatred for the format it doesn't make the content worthless
[2014-02-20 05:50:36] Dave_B_: or, perhaps it's the reverse and it's jobs…. again, same logic
[2014-02-20 05:50:59] Dave_B_: I think everyone hates recruiters, that's no news ;)

[2014-02-20 10:10:19] dimacus: or are you not able to send keys to it?
[2014-02-20 10:10:40] Abhay_: It doesn't throw any exceptions, so I am guessing it finds it perfectly fine. It just doesn't seem to send the text to the write text box.
[2014-02-20 10:10:56] Abhay_: *right
[2014-02-20 10:11:19] dimacus: i don't see a text box inside of that div, is it loaded later with ajax?

[2014-02-20 10:20:32] dimacus: ok so basiclaly what you need to do is use CSS selector or xpath to get inside of the text box
[2014-02-20 10:20:46] dimacus: as in, right now you are sending the "type" command to the div and not the text box
[2014-02-20 10:21:09] dimacus: not sure why it worked before, but now it does not, and that is actually designed behavior
[2014-02-20 10:21:21] dimacus: Abhay_: what language binding is this? .NET?

[2014-02-20 10:24:50] dimacus: Abhay_: i don't have the exact code for you but it would look something like this in .NET :
[2014-02-20 10:25:19] dimacus: driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#BodyContentPlaceHolder_HtmlEditorExtender_ExtenderContentEditable textarea")).SendKeys("foo");

[2014-02-20 11:31:32] dimacus: dogarrhea: the way i've done it before is you take the whole pool of tests you got, devide them into X many chunks, set up X many DBs/test environments, run each chunk sequentially, run all chunks in parallel
[2014-02-20 11:32:33] dogarrhea: one of the end to end tests is difficult to split up.
[2014-02-20 11:33:01] dogarrhea: for example, opening a document. modifying the document, saving the document. reopening the document to see if your content is fine.
[2014-02-20 11:33:41] dogarrhea: "run all chunks in parallel" seems difficult to run for this
[2014-02-20 11:35:01] dogarrhea: I'm going to push for "separate databases"
[2014-02-20 11:36:16] dogarrhea: now, for another hairy problem.  We started out with firefox only tests
[2014-02-20 11:36:56] dogarrhea: Now we are trying to port this test to IE but only half the tests pass.  Not because IE functionality isn't working (page title should be present and have a certain value).  But because the driver works different for firefox and IE
[2014-02-20 11:37:04] dogarrhea: both IE and Firefox are displaying titlesl
[2014-02-20 11:37:15] dimacus: sorry mate :(
[2014-02-20 11:37:25] dogarrhea: Ie driver just doesn't find the title on IE

[2014-02-20 11:38:28] selbot2_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/entry
[2014-02-20 11:41:25] dogarrhea: Also, we are experiencing different functionality for hover events in IE vs Firefox, a known issue, but part of our testing nonetheless
[2014-02-20 11:42:18] dogarrhea: the mouse hovers over something, links appear, we click those links.  This doesn't work in IE.  Porting to IE is going to be painful.  Right now we are having a copy of our Firefox code, with the parts that don't work in IE commented out. Then we run this separately from the Firefox tests.
[2014-02-20 11:42:36] selbot2_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-02-20 11:42:44] dogarrhea: Of course, this is unscalable and uselesss in the long run. Any code we modify in either file needs to be replicated in both copies.
[2014-02-20 11:42:47] selbot2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 11:43:01] dogarrhea: but for now, we have some coverage on IE.
[2014-02-20 11:43:16] jimevans: the IE driver sucks at simulating user input.
[2014-02-20 11:43:30] jimevans: (just sayin')
[2014-02-20 11:44:00] barancev: jimevans: is 2.40 uploaded somewhere?
[2014-02-20 11:44:05] jimevans: nope.
[2014-02-20 11:44:08] jimevans: at least not yet.
[2014-02-20 11:44:24] jimevans: i have the binary artifacts ready to be uploaded, but nowhere to put them yet.
[2014-02-20 11:44:48] barancev: ok. I was going to update the site. too early.
[2014-02-20 11:45:24] barancev: lukeis: ^^^ is there a decision?
[2014-02-20 11:45:34] lukeis: dogarrhea: regarding the issue with multiple tests accessing the same exact data source at the same time, you could put a lock around the data source to allow only one access it
[2014-02-20 11:45:41] lukeis: barancev: nope
[2014-02-20 11:46:07] dogarrhea: from the front end point of view, that's new functionality that has to be written
[2014-02-20 11:46:16] dogarrhea: "this resource is locked" status messages etc.

[2014-02-20 11:46:20] lukeis: simon was talking with jleyba (who is attempting to get us access to google storage) waiting on word from that
[2014-02-20 11:46:57] dimacus: dogarrhea: another option is for you to spin off the tests which need to hit 1 data source into a seperate suite that runs 1 test at the time… it's quite literarly least involved way to go

[2014-02-20 11:48:06] dogarrhea: how does that work?
[2014-02-20 11:48:25] dogarrhea: I can isolate the one part that modifies data to clicking something.
[2014-02-20 11:48:38] dimacus: dogarrhea: are you asking me or lukeis?
[2014-02-20 11:48:47] dogarrhea: for the parallel stuff.
[2014-02-20 11:49:06] dogarrhea: As far as I'm concerned, sauce/selenium offer no mutex/pthread or other synchronization support whatsoever.
[2014-02-20 11:49:24] dimacus: i think you are right on that
[2014-02-20 11:49:45] omaciel, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 11:49:47] dogarrhea: i can clearly identify the critical code that modifies data.
[2014-02-20 11:49:54] omaciel: hi, I have tried to use phantomjs + webdriver (python) to connect to a https server and I can't seem to connect to it... there are no errors either... I suspect that it may be ssl cert related but can't tell for sure. Has anyone here seen something similar?
[2014-02-20 11:49:57] dogarrhea: normally, i'd wrap that in some mutex synchronized code
[2014-02-20 11:50:47] dogarrhea: but the way jenkins and others are integrated with selenium, this doesn't work.
[2014-02-20 11:50:48] dimacus: dogarrhea: yeah… seperate DBs is probably the sanest long term solution for you

[2014-02-20 11:52:48] dogarrhea: it's not hard to implement your own threading?
[2014-02-20 11:53:03] jarib: if your tests are running off a single machine, it could just be a wrapper around a file lock
[2014-02-20 11:53:16] jarib: you're not implemetning threading
[2014-02-20 11:53:27] dogarrhea: this is essentially the same problem
[2014-02-20 11:53:41] dogarrhea: if I have to implement a mutex
[2014-02-20 11:53:51] dogarrhea: I am implementing multithreading support. i'm not going to do that.
[2014-02-20 11:54:13] dogarrhea: That's not what business wants me to do. and I'm fine with that
[2014-02-20 11:55:00] jarib: ok :)
[2014-02-20 11:55:09] dogarrhea: If you have read Djikstra's paper,
[2014-02-20 11:55:26] dogarrhea: you would understand that "it's not very hard to implement a simple lock service" is not true.

[2014-02-20 12:49:03] dogarrhea: but as far as efficiency of tests go, not waiting for ie8 to finish, then ie9, then firefox, then chrome, without random failures, I'll probably just say "separate databases or nothing"

[2014-02-20 13:11:59] lbod: hi, this is a very random question and am only asking as im interested.. I've been using selenium/webdriver for yrs but much more recently and ive seen that wd drivers can have compatibility issues with the latest browsers e.g. saucelabs default to chrome 27 for the chrome webdriver.. out of interest, what causes these incompatabilities and what breaks the drivers when new browsers are released?
[2014-02-20 13:12:39] dude-x: changes to the javascript API pretty much
[2014-02-20 13:12:43] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 746
[2014-02-20 13:12:45] jimevans: lbod: depends on the browser, actually
[2014-02-20 13:13:00] lbod: so what type of api changes?
[2014-02-20 13:13:16] Guest65703, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 13:13:54] lbod: are we talking ECMA JS changes?
[2014-02-20 13:14:05] Emil_tester, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-20 13:14:25] jimevans: with firefox, for example, there are binary components for native events written in c++ that require a version of the gecko sdk to compile against, and this changes from version to version. this is why there's a lag between a firefox release and a version of webdriver that supports it.
[2014-02-20 13:14:36] Emil_tester: can anyone help with right mouse click problem?

[2014-02-20 13:15:09] jimevans: Emil_tester: looks like you're probably doing everything correctly at first glance.
[2014-02-20 13:15:30] Emil_tester: it stop working recently ... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9123143

[2014-02-20 13:16:02] barancev: oops, sorry for duplication :)
[2014-02-20 13:16:03] jimevans: but i can't see your site, so i don't know what voodoo the javascript widget that supplies the context menu is doing.

[2014-02-20 13:17:04] jimevans: also, i've not seen you say whether the context menu appears and can't find the menu item, or if the context menu isn't appearing at all.
[2014-02-20 13:17:04] phasze: Emil_tester: did your xpath to that item change recently?
[2014-02-20 13:17:04] Emil_tester: phasze: yes
[2014-02-20 13:17:04] lbod: jimevans, thx, that's the type of change id expect would break.. how common is it and how do the devs keep on top of it? seeing as WD is now a W3C standard id hope vendors would do all they can to make sure things dont break
[2014-02-20 13:17:16] jimevans: well, let's be clear. it's not a standard yet.
[2014-02-20 13:17:22] lbod: still dev but will be
[2014-02-20 13:17:31] jimevans: we're working on it, but it's not there yet.
[2014-02-20 13:18:13] jimevans: also, not every vendor has bought into building their own driver yet.
[2014-02-20 13:19:02] lbod: like google?
[2014-02-20 13:19:02] jimevans: (i'm looking at you, apple and microsoft)
[2014-02-20 13:19:02] lbod: haha, i still bkame google
[2014-02-20 13:19:03] phasze: mmmm, having an official IE driver from microsoft....
[2014-02-20 13:19:03] jimevans: lbod: the chrome driver is supplied by the chromium team.

[2014-02-20 13:19:22] jimevans: and webdriver tests are part of the build process for chromium and chrome.
[2014-02-20 13:19:24] lbod: its the one ive always had the most issues with, anyhow, at the back of my mind it worries me OS projects are relying so much on something that still seems unstable.. the most important issue for OS projects is testing the latest browsers
[2014-02-20 13:20:50] jnick: what are some common reasons webdriver would throw false negatives?
[2014-02-20 13:20:51] lbod: is it mostly binaries that cause the problems? Someone said earlier APIs, i thought they were talking ecma
[2014-02-20 13:20:53] jimevans: lbod: i'll also point out that the chromedriver is the one most proactive about supporting yet-to-be-released versions. each chromedriver release supports current and previous stable channel, beta channel, and dev channel.
[2014-02-20 13:21:15] lbod: sorry, didnt mean to offend, it was the driver i used to always have issues with till the last 2 yrs..

[2014-02-20 14:55:31] ato: jimevans is landing thirty or so minutes before that.
[2014-02-20 14:55:51] AutomatedTester: I shouldnt be so pessimistic about how bad SFO customs is...
[2014-02-20 14:55:59] ato: Do you find it bad?
[2014-02-20 14:56:07] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-02-20 14:56:08] jimevans: yes, i arrive at 1845 sunday.
[2014-02-20 14:56:25] lukeis: it really depends on how many other international flights landed at the same time
[2014-02-20 14:56:26] AutomatedTester: I regularly wait 2+ hrs at SFO to clear customs and immigration
[2014-02-20 14:56:36] ato: AutomatedTester: Wow.  I've never had that coming to US.
[2014-02-20 14:56:37] lukeis: you should fly into oakland ;)

[2014-02-20 14:57:02] jimevans: one advantage of flying domestically, i suppose
[2014-02-20 14:57:03] wilhelm: Sunday.
[2014-02-20 14:57:07] ato: The worst line I've had was leaving Canada from Toronto, where they insisted I go in the U.S. nationals line.

[2014-02-20 14:57:49] AutomatedTester: Canada -> US has a special system to clear customs in Canada which is slightly better
[2014-02-20 14:58:08] ato: I say that, but actually India is a lot worse…
[2014-02-20 14:58:27] AutomatedTester: GTAC last year I had 3hrs to clear customs at EWR
[2014-02-20 14:58:44] ato: That's insane!
[2014-02-20 14:59:07] AutomatedTester: compared to my 15 minutes from foot off plane to other side of customs in LHR
[2014-02-20 14:59:08] ato: I went straight through in less than 20 mins I think.
[2014-02-20 14:59:11] ato: I also went from EWR.
[2014-02-20 14:59:37] ato: LHR is lovely.
[2014-02-20 15:00:30] lukeis: funny enough my family used to plan our international flights to go in / out of SFO rather than LAX because it was so much easier to get through customs in SFO :)
[2014-02-20 15:00:51] wilhelm: Eugh, this reminds me. How long does the visa waiver thing last?

[2014-02-20 15:03:50] wilhelm: May next year.
[2014-02-20 15:04:23] wilhelm: I guess I should update my flight number and accomodation. Wrong coast.
[2014-02-20 15:04:32] ato: lukeis: Your country needs to stop this nonsense about stamping the passport.  I need to get a new one soon.
[2014-02-20 15:05:19] AutomatedTester: ato: but but... I like stamps

[2014-02-20 15:07:09] lukeis: hehe
[2014-02-20 15:07:29] AutomatedTester: wilhelm: what do you mean _were_ its more like _is_
[2014-02-20 15:07:32] lukeis: custom agents love fucking with foreigners ;)
[2014-02-20 15:07:35] AutomatedTester: or _are_

[2014-02-20 15:08:02] dogarrhea: jarib, it really depends on how many shared resources there are.
[2014-02-20 15:08:10] wilhelm: AutomatedTester: Good point. He started grooming after we bullied him into getting a proper job, though.

[2014-02-20 15:10:30] jarib: lukeis: you're right about being bureaucratic - a norwegian friend of mine waited on line for 2 hours to hand in the papers to get a social security number, only to be turned down because he didn't bring the second page of the form.
[2014-02-20 15:10:40] jarib: the second page only had instructions for how to fill out the first
[2014-02-20 15:10:48] jarib: no fields

[2014-02-20 15:11:22] wilhelm: jarib: Almost on par with our own homeland!
[2014-02-20 15:11:38] ato: jarib: I forgot every piece of paperwork they sent me, and I still got my national insurance number approved.
