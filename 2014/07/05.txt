[2014-07-05 00:07:39] wlp|tab: For that matter, would someone here know where in the Firefox source the relevant code would be?  They expect to use the current stable ESR version of the Toolkit.
[2014-07-05 00:08:22] wlp|tab: Hence, if it's part of the toolkit, we don't have a problem.
[2014-07-05 00:08:50] wlp|tab: If you could tell me what to look for, that would help.  A class or interface name for instance.
[2014-07-05 00:11:04] wlp|tab: I personally have troubles believing the code would be inside the toolkit as only browsers need it.  Something like an e-mail client or music player would have no use for it.
[2014-07-05 00:11:53] wlp|tab: barancev: Not sure if you would know any of that.

[2014-07-05 12:07:30] pauldespre: I want to click on a "next page" in a while and break from while when the click fails (the last page was loaded and there no "next page" button anymore). The problem is that the wile is looping at infinite when I use PhantomJS. With Firefox as webdriver it goes fine
[2014-07-05 12:07:39] pauldespre: What may be the problem? Here is my code: http://bpaste.net/show/7Mz47ta8pknZeQORVoK8/

[2014-07-05 13:34:53] ato: pauldespre: Presumably PhantomJS always finds the element so the while loop is never broken.
[2014-07-05 13:35:34] pauldespre: ato: I think I've solved it
[2014-07-05 13:35:56] pauldespre: I'm clicking on the <a> element from that <li>
[2014-07-05 13:36:05] pauldespre: no directly on <li> and it seems to work
[2014-07-05 13:37:53] ato: Well there you go (-:
[2014-07-05 13:38:02] ato: It would be interesting to see what Chrome or Safari does in this case.
[2014-07-05 13:40:32] pauldespre: I've tried once to use Chrome because both Firefox and PhantomJS failed, but I didn't managed to install the webdriver
[2014-07-05 13:40:56] ato: I'm only saying it because PhantomJS is using WebKit, which Chrome used to be based on.
[2014-07-05 13:41:19] ato: So it would be interesting to see if that presents with the same issue, or if it's a headless problem with PhantomJS.
[2014-07-05 13:41:50] pauldespre: cases like this are pretty annoying, to see that exactly the same piece of code is working with Firefox and it doesn't with PhantomJS :)
[2014-07-05 13:42:32] ato: You can help us pinpoint what the issue is so we can fix it (-:
[2014-07-05 13:42:41] ato: It's free software!

[2014-07-05 13:44:16] ato: I'm suspecting it's a PhantomJS issue.
[2014-07-05 13:44:41] pauldespre: probably
[2014-07-05 13:45:01] pauldespre: if you have any suggestion that may help diagnose the problem, let me know :)
