[2014-07-08 03:21:09] kabir__: provide some stuff related to selenium so that i can learn fast
[2014-07-08 03:21:23] lukeis: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp
[2014-07-08 03:21:35] lukeis: have a read :)
[2014-07-08 03:21:35] kabir__: any other link
[2014-07-08 03:21:59] lukeis: read first and then ask questions
[2014-07-08 03:22:14] kabir__: difference between selenium rc n webdriver
[2014-07-08 03:22:28] lukeis: if you're new, don't worry about or learn anything about RC

[2014-07-08 03:22:57] kabir__: is there any difference between them
[2014-07-08 03:23:16] lukeis: learn webdriver first, then learn the difference
[2014-07-08 03:23:23] lukeis: and yes, there is lots
[2014-07-08 03:23:35] kabir__: i know webdriver
[2014-07-08 03:23:44] kabir__: thats why i asked
[2014-07-08 03:23:48] lukeis: o.0
[2014-07-08 03:24:15] jimevans1: kabir__: bottom line is that they're two different apis. selenium rc is an older api, and is deprecated. don't bother learning about it.

[2014-07-08 06:39:43] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: a joke?
[2014-07-08 06:39:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought htmlunitdriver was headless
[2014-07-08 06:40:22] WhereIsMySpoon: if it isnt then sorry
[2014-07-08 06:40:33] barancev: headless, yes. I doubt it can be called "good" :)
[2014-07-08 06:40:37] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-07-08 06:40:45] dimacus: their claim is that they are the fastest
[2014-07-08 06:40:47] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry then :D
[2014-07-08 06:41:10] barancev: phantomjs is headless and closest to real browsers
[2014-07-08 06:41:12] dimacus: barancev: what do you recomend?
[2014-07-08 06:41:17] dimacus: phantomjs
[2014-07-08 06:41:25] barancev: yes
[2014-07-08 06:41:31] dimacus: what about ghost driver?
[2014-07-08 06:41:42] barancev: it is the same
[2014-07-08 06:41:56] dimacus: isn't it just a webdriver api converter to phantomjs?
[2014-07-08 06:41:58] garndt: I think there is a driver for capybara that uses phantomjs.  Poltergeist I believe
[2014-07-08 06:42:22] barancev: ghostdriver was an independent project, but now it is a part of phantomjs

[2014-07-08 06:50:42] jimevans1: WhereIsMySpoon: move away from using name. rely on window handle.
[2014-07-08 06:50:52] WhereIsMySpoon: eh?
[2014-07-08 06:51:13] WhereIsMySpoon: how can I rely on teh handle
[2014-07-08 06:51:13] WhereIsMySpoon: its auto generated
[2014-07-08 06:51:20] WhereIsMySpoon: or am I missing something

[2014-07-08 06:51:57] lukeis: know when the window appears (unless multiple appear at the same time)
[2014-07-08 06:52:20] lukeis: it's easy to track the original set of handles and identify the 'new' one
[2014-07-08 06:52:34] jimevans1: as you're doing, use a loop, switch to each one, examine the name (using javascript), and switch to the one you want.

[2014-07-08 07:09:24] lukeis: unless you plan on working on selenium itself, you shouldn't need to know anything about it

[2014-07-08 09:21:40] WhereIsMySpoon: if I have http://pastie.org/9368473 as an apply method that im sending to a fluent wait, what happens if on one pass of that the alert gets clicked but it doesnt find hte button yet, then the next pass happens?
[2014-07-08 09:21:56] WhereIsMySpoon: im ignoring nosuchalertpresentexception and nosuchelementpresentexception
[2014-07-08 09:22:23] WhereIsMySpoon: nosuchelementexception*

[2014-07-08 09:25:07] WhereIsMySpoon: will it just keep cycling through trying to accept an alert
[2014-07-08 09:25:07] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-07-08 09:25:17] WhereIsMySpoon: if so, is there a better way to do a fluent wait for an alert
[2014-07-08 09:25:34] WhereIsMySpoon: really all I want to do is accept the alert in a fluent wait, I dont really want to return an element at all
[2014-07-08 09:25:41] WhereIsMySpoon: but the apply method forces a return of a WebElement

[2014-07-08 09:28:24] Dave_B_: make apply be public void apply(WebDriver input) { ...
[2014-07-08 09:28:34] Dave_B_: or is there something special about apply?

[2014-07-08 09:30:17] Dave_B_: without context I've no idea why you can't make return type void and remove the return line - that's not to say that there isn't a reason though!

[2014-07-08 09:31:04] Dave_B_: it's also not using input, so I'd probably cut that
[2014-07-08 09:31:30] Dave_B_: unless input is meant to be driver, in which case it could be made static
[2014-07-08 09:32:14] Dave_B_: oh, you're sending this to a fluent wait, is that why you need to return something?
[2014-07-08 09:32:20] dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: java?
[2014-07-08 09:32:23] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: Wait.until expects a Function<T, F>
[2014-07-08 09:32:26] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: yes
[2014-07-08 09:32:33] WhereIsMySpoon: putting new Function<WebDriver, null> doesnt work
[2014-07-08 09:32:43] WhereIsMySpoon: I guess I could just put WebDriver, Boolean or smth
[2014-07-08 09:32:49] dude-x: you have to write an ExpectedCondition which wraps google's predicate function thingie
[2014-07-08 09:33:00] dude-x: look at the expected conditions class
[2014-07-08 09:33:03] dude-x: for the template
[2014-07-08 09:33:08] WhereIsMySpoon: ive done that before
[2014-07-08 09:33:13] WhereIsMySpoon: i know about it
[2014-07-08 09:33:17] WhereIsMySpoon: its just easier to write a fluent wait
[2014-07-08 09:33:29] dude-x: i've had no trouble using different types

[2014-07-08 15:06:24] ShadowXOR: That's why I have it not define a specific one and just say self.driver = driver I thought?
[2014-07-08 15:06:32] dude-x: that's why the base page needs an init where it will take a driver parameter
[2014-07-08 15:06:42] dude-x: the driver is defined on top
[2014-07-08 15:06:51] dude-x: that one is "fired off"
[2014-07-08 15:07:42] dude-x: basepage should just say class BasePage(object): def __init__(self, driver)
[2014-07-08 15:08:20] ShadowXOR: i think i'm following
[2014-07-08 15:08:20] dude-x: you will want to store the root domain as well in the init; self.root_url = base_url (which you import from settings)
[2014-07-08 15:09:01] ShadowXOR: so do i still need to say self.driver = driver ?
[2014-07-08 15:09:08] dude-x: yes in the init
[2014-07-08 15:09:18] wdj, quitting. (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[2014-07-08 15:09:18] dude-x: but the key part is the function itself needs to be passed a driver object
[2014-07-08 15:09:30] dude-x: --> (self, driver)
[2014-07-08 15:09:53] ShadowXOR: hold on one sec...the self.root_url = base_url
[2014-07-08 15:10:01] ShadowXOR: i'm not passing it, i'm just pulling it from settings right?
[2014-07-08 15:10:06] ShadowXOR: and why isn't it self.base_url = base_url
[2014-07-08 15:10:17] dude-x: yeah; at the top of the file you can have from settings import base_url
[2014-07-08 15:10:52] dude-x: and in the init, define the instance variable on self.base_url
[2014-07-08 15:11:05] ShadowXOR: ok so i think i got that
[2014-07-08 15:11:16] ShadowXOR: so now how would i pass the driver and initiate it, presumably from in the test?
[2014-07-08 15:11:39] dude-x: in your setup you can do that
[2014-07-08 15:13:01] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 767
[2014-07-08 15:13:32] dude-x: i am thinking that maybe you can define driver as a global on the module level before you define the test class
[2014-07-08 15:13:46] dude-x: and just instantiate your page objects with that global driver
[2014-07-08 15:14:07] ShadowXOR: sorry you kind of lost me, what's the module level?
[2014-07-08 15:14:10] dude-x: i am remember that py.test doesn't treat test classes as regular classes though
[2014-07-08 15:14:16] dude-x: module level means 'file level'
[2014-07-08 15:14:27] dude-x: or in practical terms, it's not indented
[2014-07-08 15:14:31] ShadowXOR: I'm trying to get this working in the setup but i'm clearly doing something wrong
[2014-07-08 15:14:39] ShadowXOR: I did def setup(self):
[2014-07-08 15:14:40] ShadowXOR:         self.driver = BasePage.driver(driver)
[2014-07-08 15:14:42] dude-x: what test runner are you using?
[2014-07-08 15:14:48] ShadowXOR: py.test
[2014-07-08 15:15:00] dude-x: in your setup
[2014-07-08 15:15:05] dude-x: it should be something like
[2014-07-08 15:15:50] dude-x: def setup(self): driver = webdriver.Firefox() # (let's worry about making webdriver global a later time); self.driver = driver
[2014-07-08 15:16:03] dude-x: or you can combine that with self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()
[2014-07-08 15:16:15] dude-x: (combine those two statements into one)
[2014-07-08 15:16:52] dude-x: then in the test itself: login_page = LoginPage(self.driver)
[2014-07-08 15:17:21] dude-x: this MAY work but i don't know because py.test treats class objects a little bit differently
[2014-07-08 15:17:33] ShadowXOR: i guess i'm not following what that does for me
[2014-07-08 15:18:01] diminoten, quitting. (Changing host)
[2014-07-08 15:18:01] diminoten, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-08 15:18:26] dude-x: it separates the driver (which you don't care which is running) from the code that runs the test
[2014-07-08 15:18:44] dude-x: you want to be able to change drivers
[2014-07-08 15:19:12] ShadowXOR: i feel like an idiot...this is all so confusing.  i'll play with it some and see if i can get it to work
[2014-07-08 15:19:40] dude-x: it's okay
[2014-07-08 15:20:04] dude-x: if you do what I say, it will click in... eventually
[2014-07-08 15:20:24] ShadowXOR: what do you do for a living
[2014-07-08 15:20:25] dude-x: also you need a go_to, or navigate function
[2014-07-08 15:20:38] dude-x: i do, QA Automation
[2014-07-08 15:21:01] ShadowXOR: i created one a while ago in my basepage but was told not to mix my basepage classes with my tests
[2014-07-08 15:21:15] dude-x: only page objects use basepage
[2014-07-08 15:21:25] dude-x: that's the only time you use the BasePage class
[2014-07-08 15:22:12] dude-x: the only valid use of base page is this: class LoginPage(BasePage); class HomePage(BasePage); class Dashboard(BasePage), class ResetPasswordPage(BasePage)
[2014-07-08 15:22:37] dude-x: does that make sense?
[2014-07-08 15:22:51] ShadowXOR: yeah, but where do i put the generic navigate function then?
[2014-07-08 15:23:00] dude-x: generic navigate is not generic
[2014-07-08 15:23:29] dude-x: well i guess you can make it generic, but let's not get too cute; every page object should have it's own navigation function
[2014-07-08 15:23:39] dude-x: self.base_url is in BasePage
[2014-07-08 15:23:58] ShadowXOR: if it's not generic seems like it would be redundant reprogram a navigate function constantly?
[2014-07-08 15:24:12] intchanter-work, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-08 15:24:13] ShadowXOR: isn't it just like navigate_to(sample.com) and i just pass whatever URL i want?
[2014-07-08 15:24:26] ShadowXOR: or you're saying navigate to the page object that i'm editing code for so it's hard coded to always go there
[2014-07-08 15:24:28] dude-x: so your go to function can look like this: def go_to(self): self.driver.get(urljoin(self.base_url, '/home'))
[2014-07-08 15:24:48] dude-x: yeah it's "hard coded" for that page
[2014-07-08 15:25:12] ShadowXOR: one step forward two steps back ward :O
[2014-07-08 15:25:29] dude-x: this code makes it easy to change the base url
[2014-07-08 15:25:35] dude-x: some companies have multiple QA servers
[2014-07-08 15:25:55] dude-x: so you want to seprate the base domain name from the stuff that goes after
[2014-07-08 15:26:14] ShadowXOR: yeah, we have a few different ones
[2014-07-08 15:26:15] dude-x: you should be able to test on any server
[2014-07-08 15:26:27] dude-x: so this is how you make the code flexible to handle any URL
[2014-07-08 15:27:02] ShadowXOR: i guess my problem is i like truly understanding what's going on and some of this code i find hard to follow particularly in how it relates to other files. it's a tangled web
[2014-07-08 15:27:20] dude-x: did you learn about inheritance in general?
[2014-07-08 15:27:25] ShadowXOR: yes
[2014-07-08 15:27:36] ShadowXOR: but it's still pretty fresh
[2014-07-08 15:27:39] dude-x: basepage lets derived classes know all the common functions
[2014-07-08 15:27:47] ShadowXOR: but i've learned it before, i've had a few false starts, this is the farthest ive made it
[2014-07-08 15:27:54] ShadowXOR: yeah, right now my base_page just has init
[2014-07-08 15:27:56] ShadowXOR: nothing else
[2014-07-08 15:27:58] dude-x: right
[2014-07-08 15:28:03] dude-x: but in the future it will have more functions
[2014-07-08 15:28:10] dude-x: that all page objects should have
[2014-07-08 15:29:53] dude-x: the parent class defines functions and attributes that inherited classes will be able to use (if they don't override it)
[2014-07-08 15:30:15] ShadowXOR: so should i be passing the driver from the test to base_page?
[2014-07-08 15:30:36] ShadowXOR: or should the global driver be held in a generic file not related to page objects
[2014-07-08 15:30:36] dude-x: no
[2014-07-08 15:30:40] dude-x: only into the page object
[2014-07-08 15:31:06] dude-x: because a page object has base page at the "top" of the inheritence tree, it will "trickle up" into that class
[2014-07-08 15:31:32] ShadowXOR: so do i need to be importing the webdriver in the test, or in the base_page, or both?
[2014-07-08 15:31:39] ShadowXOR: or neither
[2014-07-08 15:31:52] rebelagentm, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-07-08 15:31:58] dude-x: in Python terms, when you write LoginPage(self.driver); it will check if LoginPage has a __init__; it doesn't, so then it will check the class tree. BasePage has an a __init__ and it takes one parameter! so there goes that object
[2014-07-08 15:31:58] ShadowXOR: i'm trying to set it up to work with any or all drivers by being generic and im losing myself
[2014-07-08 15:32:05] smccarthy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-07-08 15:32:23] dude-x: basepage needs nothing but an init (and a few imports that are important like the base url)

[2014-07-08 15:37:24] dude-x: it looks better
[2014-07-08 15:37:34] dude-x: but you should still fix basepage
[2014-07-08 15:37:45] ShadowXOR: and create a go to function
[2014-07-08 15:37:46] ShadowXOR: ?
[2014-07-08 15:37:48] dude-x: yeah
[2014-07-08 15:37:50] dude-x: in loginpage
[2014-07-08 15:38:03] ShadowXOR: ok thanks again man.  will work on it and should have some major updates to it hopefully by tomorrow
[2014-07-08 15:38:24] dude-x: you can create a 'go_to' function in base_page, but then you will have to understand python's inheritance to make it work
[2014-07-08 15:38:33] ShadowXOR: sounds like a good lesson to learn
[2014-07-08 15:38:49] dude-x: i have done some clever stuff like this in parent classes; but it feels a bit weird to me
[2014-07-08 15:39:02] dude-x: but it's something that my manager wanted me to do
[2014-07-08 15:39:03] dude-x: so i did it
[2014-07-08 15:39:31] ShadowXOR: yeah, i work for a small company, fell into qa 3-4 years ago.  we had a sole tester, now there's 4 of us.  i manage a small team of 2 and we recently got a more experienced guy above me
[2014-07-08 15:39:37] ShadowXOR: but they're using a UI automation tool ranorex
[2014-07-08 15:39:40] ShadowXOR: and i want something less brittle
[2014-07-08 15:39:58] ShadowXOR: i've been here a long time so i'm kind of writing my own ticket, but we'll see if they're onboard when i want to implement it, trying to get this proof of concept up by friday
[2014-07-08 15:41:10] dude-x: selenium tests need a lot of care, but free is a pretty good value
[2014-07-08 15:41:16] dude-x: especially when you can customize stuff
[2014-07-08 15:41:46] ShadowXOR: we have zero automation right now for the most part
[2014-07-08 15:42:56] dude-x: i've been there before...

[2014-07-08 21:08:14] CeruleanSky: Hello.  Using python I'm trying to open firefox build installed in different directory at the same time my main firefox install is running.  To do so I'm trying to add the command line argument "-no-remote'.  I haven't quite figured out the proper way to do so and was wondering if I could get some help?  Here are a few of my attempts and partial results: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=euFXzt4R

[2014-07-08 23:50:53] pauldespre: I'm getting some strange results with phantomjs and selenium. I'm clicking on a "next page" button and I want to get the source page. The strange thing is that every time that I call webdriver.page_source it gives me all the previously source pages
[2014-07-08 23:51:17] pauldespre: for example, when I'm on the 3rd page, it will give me source code for 1st page, 2nd page and the 3rd page
