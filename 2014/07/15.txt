[2014-07-15 07:16:41] sonofflynn: I'm using webdriver for a ruby tool that navigates to pages, and takes screenshots.  This helps when my team has a really large number of websites we need to see and don't want to navigate to them manually
[2014-07-15 07:17:06] sonofflynn: a problem I encounter, is when trying to navigate to the pages, some websites take a long time to load, and that doesn't help us
[2014-07-15 07:17:18] root_empire, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-15 07:17:52] sonofflynn: Ideally, I'd like to give selenium a timeout of 7 seconds, and if it hits that timeout, and the page isn't completely loaded, then skip that url and mvoe on to the next (via handling an exception thrown likely)
[2014-07-15 07:18:20] sonofflynn: but it looks like .get and .navigate_to are blocking, so even if I give the timeout, it still waits for the page to load before moving on with the script
[2014-07-15 07:18:54] sonofflynn: is there any way that I can tell the webdriver object to try to navigate to a page, and if not completely done loading the page when the timeout finishes, to abandon that and move on to the next url?
[2014-07-15 07:19:08] sonofflynn: so this would obviously have to be in some sort of non-blocking call I assume
[2014-07-15 07:19:12] sonofflynn: any way to do that?

[2014-07-15 07:22:48] sonofflynn: trying again in a one off script
[2014-07-15 07:22:57] sonofflynn: in case my implementation in the "main" script of mine if wrong
[2014-07-15 07:23:34] sonofflynn: eyewitness_selenium_driver.manage.timeouts.page_load = cli_parsed.timeout
[2014-07-15 07:23:42] sonofflynn: that's basically what I'm calling
[2014-07-15 07:23:49] jimevans: sonofflynn: the page load timeout does exactly what you're looking for. you don't need to worry about threading or any such nonsense. however, you need to be aware that every browser driver may not implement or respect that timeout. i know for a fact the IE driver does, and i *think* (but am not sure) that the firefox driver does.
[2014-07-15 07:23:58] girija, quitting. (Quit: girija)
[2014-07-15 07:24:26] jimevans: it should throw a timeout exception if the page is still attempting to load after that timeout is reached.
[2014-07-15 07:24:34] sonofflynn: ok.  I'm currently running this on linux.  It's using firefox
[2014-07-15 07:24:36] sonofflynn: ok, trying again
[2014-07-15 07:24:41] sonofflynn: thanks for help both of you
[2014-07-15 07:24:52] WhereIsMySpoon: yea was gonna say, page_load seems like the ruby equivalent
[2014-07-15 07:25:01] WhereIsMySpoon: of that driver.set_page_load_timeout
[2014-07-15 07:25:06] sonofflynn: yeah, I have that in there
[2014-07-15 07:25:11] sonofflynn: but I could be calling it wrong possibly

[2014-07-15 07:37:29] sonofflynn: http://pastebin.com/DNYexpKf
[2014-07-15 07:37:31] sonofflynn: let me check
[2014-07-15 07:38:23] sonofflynn: looks to be 2.42.0
[2014-07-15 07:38:47] sonofflynn: for ruby
[2014-07-15 07:38:50] sonofflynn: So with that poc
[2014-07-15 07:38:57] sonofflynn: the timeout works perfectly on the first URL
[2014-07-15 07:39:05] sonofflynn: but the second URL, it's ignored
[2014-07-15 07:39:16] sonofflynn: and just takes as long as it needs to load
[2014-07-15 07:39:31] AutomatedTester: sonofflynn: is the browser reloaded?
[2014-07-15 07:39:34] sonofflynn: no
[2014-07-15 07:39:50] AutomatedTester: by reloaded I mean a fresh browser instance
[2014-07-15 07:40:16] sonofflynn: that poc, and my script, re-use the existing instantiated webdriver object, specifically so browsers aren't re-loaded
[2014-07-15 07:40:22] sonofflynn: or brought up a new instance of them
[2014-07-15 07:40:51] AutomatedTester: interesting, it should keep the timeout for the entire length of the session
[2014-07-15 07:40:56] sonofflynn: I would think so
[2014-07-15 07:41:02] sonofflynn: but it seems to only do it for the first URL
[2014-07-15 07:41:18] AutomatedTester: very weird
[2014-07-15 07:44:00] sonofflynn: so get this
[2014-07-15 07:44:10] sonofflynn: it actually uses the timeout, for every other request
[2014-07-15 07:44:15] sonofflynn: here's the updated POC with more URLs

[2014-07-15 07:48:09] sonofflynn: moved the timeout to both outside the function, and inside it
[2014-07-15 07:48:22] sonofflynn: if you run that, it "respects" the timeout every other URL request
[2014-07-15 07:48:34] sonofflynn: so one time it will timeout, the other, it waits until the page loads
[2014-07-15 07:48:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, was just in case there was some weird behaviour with you setting that thing every time
