[2014-07-02 09:07:20] ingshtrom: create a hierarchy of test case classes so that you can do common setup/teardown for all or a subset of your tests.
[2014-07-02 09:07:55] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2014-07-02 09:08:18] ChammyCHam: thanks, seems to be a plethora of links on page objects that pointed me in the right direction regarding structure.  i'll keep that in mind regarding the classes
[2014-07-02 09:08:20] ingshtrom: that first one is a must.  the second one is more of a recommendation.  Also, I don't know python--I am just coming at this from a general OO perspective.
[2014-07-02 09:08:45] ingshtrom: Yes, page objects help for continuous UI changes by the feature code
[2014-07-02 09:10:51] ChammyCHam: Yeah...we have constant UI changes so that's important.  I have a lot of research to do.  The barrier of entry and initial learning curve is rough
[2014-07-02 09:11:02] ChammyCHam: I'm experienced in QA, but only now getting into automation
[2014-07-02 09:11:03] dude-x: ChammyCHam: well the general structure i have is, a directory for page objects
[2014-07-02 09:11:07] dude-x: a directory fortests
[2014-07-02 09:11:30] dude-x: a directory for your test infrastructure stuff, things like setting up the browser
[2014-07-02 09:11:38] dude-x: a wrapper for the selenium library
[2014-07-02 09:12:10] ChammyCHam: dude-x: Do you use python, if so should I stick to using unittest?  I hear a lot of people talking about an additional extension called nose and i'm not sure if i need it or not
[2014-07-02 09:12:24] ato: nose is really just a test runner.
[2014-07-02 09:12:31] ChammyCHam: I want to do things as right as i can out of the gate, i know i'll make mistakes and need to refactor but don't want to waste a bunch of time either

[2014-07-02 09:14:40] ChammyCHam: interesting.  i'm not sure how it works but i like the sound of 'auto-discovery of test modules and functions,'
[2014-07-02 09:14:48] ChammyCHam: i'd have to downgrade my python install though since im on 3.4
[2014-07-02 09:14:55] ChammyCHam: and looks like py.test only runs to 3.3
[2014-07-02 09:15:13] tony3, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-02 09:15:33] dude-x: it should support 3.4 i thin
[2014-07-02 09:15:42] dude-x: let me check
[2014-07-02 09:16:12] ChammyCHam: according to this page it doesn't https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest
[2014-07-02 09:16:19] ChammyCHam: but then again the selenium page says it only supports 3.3 but it works with 3.4
[2014-07-02 09:16:48] dude-x: the differences are mnior
[2014-07-02 09:17:09] dude-x: actually, it's a major upgrade from 3.3, but it shouldn't break things
[2014-07-02 09:18:41] dude-x: ChammyCHam: how comfortable are you with python?
[2014-07-02 09:19:09] ChammyCHam: i'm pretty new overall but have all the basic concepts down but a lot of it is learning as i go
[2014-07-02 09:19:41] ChammyCHam: the biggest trouble i've had is a lot of documentation assumes i know other things so it's an endless chain of following the logic around figuring out what every piece is
[2014-07-02 09:20:04] dude-x: well some basic concpepts of a test runner is this
[2014-07-02 09:20:13] dude-x: you want a test runner to find the tests for you to run automatically
[2014-07-02 09:20:19] dude-x: py.test does this, unittest2 does this
[2014-07-02 09:20:38] dude-x: some tests require preparation, which is the Setup/Before of a test
[2014-07-02 09:20:57] dude-x: and then some tests require clean up, which is the teardown/after of a test
[2014-07-02 09:21:27] dude-x: py.test uses "fixtures" to handle setup/teardown, while unittest lets you define these as simple functions
[2014-07-02 09:21:36] Bebe_sel, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-07-02 09:22:17] dude-x: test runners also give you powerful assert features
[2014-07-02 09:22:19] ChammyCHam: so in python 3.4.1 import unittest2 seems to return an error, is that all merged into unittest at this point?
[2014-07-02 09:22:36] ChammyCHam: and i'm used to defining test cases myself, i don't exactly understand how a test runner could find and run tests automatically
[2014-07-02 09:22:40] dude-x: unittest has custom asserts; py.test uses the native assert mechanism but rewrites it to be more informative
[2014-07-02 09:22:54] Bebe_sel, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-02 09:22:57] dude-x: it's just a program that looks for stuff in all directories
[2014-07-02 09:23:02] WhereIsMySpoon: ChammyCHam: a test runner finds tests you've written and runs them
[2014-07-02 09:23:23] ChammyCHam: oh ok
[2014-07-02 09:23:29] dude-x: usually it will look for something that starts with "Test""test" or in unittest case something that inherits TestCase
[2014-07-02 09:23:42] ChammyCHam: so you don't have to point to all the files manually
[2014-07-02 09:23:48] WhereIsMySpoon: yarp
[2014-07-02 09:24:01] ChammyCHam: interesting.  this is a lot of information.  feel like i just dove into the ocean and am learning how to swim lol
[2014-07-02 09:25:13] dude-x: it's a lot of info, but it's very high level; it will make sense once you start writing more tests

[2014-07-02 09:39:09] cgoldberg: most everything in the python testing world is an extension to unittest.. so that's a great place to start.  I personally like testtools extensions a lot
[2014-07-02 09:39:15] ChammyCHam: interesting
[2014-07-02 09:39:54] ChammyCHam: so i need to test in multiple browsers, looks like chrome driver requires some different stuff to setup, can i test all 3 browsers from the same code?  how do i implement this without tangling things incorrectly
[2014-07-02 09:40:05] cgoldberg: ChammyCHam, i recommend starting with plain 'ol unittest from python standard library
[2014-07-02 09:40:25] cgoldberg: ChammyCHam, you can use a package called 'testscenarios'

[2014-07-02 11:47:10] dude-x: figuring out a locator is a skill in itself; but in general, an ID is fastest, otherwise use a CSS Selector or XPath to find an element; and you want these locators to be very generic so that they don't break if the UI changes structure

[2014-07-02 11:52:03] jleyba: and other JS type failures from outdated browser detection in Se Core
[2014-07-02 11:52:05] smyers: ChammyCHam, in my tests that's exactly how I check to see if the browser's logged in. The login form only appears on the login page, and the div with the username in it only appears if you're logged in.
[2014-07-02 11:52:12] smyers: It varies from UI to UI, of course

[2014-07-02 15:24:00] ato: ChammyCHam: unittest.main() is magical.
[2014-07-02 15:25:02] ChammyCHam: so just use it and don't question it?
[2014-07-02 15:25:16] ChammyCHam: and does that need to be in each of my test files?
[2014-07-02 15:25:20] ato: ChammyCHam: What it does is to take your filename and reflect upon it to find any classes defined that are subclasses of unittest.TestCase.  These are then imported, the classes inspected and a list of test cases is constructed and passed to unittest's proper run method.
[2014-07-02 15:25:29] ChammyCHam: i did a pretty simple test and took 26 seconsd to run which surprised me but maybe our site was being slow
[2014-07-02 15:25:41] ChammyCHam: ah interesting
[2014-07-02 15:25:58] ChammyCHam: so if they were in multiple files would they still run? or just ones within this file?
[2014-07-02 15:26:29] ato: An if __name__ == "__main__" applies strictly to that file.
[2014-07-02 15:26:48] ato: You can write another program which runs tests in multiple files if you wish.
[2014-07-02 15:27:13] ato: Or you can do `python -m unittest discover test_file_a test_file_b` from command line.
[2014-07-02 15:27:17] rodrigomartin, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-07-02 15:27:25] ChammyCHam: gotcha.  so in programming usually you have your classes separate from your code....but do you encapsalte all your tests in classes so that doesn't really apply here?  and you just group your classes in files based on what is being tested?
[2014-07-02 15:27:53] AutomatedTester: wilhelm: will do
[2014-07-02 15:27:53] ato: I wouldn't be as general as that.
[2014-07-02 15:28:08] ato: unittest is special in this regard, in that it imposes certain rules on how your tests needs to be structured.
[2014-07-02 15:28:47] ChammyCHam: man....this is tough
[2014-07-02 15:28:58] ato: You could just as easily write a .py file with tests outside a class and use a test runner like nosetest to execute them.
[2014-07-02 15:29:04] ato: Or py.test.

[2014-07-02 15:29:21] ChammyCHam: stock is confusing enough let alone implementing third-party stuff.  it's hard to find info that doesn't assume you know a ton of stuff
[2014-07-02 15:29:32] barancev: well, I always knew py.test is better :)
[2014-07-02 15:29:42] ato: ChammyCHam: Yeah so you have three components here which are unrelated.
[2014-07-02 15:30:15] ato: ChammyCHam: There's Selenium which is a stand-alone library, e.g. you can use it in a normal Python program that doesn't test anything.
[2014-07-02 15:30:40] ato: ChammyCHam: There's the test framework which provides you with a set of functions to do assertions and usually some sort of result report.

[2014-07-02 15:57:00] dogarrhea: hrm. using Thread.sleep is more reliable and faster than spin wait
[2014-07-02 15:57:28] dogarrhea: i know what you're thinking. but when your'e waiting for a particular div to stop updating its contents, the alternative is wait until staleness
[2014-07-02 15:57:36] dogarrhea: and then keep waiting. it's longer
[2014-07-02 15:57:40] ChammyCHam: pycharm seems good but i would like to avoid having to learn an IDE on top of everything else
[2014-07-02 15:58:24] dogarrhea: and when there are actual hard coded time constraints on the elements in the div and something updates every 5 seconds due to long polling
[2014-07-02 15:58:34] dogarrhea: you really can't expectedCondition anymore
[2014-07-02 15:58:37] dogarrhea: it's stupid

[2014-07-02 15:59:36] ChammyCHam: my brain hurts
[2014-07-02 16:00:06] eusid: Anybody knows how I can change the value of navigator.plugins without installing or removing any of my plugins?
[2014-07-02 16:00:38] AutomatedTester: eusid: I dont think you can from webdriver
[2014-07-02 16:00:43] ChammyCHam: these failure messages are so verbose and seem to include a bunch of junk.  any way to clean it up and stick to just the assertion error
[2014-07-02 16:00:55] ato: eusid: I think navigator.plugins is immutable.
[2014-07-02 16:00:57] AutomatedTester: eusid: you need browser chrome access and webdriver cant acess that
[2014-07-02 16:01:23] eusid: AutomatedTester: So if I were using chrome I can change this?

[2014-07-02 16:02:50] ato: The UI of your browser, everything outside the viewport, is commonly referred to as the chrome.
[2014-07-02 16:04:09] AutomatedTester: and the highly privledged areas of browser
[2014-07-02 16:04:27] ato: ChammyCHam: Granted, Python's stack traces aren't very good, but I wouldn't classify them as “junk” (-:
[2014-07-02 16:04:31] eusid: Ah, is there any tools available that will give me the functionality i seek? but now that i know i can't do this with selenium i guess i just have to have my code to remove my plugins
[2014-07-02 16:05:02] AutomatedTester: night all
[2014-07-02 16:05:05] eusid: that said is there an easy way to start with 0 plugins because selenium is making a copy of my default profile and i have loads of add ons
[2014-07-02 16:05:11] ato: eusid: I think what you want to do is to instrument the browser somehow to disable all plugins.
[2014-07-02 16:05:26] ato: AutomatedTester: Night!
[2014-07-02 16:05:30] garndt: Night AutomatedTester
[2014-07-02 16:05:41] eusid: ato: starting the browser in safe mode?
[2014-07-02 16:05:42] ato: eusid: Typically that means providing a custom profile to the browser.
[2014-07-02 16:05:55] ato: eusid: Yeah, doing that might work actually.

[2014-07-02 16:06:30] ato: It is in Python.
[2014-07-02 16:06:44] barancev: oh... is python different?
[2014-07-02 16:06:59] ato: For strange, inexplicable reasons.
[2014-07-02 16:07:11] barancev: shit happens :)
[2014-07-02 16:07:33] barancev: why not fix it right now? :)
[2014-07-02 16:07:44] ato: Because FirefoxProfile in Python is a mess.
[2014-07-02 16:07:51] ato: And it would take some time to untangle.

[2014-07-02 16:12:09] eusid: So when i create a new profile what is it that I set to remove addons? If i set enabledAddons to a blank string all add ons are still enabled
[2014-07-02 16:12:17] eusid: or to disable them rather

[2014-07-02 16:13:55] ato: I have consequently avoided looking at FirefoxProfile.  So I don't know the answer to that.
[2014-07-02 16:14:05] eusid: so is using java really the solution? is the python version of selenium messed up so bad that its not useable
[2014-07-02 16:14:39] ato: It's usable, but FirefoxProfile specifically is a bad piece of engineering IMHO.
[2014-07-02 16:14:57] ato: (FWIW I don't think it's much better in Java.)
[2014-07-02 16:15:23] ato: The best profile interaction library I know of is mozprofile.

[2014-07-02 16:16:07] eusid: well do u know what information i should be changing in the profile to do this? i'd rather not have to do something hacky like safemode
[2014-07-02 16:16:34] eusid: i looked at all the plugin keys and none of them seem to do what i need
[2014-07-02 16:16:51] eusid: new profile is still a copy even if i over ride enabled addons
