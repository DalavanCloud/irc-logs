[2014-07-09 01:42:14] ato: Well I don't think the WebDriver spec should invent its own algorithm for serializing XML.
[2014-07-09 01:42:14] ato: So if they don't have that interface they don't support DOM Parsing, and they're not conformant to the WebDriver spec.

[2014-07-09 04:16:20] lukeis: barancev: only 33399 is similar to our issue
[2014-07-09 04:16:49] lukeis: we need to escalate with our google contacts
[2014-07-09 04:16:59] lukeis: i believe ato is emailing (soon?) :)
[2014-07-09 04:17:00] barancev: lukeis: they are all about "raw files in git repo"
[2014-07-09 04:17:09] barancev: like ours
[2014-07-09 04:17:11] lukeis: no, some of those were about "releases"
[2014-07-09 04:17:19] lukeis: different
[2014-07-09 04:17:40] lukeis: if you look at the url's they log in their bugs
[2014-07-09 04:18:12] lukeis: and the only one i said was similar was in an hg repo ;)
[2014-07-09 04:18:39] lukeis: and the others were obviously trying to kludge in their own "downloads" thing again, which google isn't supporting
[2014-07-09 04:19:14] lukeis: what if they're doing this now as a stop-gap to avoid "downloading" from git repos?
[2014-07-09 04:19:21] barancev: lukeis: e.g. 32586 -- go to the repo https://code.google.com/p/repository-lsellens/source/browse/repo/service.downloadmanager.SickPotatoHead/service.downloadmanager.SickPotatoHead-1.3.0.zip
[2014-07-09 04:19:28] barancev: and click "view raw file"
[2014-07-09 04:19:54] lukeis: yeah, but it's a download… which is against what they want to support
[2014-07-09 04:20:01] lukeis: not a good case to point out ;)
[2014-07-09 04:20:04] barancev: it is not a download
[2014-07-09 04:20:12] lukeis: "download" is in the file name!
[2014-07-09 04:20:13] barancev: it is a binary file stored in the repo
[2014-07-09 04:20:26] lukeis: seems like it to me

[2014-07-09 07:12:35] WhereIsMySpoon: eh?
[2014-07-09 07:12:40] lukeis: javascript...

[2014-07-09 07:13:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i know what async and sync are
[2014-07-09 07:13:26] WhereIsMySpoon: and what they mean
[2014-07-09 07:13:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i just dont understand how this relates
[2014-07-09 07:13:40] lukeis: trying to do something synchronously in an async environment (javascript) is very difficult
[2014-07-09 07:13:49] lukeis: and why alert handling is not implemented in phantomjs
[2014-07-09 07:13:53] WhereIsMySpoon: js is all async?
[2014-07-09 07:13:59] lukeis: …. yes
[2014-07-09 07:14:01] WhereIsMySpoon: I see
[2014-07-09 07:14:10] AutomatedTester: who wudda thunk it

[2014-07-09 07:14:21] WhereIsMySpoon: I do 0 server side js
[2014-07-09 07:14:51] WhereIsMySpoon: why is there an option to explicitly do executeAsyncScript
[2014-07-09 07:14:55] WhereIsMySpoon: as opposed to executeScript
[2014-07-09 07:14:58] WhereIsMySpoon: surely its all async
[2014-07-09 07:15:09] WhereIsMySpoon: for the javascriptexecutor that is
[2014-07-09 07:15:23] lukeis: javascript does "sync" it just blocks the UI thread and doesn't allow any other operations to happen

[2014-07-09 07:15:46] WhereIsMySpoon: ah
[2014-07-09 07:15:46] lukeis: executeAsyncScript is a very mis-understood command
[2014-07-09 07:16:57] lukeis: it's to allow you to provide a callback that will get called (asynchronously) for when the driver responds to the command… so in your client language  "driver.executeAsyncScript"  is "synchronous" meaning it's blocking and waiting for the response :)
[2014-07-09 07:18:11] lukeis: driver.executeAsyncScript("var cb = arguments[0]; window.setTimeout(function(){cb();}, 1000);")  <-    is effectively a 1 second sleep :)

[2014-07-09 07:21:11] WhereIsMySpoon: linktext only works on <a>
[2014-07-09 07:21:38] lukeis: we have the ability to inject different page objects based on BrowserType and in this case override the utilities for alert handling just for a browser type (like phantomjs ;) )

[2014-07-09 07:27:42] WhereIsMySpoon: having <a><button>sometext</button></a> doesnt mean that you can do By.linkText("sometext")

[2014-07-09 07:48:43] lukeis: fly2web: have you read docs.seleniumhq.org ?
[2014-07-09 07:48:51] jibran_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-09 07:48:55] fly2web: i dont read it.
[2014-07-09 07:48:58] fly2web: where?
[2014-07-09 07:49:03] lukeis: click it ;)
[2014-07-09 07:49:36] lukeis: fly2web: should start with http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp
[2014-07-09 07:49:38] fly2web: thanks lukeis
[2014-07-09 07:49:42] Cz: yeah, in my @Setup I initalize my firefoxDriver and chromeDriver, I'm just wondering if through the code should I just be writing the same commands for the two webdrivers?
[2014-07-09 07:49:55] Cz: or is there a better way of having it run through all the drivers and perform the same tests
[2014-07-09 07:49:57] lukeis: Cz: no, no, no
[2014-07-09 07:50:02] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: let me write an example
[2014-07-09 07:50:02] lukeis: one driver instance
[2014-07-09 07:50:23] Cz: oh, so one driver for multiple browsers?
[2014-07-09 07:50:24] lukeis: test runner should do the looping...
[2014-07-09 07:50:33] lukeis: yes
[2014-07-09 07:50:44] Cz: alright, cool I didn't know you could do that!
[2014-07-09 07:50:48] fly2web: lukeis: i install selenium, but there is no python but there is ruby, java, c#.
[2014-07-09 07:50:51] Cz: this thing is pretty amazing
[2014-07-09 07:50:53] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: http://pastie.org/9371742
[2014-07-09 07:50:58] WhereIsMySpoon: do something like that
[2014-07-09 07:51:00] lukeis: your test should ideally not care about the browser… BUT you should have an ability to override functionality per browser ;)
[2014-07-09 07:51:18] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to use specific browsers
[2014-07-09 07:51:22] WhereIsMySpoon: put that in a separate java file
[2014-07-09 07:51:28] lukeis: fly2web: there is python? or you saying you don't have python?
[2014-07-09 07:51:32] WhereIsMySpoon: then in your @Before, initialise your webdriver field
[2014-07-09 07:51:36] WhereIsMySpoon: with that method
[2014-07-09 07:51:41] WhereIsMySpoon: assuming you have that enum set up

[2014-07-09 07:52:31] fly2web: export test suite as —> ruby, java, c# and there is no python. lukeis
[2014-07-09 07:52:36] WhereIsMySpoon: you're using the ide
[2014-07-09 07:52:38] WhereIsMySpoon: stop it
[2014-07-09 07:52:42] lukeis: heh
[2014-07-09 07:52:49] Cz: alright thanks spoon, if I get stuck can I come back to you on this? I'm still relatively new to coding too so as I said sorry for being slow :P
[2014-07-09 07:52:56] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz:if im here sure
[2014-07-09 07:53:01] WhereIsMySpoon: just ask questions to the channel
[2014-07-09 07:53:04] WhereIsMySpoon: if theyre general
[2014-07-09 07:53:11] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis:I will convert all ide users
[2014-07-09 07:53:16] WhereIsMySpoon: !
[2014-07-09 07:53:21] lukeis: fly2web: and it's "Export Test Case"  not "Suite"
[2014-07-09 07:53:28] lukeis: there's python there
[2014-07-09 07:54:00] lukeis: the Suite thing doesn't really work from my experience

[2014-07-09 07:54:28] WhereIsMySpoon: set up the tests properly from scratch in python
[2014-07-09 07:54:32] WhereIsMySpoon: using webdriver
[2014-07-09 07:54:43] WhereIsMySpoon: the ide generates crappy, unmaintainable code that is unreliable
[2014-07-09 07:55:00] WhereIsMySpoon: it also has very little in terms of features compared to webdriver

[2014-07-09 08:20:50] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: I kinda have stuff like this...I have a "CommonActions" class where I keep stuff like login etc
[2014-07-09 08:21:22] WhereIsMySpoon: usually if I use something on a page more than 2 or 3 times I section it into a method and put it there
[2014-07-09 08:21:37] WhereIsMySpoon: so basically I have a pageobject model for like...all pages
[2014-07-09 08:21:49] WhereIsMySpoon: in one class
[2014-07-09 08:22:08] lukeis: for items that are common on multiple pages I use what I call "widget" objects, they know how to interact with the widget and can exist on any given page object

[2014-07-09 08:22:38] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-07-09 08:22:39] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-07-09 08:22:49] lukeis: (which is an anti-pattern ;) )
[2014-07-09 08:22:52] WhereIsMySpoon: pff
[2014-07-09 08:22:56] WhereIsMySpoon: its an AWESOME pattern
[2014-07-09 08:22:59] WhereIsMySpoon: amirite
[2014-07-09 08:23:02] WhereIsMySpoon: (im not)
[2014-07-09 08:23:05] ShadowXOR: my preferred patter is hounds tooth
[2014-07-09 08:23:12] lukeis: i once worked on a project with a "god.py"
[2014-07-09 08:23:22] lukeis: … it controlled everythin
[2014-07-09 08:23:24] lukeis: g
[2014-07-09 08:23:43] lukeis: it was the scariest file to modify...
[2014-07-09 08:23:54] ShadowXOR: should rename it don't touch .py
[2014-07-09 08:24:00] lukeis: and python isn't normally scary to modify ;)
[2014-07-09 08:24:14] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-07-09 08:24:39] WhereIsMySpoon: I think the problem with this approach for me at least
[2014-07-09 08:24:47] WhereIsMySpoon: is that our pages have a *lot* going on in them
[2014-07-09 08:25:07] WhereIsMySpoon: it would be more effort to make a page object model than to make functionality for each bit of the different pages

[2014-07-09 08:33:41] kallisti: hey, so many moons ago I was digging through webdriver client source code and found an undocumented 405 JSON response code, and I'm wondering if this response code is still in use.
[2014-07-09 08:33:52] kallisti: I have a case for it in the Haskell client code, and I'm wondering if I should just delete it completely.
[2014-07-09 08:33:54] ShadowXOR: Is phantom js it's own thing or is it supposed to replicate other browsers?

[2014-07-09 08:37:41] dude-x: phantomJS is a headless webkit browser;
[2014-07-09 08:37:56] dude-x: it doessn't have a visible browser, but it can still do screenshots
[2014-07-09 08:38:04] Cz: my eclipse doesn't want to import lukeis prokect for some reason :'(
[2014-07-09 08:38:19] WhereIsMySpoon: I wouldnt want to import luke either
[2014-07-09 08:38:23] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-07-09 08:38:25] lukeis: i wouldn't either ;)
[2014-07-09 08:38:29] ShadowXOR: yeah, i know what it is, i'm just not sure what it exactly solves if you need to support these 3 browsers, if it works with that does it guarantee it works with certain browsers
[2014-07-09 08:38:29] dude-x: it's fast because it's not rendering stuff on screen, but it's not quite like Chrome or Firefox, plus it has a few issues
[2014-07-09 08:38:36] lukeis: Cz: it's a maven project

[2014-07-09 08:40:17] WhereIsMySpoon: yea i was looking at it
[2014-07-09 08:40:32] WhereIsMySpoon: i didnt want to replicate effort
[2014-07-09 08:40:36] WhereIsMySpoon: if he already started
[2014-07-09 08:40:57] WhereIsMySpoon: why is his main rb file in bin/ :p
[2014-07-09 08:41:01] lukeis: jarib_ is a machine… so whenever he wants something new in it, guarantee it'd be already done
[2014-07-09 08:41:02] WhereIsMySpoon: surely it should be src
[2014-07-09 08:41:28] Cz: Spoon, what I've done was: http://pastie.org/9371863#
[2014-07-09 08:41:42] Cz: but as soon as I wrote it I realised that I'm never going to reach test with the first drivers

[2014-07-09 08:41:58] WhereIsMySpoon: you're iterating over enums with ints xD
[2014-07-09 08:42:02] WhereIsMySpoon: I mean it *technically* works
[2014-07-09 08:42:02] Cz: yeah
[2014-07-09 08:42:03] Cz: i was like
[2014-07-09 08:42:07] Cz: "fuck enum"
[2014-07-09 08:42:13] lukeis: ha
[2014-07-09 08:42:25] Dave_B_: :o
[2014-07-09 08:42:28] WhereIsMySpoon: you can just do Utils.MySupportedDriversEnum.values
[2014-07-09 08:42:33] WhereIsMySpoon: and iterate over that
[2014-07-09 08:42:41] Cz: aaaaanyway
[2014-07-09 08:42:55] Cz: this means that it'll only test the last browser to load up
[2014-07-09 08:43:00] WhereIsMySpoon: why are you doing      selenium = new WebDriverBackedSelenium(myDriver, baseUrl);
[2014-07-09 08:43:01] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 768
[2014-07-09 08:43:04] WhereIsMySpoon: dont use this selenium object
[2014-07-09 08:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: WebDriver is a replacement for it
[2014-07-09 08:43:17] Cz: you know how I've said
[2014-07-09 08:43:21] lukeis: Cz: your code is extremely flawed… it's equivalent to myDriver = getWebDriver(1);
[2014-07-09 08:43:22] Cz: "I don't know what I'm doing" :D
[2014-07-09 08:43:27] lukeis: no for looping required...

[2014-07-09 08:43:55] Dave_B_: WebDriverBackedSelenium isn't what you want, WebDriver is
[2014-07-09 08:44:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: what I've done is I have a properties file with a property 'browserToUse'
[2014-07-09 08:44:14] WhereIsMySpoon: I read from that property on startup
[2014-07-09 08:44:23] WhereIsMySpoon: and that deals with what browser I initialise
[2014-07-09 08:44:51] WhereIsMySpoon: with a method similar to getWebdriver that I wrote in that code snippet I pastied to you

[2014-07-09 08:45:45] Dave_B_: haha I've been there Cz, it's tough to start when the explanations use words you don't understand
[2014-07-09 08:45:51] Cz: Can't, no time
[2014-07-09 08:45:52] Cz: boss was like
[2014-07-09 08:45:58] Cz: "Yo, go test our website"
[2014-07-09 08:46:06] Cz: and gave me a gazzilion test cases
[2014-07-09 08:46:06] Cz: :D
[2014-07-09 08:46:12] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont *need* automated testing to test a website
[2014-07-09 08:46:17] WhereIsMySpoon: its just better
[2014-07-09 08:46:28] Cz: they do
[2014-07-09 08:46:34] Cz: acceptance testing for the client or something
[2014-07-09 08:46:38] WhereIsMySpoon: I can almost guarantee that setting up and implementing automated tests will take longer than manually doing them
[2014-07-09 08:46:39] Cz: and need to check it works with every release
[2014-07-09 08:46:57] WhereIsMySpoon: It just saves time if you repeat testing
[2014-07-09 08:47:00] WhereIsMySpoon: and is more reliable
[2014-07-09 08:47:02] WhereIsMySpoon: etc etc
[2014-07-09 08:47:17] WhereIsMySpoon: If you are strapped for time and cannot code, I dont recommend trying to make automated tests
[2014-07-09 08:47:27] WhereIsMySpoon: you'll create sub-par tests and will be frustrated
[2014-07-09 08:47:37] WhereIsMySpoon: come back to this when you got some time :)
[2014-07-09 08:47:56] Cz: I'll just work at it
[2014-07-09 08:48:03] Cz: i've already got a nice 20 inefficient test
[2014-07-09 08:48:11] Cz: which test what I want and give me a screenshot if it fails

[2014-07-09 08:49:29] WhereIsMySpoon: I was just saying that if you are really strapped for time then automated testing is probably something you should try to setup after you deliver your test results to your boss
[2014-07-09 08:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: manually
[2014-07-09 08:49:40] WhereIsMySpoon: but up to u
[2014-07-09 08:49:48] Cz: oh, he wants the automated testing
[2014-07-09 08:49:50] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-07-09 08:49:55] Cz: he recommended selenium and JMeter
[2014-07-09 08:49:59] WhereIsMySpoon: so you arent a coder
[2014-07-09 08:50:06] WhereIsMySpoon: and he just said "go and code some automated tests"?
[2014-07-09 08:50:07] Cz: I have... 1 year uni experience
[2014-07-09 08:50:28] WhereIsMySpoon: then I think your uni education and college education is a bit lacking in terms of programming experience

[2014-07-09 08:54:28] WhereIsMySpoon: In my project
[2014-07-09 08:54:31] Cz: so I should just make two drivers?
[2014-07-09 08:54:35] Cz: and run them both with the same code?
[2014-07-09 08:54:38] WhereIsMySpoon: no, wait

[2014-07-09 08:56:01] WhereIsMySpoon: and I look for the property "browserToUse"
[2014-07-09 08:56:10] Cz: right
[2014-07-09 08:56:11] WhereIsMySpoon: I pass that property into getWebdriver
[2014-07-09 08:56:21] Cz: and that chooses firefox/chrome
[2014-07-09 08:56:25] WhereIsMySpoon: precisely
[2014-07-09 08:56:38] Cz: so do you just change that in your properties file

[2014-07-09 08:58:46] WhereIsMySpoon: its more the fact that 6 motnhs down the line someone will be like "wtf does this do"
[2014-07-09 08:58:52] WhereIsMySpoon: if you use the enum they wont
[2014-07-09 08:59:09] WhereIsMySpoon: this is more pertinent for larger more complex projects

[2014-07-09 08:59:51] WhereIsMySpoon: its one of the big things that employers will look for is the quality of your code
[2014-07-09 09:00:07] WhereIsMySpoon: you will work in teams in a full time job usually
[2014-07-09 09:00:13] Cz: Yeah :)
[2014-07-09 09:00:27] WhereIsMySpoon: if you write crap code that nobody can read or update then you'll be out of a job pretty soon

[2014-07-09 09:01:07] WhereIsMySpoon: as a result, it is easy to see what everything does, even for non technical people
[2014-07-09 09:01:12] Cz: unless you freelance code for a company and then they can't hire anyone to do it beacuse they look at it and are like "what the fuck is this" so they keep bringing you back to fix it ;)
[2014-07-09 09:01:18] WhereIsMySpoon: meaning I can get people to adopt it more easily
[2014-07-09 09:01:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: or they fire you because you write crap code and get someone else to write it

[2014-07-09 09:34:49] Zoddie: Hey guys, I have a do .click() while isElementPresent (in order to continually refresh until particular information appears). I need Selenium to detect when that particular information appears, iand to perform another function when that particular information appears. What is the best way to go about that (I am using Java).
[2014-07-09 09:35:52] Zoddie: this is my work so far: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc454741590e53b31f0d
[2014-07-09 09:37:31] lukeis: Zoddie: :waits
[2014-07-09 09:37:32] selbot2: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-and-implicit-waits
[2014-07-09 09:37:32] dude-x: Zoddie: what are you trying to do exactly?
[2014-07-09 09:37:45] lukeis: he's trying to wait for it to be visible and then click ;)
[2014-07-09 09:37:51] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-09 09:37:57] dude-x: that code is the wrong order then
[2014-07-09 09:38:14] Zoddie: when what i want to become visible appears, i want it to notify me that this : link=IHG-apps-disk 45739 appears
[2014-07-09 09:38:17] Zoddie: that target
[2014-07-09 09:38:33] Zoddie: so what u see there is it jsut continually refreshing via "click pause"
[2014-07-09 09:38:35] dude-x: use a webdriver wait
[2014-07-09 09:39:06] Zoddie: What I want to become visible: link=IHG-apps-disk 45739   ... when that is visible - perform action "play sound"
[2014-07-09 09:39:11] Zoddie: i can figure out the latter part
[2014-07-09 09:39:21] Zoddie: but how to integrate that with my current do while loop is the issue
[2014-07-09 09:39:29] Zoddie: i will look into webdriver wait dude-x  thanks
[2014-07-09 09:39:35] lukeis: WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("pause_all_btn"))).click();
[2014-07-09 09:39:43] lukeis: Zoddie: ^
[2014-07-09 09:40:27] Zoddie: So I should use that webdriver wait instead of do while loop
[2014-07-09 09:40:45] lukeis: yes
[2014-07-09 09:40:51] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-07-09 09:42:46] Zoddie: in short -> code is to click "pause_all_btn" two times (check, uncheck)  -> until this link element appears: link=IHG-apps-disk -> then play sound

[2014-07-09 09:44:57] Zoddie: lukeis: do you see where just using the webdriver wait wouldn't be so efficient, because it takes to check "pause_all_btn" then check again "pause_all_btn" = 1 refresh
[2014-07-09 09:45:10] Zoddie: 2 clicks on "pause_all_btn" = 1 refresh
[2014-07-09 09:45:36] Zoddie: play sound is what i will tell Java to do on the event, or maybe display a popup dialogue
[2014-07-09 09:45:46] lukeis: i have no idea what your web app is or what it does
[2014-07-09 09:45:49] Zoddie: i need to be alerted when link element link=IHG-apps-disk appears
[2014-07-09 09:47:02] Zoddie: lukeis: the web app displays trouble tickets. It requires two clicks on pause_all_button to update the list of tickets. When "link=IHG-apps-disk" appears in the list of tickets, i need to be alerted
[2014-07-09 09:47:27] lukeis: you want to automate this process?
[2014-07-09 09:47:30] Zoddie: so far as you know my work only does "two clicks on pause_all_buttons to update lsit of tickets"
[2014-07-09 09:47:39] Zoddie: yes
[2014-07-09 09:48:37] lukeis: yeah, so if I wanted it to indefinitely wait for the pause all button… I would loop in a while loop (with a sleep) until that initial condition is met
[2014-07-09 09:48:55] lukeis: and then do the click / click / wait / alert
[2014-07-09 09:49:33] lukeis: and then loop the whole process
[2014-07-09 09:50:31] Zoddie: ok, I am a bit new with java and having trouble visualizing the format of the process
[2014-07-09 09:50:42] Zoddie: what do you suggest would go in the do { }
[2014-07-09 09:51:22] lukeis: while (true) {   while(true) { check for initial condition if true break; sleep 500ms; };   click(); click(); wait(); alert(); }
[2014-07-09 09:51:29] lukeis: pseudo code ;)

[2014-07-09 10:24:38] kek: same problems same issues
[2014-07-09 10:24:54] kek: all of these are hacks for fundamental problems with selenium
[2014-07-09 10:24:59] kek: and they are poor hacks at that.
[2014-07-09 10:25:21] kek: who doesn't upload things to the internet lol
[2014-07-09 10:26:05] kek: half our workflow is on the other side of "upload things to the internet" and now we are looking at increasing our test time to 10 extra minutes uploading 1 file at a time or just not automating this fundamental aspect of our application at all
[2014-07-09 10:26:15] kek: or using some stupid hack like autoit
[2014-07-09 10:27:52] Zoddie: ur talking about automating through some website upload forms to include a file on ur hd?
[2014-07-09 10:28:25] kek: yes. you must upload a file and then click some buttons when the file upload is done. our app allows multiple uploads, up to 15 documents simultaneously
[2014-07-09 10:28:34] kek: it's like testing gmail attachment functionality
[2014-07-09 10:28:50] kek: i doubt they use selenium for that heh
[2014-07-09 10:29:31] kek: or testing facebook photo upload functionality.
[2014-07-09 10:30:21] kek: uploading files is extremely extremely common. don't know why this is a limitation in selenium. corporate open source i guess
[2014-07-09 10:31:07] kek: or if this is "too hard to fix" you kind of wonder what direction selenium is going in
[2014-07-09 10:31:10] Zoddie: so selenium can't work within the explorer browser form where you can view/select files?
[2014-07-09 10:31:41] kek: I can repeatedly click click click click click click click and attempt to wait for single files to upload 1 at a time
[2014-07-09 10:31:58] Zoddie: u cannot give a "hold ctrl" command as you click click clikc (selecting multiple) ?
[2014-07-09 10:31:59] kek: the input is hidden after a successful upload. this is a feature of our app
[2014-07-09 10:32:14] kek: Zoddie, this involves awt robot as you mentioned or autoit
[2014-07-09 10:32:18] kek: and is OS level
[2014-07-09 10:32:31] kek: i mind as well automate IE through windows api
[2014-07-09 10:32:49] kek: get the hwnd handle, blah blah blah blah blah hack etc
[2014-07-09 10:33:19] kek: and actually waiting for the file upload to complete so the user can interact again?
[2014-07-09 10:33:47] kek: this is asking for flakey selenium
[2014-07-09 10:34:59] kek: there are other limitations with selenium upload today... hidden inputs are becoming more and more frequent with things like angular or 3rd party libraries that actually set the input contents while only providing a facade to interact with

[2014-07-09 11:47:53] barancev: do you think "true opensource" is a software developed by unemployyed people only?
[2014-07-09 11:48:02] kek: i didn't say that
[2014-07-09 11:48:10] kek: i said Selenium is coporate open source
