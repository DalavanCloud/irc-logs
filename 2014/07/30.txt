[2014-07-30 02:15:11] Joe_____: I need help with selenium webdriver. How write command as in selenium IDE? It is possible?
[2014-07-30 02:15:22] simonstewart: ?
[2014-07-30 02:15:35] simonstewart: You can get IDE to output webdriver as well as rc output
[2014-07-30 02:16:02] Joe_____: I don't know how it works
[2014-07-30 02:16:13] simonstewart: Ah. That’s a different problem :)
[2014-07-30 02:16:14] Joe_____: How I can do that?
[2014-07-30 02:16:18] simonstewart: What are you trying to do
[2014-07-30 02:16:18] simonstewart: ?
[2014-07-30 02:16:27] barancev: read the docs, may be? :)
[2014-07-30 02:17:46] Joe_____: I try to click on place in site, but selenium said me that "Element not found".
[2014-07-30 02:19:18] Dave_B_1: can you link us to the site & tell us how you're trying to locate the element?
[2014-07-30 02:19:19] Joe_____: I try perfomm it in IDE and convert in Java, but the same problem I got.
[2014-07-30 02:20:02] Dave_B_1: sounds like the locator is wrong or the element is in an iframe that you've not switched to, possibly something else like a timing issue
[2014-07-30 02:23:17] Joe_____: When I writing the code in WebDriver, how I will know the name ID of element?
[2014-07-30 02:24:56] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe_____: how should we know what your id is? You need to find out the locator for your element and write the code to locate it
[2014-07-30 02:25:06] WhereIsMySpoon: hello simonstewart btw :)

[2014-07-30 02:54:19] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe_____: right click the element in your browser -> inspect
[2014-07-30 02:54:29] WhereIsMySpoon: then look at the html
[2014-07-30 02:54:38] WhereIsMySpoon: if it has an id, use that
[2014-07-30 02:54:52] WhereIsMySpoon: if not, then its probably best to use a css selector

[2014-07-30 08:05:19] Naughtron: So here is my question: I was working on a simple Selenium unit test last night http://pastebin.com/1qRxStkJ. I'll be running these on a raspberry pi so I installed Iceweasel, with the thinking that I would just drive that using .Firefox().  When I run the test I get the following error http://pastebin.com/wRU58gQx. Is what I am doing supposed to work, and if so am I just doing it wrong?

[2014-07-30 08:06:21] WhereIsMySpoon: Naughtron: the test looks reasonable, it's entirely possible that Iceweasel does some different things under the hood from firefox
[2014-07-30 08:06:34] apollo13: no
[2014-07-30 08:06:39] apollo13: seems to be a headless system
[2014-07-30 08:06:52] WhereIsMySpoon: Oh
[2014-07-30 08:06:54] ato: Naughtron: Possible that it doesn't work with Iceweasel.
[2014-07-30 08:06:56] apollo13: either set the display properly or install a vnc server whatever
[2014-07-30 08:06:57] WhereIsMySpoon: Naughtron: is this headless?
[2014-07-30 08:07:10] WhereIsMySpoon: if so you cant use anything but phantomjs
[2014-07-30 08:07:25] Naughtron: It is not I only added Selenium through pip last night
[2014-07-30 08:07:26] WhereIsMySpoon: unless as apollo says you install a display
[2014-07-30 08:07:43] WhereIsMySpoon: Naughtron: so you can browser on iceweasel through a UI on this pi?
[2014-07-30 08:07:47] WhereIsMySpoon: browse*
[2014-07-30 08:07:51] Naughtron: yes
[2014-07-30 08:08:03] apollo13: and how exactly are you starting that script?

[2014-07-30 08:08:39] Naughtron: I'm running it from the commandline https://github.com/Naughtron/pi_python_project/blob/master/unit_tests/test.py

[2014-07-30 08:11:01] Naughtron: ok I'll have a look thank you
[2014-07-30 08:11:28] apollo13: that is definitelly not the issue, with no display firefox will never start up :)
[2014-07-30 08:11:44] WhereIsMySpoon: apollo13: he just said he does have a display
[2014-07-30 08:11:57] apollo13: WhereIsMySpoon: having a display doesn't mean much
[2014-07-30 08:12:13] apollo13: if you start that testscript over ssh or cron you still have no display even if you have one on the machine
[2014-07-30 08:12:28] Naughtron: I dont need to have it display I would just like it for now while I am writing the tests
[2014-07-30 08:12:31] apollo13: hence my question on how exactly he is startiong it
[2014-07-30 08:12:31] Dave_B_1: I'm not too familiar with iceweasel - i presume it lags firefox versions slightly? Migh tjust be too old for current version of the driver
[2014-07-30 08:12:32] WhereIsMySpoon: why via cron?
[2014-07-30 08:12:38] apollo13: Naughtron: yes you do
[2014-07-30 08:12:50] Naughtron: ok
[2014-07-30 08:12:50] WhereIsMySpoon: surely cron is on the system so it should work the same as initiating it from the cmd line
[2014-07-30 08:12:56] WhereIsMySpoon: provided you set any needed env vars
[2014-07-30 08:13:12] apollo13: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, but he obviously haven't done that
[2014-07-30 08:13:20] apollo13: hasn't*
[2014-07-30 08:13:38] apollo13: Dave_B_1: na it works just fine usually
[2014-07-30 08:13:44] Dave_B_1: fair enough
[2014-07-30 08:13:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Naughtron: the whole point of selenium for web testing is that it mimics a user
[2014-07-30 08:13:48] apollo13: granted, here it doesn't work at all, but I am using nightlies
[2014-07-30 08:14:03] WhereIsMySpoon: phantomjs is an exception for that of course..
[2014-07-30 08:14:14] WhereIsMySpoon: but then again, phantomjs isnt really the same as using a proper browser

[2014-07-30 08:18:17] apollo13: or on whatever display you run X
[2014-07-30 08:18:26] Naughtron: do I add that to the command line or in the script itself?
[2014-07-30 08:18:36] apollo13: for now just do it on the cmd line
[2014-07-30 08:18:43] Naughtron: ok

[2014-07-30 10:08:50] clemzd: here is the command : java -jar /usr/local/Cellar/selenium-server-standalone/2.42.2/libexec/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/usr/local/Cellar/chromedriver/2.10/bin/chromedriver
[2014-07-30 10:09:09] jleyba: invalid command line
[2014-07-30 10:09:18] KyleG: yeah that looks i nvalid you're not telling it if it's a node
[2014-07-30 10:09:19] KyleG: or the hub
[2014-07-30 10:09:23] KyleG: or if it has a config file
[2014-07-30 10:09:31] jleyba: jvm args need to be listed before the jar
[2014-07-30 10:09:41] KyleG: jleyba: Now that is wrong.

[2014-07-30 10:09:46] KyleG: no issues

[2014-07-30 10:10:03] clemzd: sorry
[2014-07-30 10:10:06] jleyba: best to properly structure your command line
[2014-07-30 10:10:21] clemzd: sure
[2014-07-30 10:10:27] clemzd: can you please help me to do that ?

[2014-07-30 10:11:27] jleyba: once you do that, open http://localhost:4444/wd/hub in a browser and try to create a chrome session
[2014-07-30 10:11:53] clemzd: the server starts well but the problem is a see something wrong in the log file : 13:10:55.710 INFO - Default driver org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver registration is skipped: registration capabilities Capabilities [{platform=WINDOWS, ensureCleanSession=true, browserName=internet explorer, version=}] does not match with current platform

[2014-07-30 10:12:09] jleyba: harmless message
[2014-07-30 10:12:29] jleyba: just telling you that it won't attempt to start IEDriver b/c that's not possible on mac
[2014-07-30 10:12:47] jleyba: I believe barancev changed the log level on that recently so you won't see it anymore

[2014-07-30 10:14:37] barancev: fixed, yes, in the trunk
[2014-07-30 10:14:37] clemzd: ok so i guess my problem is not here, after i want to run my mocha test on this code https://github.com/Clemzd/paige-tests
[2014-07-30 10:15:08] clemzd: ok thank you for this, you're the best
[2014-07-30 10:17:22] clemzd: indeed, i can run a chrome session so the problem is not related to selenium
[2014-07-30 10:19:10] jleyba: I have no idea what be-paige is, but if you're using selenium-webdriver under the hood, you need to put chromedriver on your path when you run mocha
[2014-07-30 10:19:31] jleyba: PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/chromedriver/2.10/bin/chromedriver mocha your_tests
[2014-07-30 10:20:17] clemzd: be-paige is a js framework write for my need which simplify the development using selenium
[2014-07-30 10:20:57] clemzd: mmh it doesn't work
[2014-07-30 10:21:09] clemzd: even if i configure the path that way

[2014-07-30 11:19:22] smccarthy: dimacus: I started using Selenium-Grid-Extras this week. I noticed that it only pulls the configs from the hub during the initial start, but lets say I updated the config after I initially start, and stop/start the node, I dont get the new config. I added "new ConfigPuller().updateFromRemote();" in startNodes() in my local copy. Do you see any issues with that ?
[2014-07-30 11:19:56] dimacus: no issue what is so ever, if you wanna send a PR i'll merge it
[2014-07-30 11:20:05] dimacus: i just never got a chance to implement it
[2014-07-30 11:20:28] dimacus: since the grid started to act out specifically with osx safari nodes, thus the issue i'm trying to debug
[2014-07-30 11:20:42] smccarthy: ok thanks. I'll send it later today or tomorrow. Its my first PR, just a heads up.
[2014-07-30 11:20:57] dimacus: if it passes tests and does not blow things up it's all good :)
[2014-07-30 11:21:02] smccarthy: haha k! :)
[2014-07-30 11:21:07] dimacus: i don't mind doing a config pull for nodes before each node is started

[2014-07-30 14:17:43] jimevans: nvreynolds: they're not (much) included in the .net bindings either. the reason for the exclusion in .net is that using lambda expressions is a well-understood skill for .net developers, and there are tons of examples of how that's supposed to work all over the net. and if a .net developer doesn't know how to use lambda expressions, they're not going to be effective .net developers for very long. could there be a similar logic with ruby blocks?

[2014-07-30 14:21:31] ato: As if it was magic.
[2014-07-30 14:21:44] ato: user*
[2014-07-30 14:22:03] jimevans: oh, i entirely agree. hence my reluctance to include canned implementations under the guise of "expected conditions"
[2014-07-30 14:22:07] jimevans: for .net
[2014-07-30 14:22:42] ato: Yeah, the expected conditions are especially icky.
[2014-07-30 14:24:06] ato: jimevans: My implementation: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/client/marionette/wait.py
[2014-07-30 14:25:02] ato: jimevans: The expected conditions are less beautiful: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/client/marionette/expected.py d-:
[2014-07-30 14:25:06] nvreynolds: hmmm.. I realize most of the functions in expected_condtions can be handled within a testframework themself.. and as for the waits I wasn’t even using expected conditions for that..  but my biggest hurdle going from python=>ruby was the invisiblity of element that I rewrote as a function in my helper file (this: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py#L159-L177)
[2014-07-30 14:26:17] jimevans: ato: your implementation is very similar to mine.
[2014-07-30 14:27:24] ato: jimevans: If I was redoing it in a proper language I'd use threads to get the durations right
[2014-07-30 14:31:50] AutomatedTester: I used threads once now I have 9p r9blems

[2014-07-30 14:51:58] cgoldberg: i otherwise hate comcast
[2014-07-30 14:53:22] garndt: I really do not want to support comcast but I think I'm running out of options.
[2014-07-30 14:54:03] cgoldberg: garndt, comcast is my only realistic option... unless I wanna downgrade to like 3 mbit and go DSL.  freakin monopoly
[2014-07-30 14:54:40] cgoldberg: i can't wait for 10 gigabit WiFi on my LAN though... Quantenna is shipping a chipset in 2015... so not too much longer :)

[2014-07-30 14:57:02] cgoldberg: my backup is xfinity wifi.... Comcast has absolutely covered my neighborhood with their wifi... they piggyback with cable modems that supply wifi...  another reason to own your own modem and router
[2014-07-30 14:57:16] jimevans, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-30 14:57:27] garndt: And it would cost me more up front because I will not use their hotspot enabled gateway
[2014-07-30 14:57:50] garndt: Ah yes, cgoldberg , that's exactly what I'm avoiding :)
[2014-07-30 14:58:24] ato: Backup lines!  You're all spoilt.
[2014-07-30 14:58:35] cgoldberg: garndt, modem is only $80.
[2014-07-30 14:58:53] garndt: My phone is my backup line. 4G here is somewhat reliable
[2014-07-30 14:59:05] KyleG: I used to do that
[2014-07-30 14:59:13] KyleG: but when we moved, our new place has 0 cell coverage
[2014-07-30 14:59:20] KyleG: have to use a microcell…which work with our internet lol
[2014-07-30 15:00:11] cgoldberg: i just got a t-mobile Cel-Fi signal booster.. haven't hooked it up yet
[2014-07-30 15:00:13] garndt: fortunately I live on the edge of Chicago where the coverage is fairly decent
[2014-07-30 15:00:55] KyleG: I'm on call 24/7 and my wife works from home
[2014-07-30 15:01:02] KyleG: so $24/mo for the backup DSL line is no brainer
