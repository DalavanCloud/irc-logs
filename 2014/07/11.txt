[2014-07-11 01:37:47] Dave_B_: hmm
[2014-07-11 01:38:04] Dave_B_: it's starting with a browser window open
[2014-07-11 01:38:08] Dave_B_: first loop should work
[2014-07-11 01:38:13] Dave_B_: then it closes the browser window
[2014-07-11 01:38:16] Dave_B_: and tries again
[2014-07-11 01:38:21] fly2web: yes. right.
[2014-07-11 01:38:24] fly2web: Dave_B_:
[2014-07-11 01:38:36] SamuraiJack, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2014-07-11 01:38:38] fly2web: but error occurs.
[2014-07-11 01:38:48] Dave_B_: in the first loop or the second?
[2014-07-11 01:38:57] Dave_B_: second loop will fail as there is no browser open any more
[2014-07-11 01:39:19] fly2web: first loop well, second loop occur error.
[2014-07-11 01:39:28] Dave_B_: ok
[2014-07-11 01:39:36] Dave_B_: why are you closing the window at the end of the first loop?
[2014-07-11 01:40:01] fly2web: because i want loop more than 1,000.
[2014-07-11 01:40:06] fly2web: or 10,000
[2014-07-11 01:40:19] Dave_B_: if it needs to be a fresh browser then use a different driver each time, if not then just move the driver closing statement left four spaces and change it into a driver.quit()
[2014-07-11 01:40:39] Dave_B_: you're never opening a new window
[2014-07-11 01:40:52] fly2web: oh
[2014-07-11 01:40:54] Dave_B_: so looping 10k times will still only mean you've got one window, or, as currently, 0
[2014-07-11 01:41:38] Dave_B_: (also, out of curiosity, why are you looping 10k times?)
[2014-07-11 01:42:32] fly2web: i want increase searching my web site.
[2014-07-11 01:42:38] Dave_B_: oh, jsut noticed you driver.quit() in teardown - in that case, jsut totally remove the line about driver.close_window()
[2014-07-11 01:43:00] Dave_B_: do you need each iteration to be in a fresh window?
[2014-07-11 01:43:35] fly2web: because my computer have pain to have multi window.
[2014-07-11 01:43:56] fly2web: so i want new window each other.
[2014-07-11 01:45:00] Dave_B_: I'm not suggesting you have multiple windows at once, 10k might be a bit much ;)
[2014-07-11 01:45:08] Dave_B_: but you can either do it all in one window
[2014-07-11 01:45:24] fly2web: all in windows
[2014-07-11 01:45:26] fly2web: how ?
[2014-07-11 01:45:30] Dave_B_: or you can have one window, do it once, close tyhat, open a new window, do it once, close that window etc etc
[2014-07-11 01:45:56] fly2web:  driver.close_window()
[2014-07-11 01:46:23] Dave_B_: jsut delete line 25
[2014-07-11 01:46:26] Dave_B_: make no other changes
[2014-07-11 01:46:30] Dave_B_: you'll search over and over
[2014-07-11 01:46:41] Dave_B_: all in one browser window
[2014-07-11 01:47:03] Dave_B_: until whoever http://www.daum.net/ are ban you for being a bot anyway!
[2014-07-11 01:48:14] fly2web: finally all windows will closed.
[2014-07-11 01:48:20] fly2web: after looping
[2014-07-11 01:48:33] Dave_B_: after looping it'll run teardown, which will close your window
[2014-07-11 01:48:51] fly2web: ok i see. thanks
[2014-07-11 01:48:56] Dave_B_: there will be only one window to close
[2014-07-11 01:49:02] fly2web: then i will delete 25line.
[2014-07-11 01:49:02] Dave_B_: :) good luck!

[2014-07-11 05:12:25] jarib: it's used for :seen
[2014-07-11 05:12:27] WhereIsMySpoon: nope, im looking at the Selbot2::HELPS stuff
[2014-07-11 05:12:34] WhereIsMySpoon: thats wher eit seems to store the stuff
[2014-07-11 05:13:15] WhereIsMySpoon: so after I store the new factoid in the yaml file, Im trying to add it to HELPS
[2014-07-11 05:13:22] WhereIsMySpoon: but it doesnt seem to like wha tim doing
[2014-07-11 05:13:29] jarib: well, HELPS isn't persisted
[2014-07-11 05:13:35] jarib: if you add something to it, it will be lost on reboot
[2014-07-11 05:13:43] WhereIsMySpoon: yah thats why I have the yaml file
[2014-07-11 05:14:04] jarib: right. sounds sane
[2014-07-11 05:14:08] WhereIsMySpoon: it reads from that on startup, and when a new factoid is added, its added to the yaml file, then added to HELPS
[2014-07-11 05:14:16] WhereIsMySpoon: well...trying to be added to helps

[2014-07-11 09:08:23] ShadowXOR: people are the worst
[2014-07-11 09:08:47] asantoni: so I discovered the Selenium IDE - It's great. A QA guy doesn't have to be a programmer now
[2014-07-11 09:09:14] jimevans: asantoni: oh no. not that old chestnut again
[2014-07-11 09:09:15] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: stop
[2014-07-11 09:09:21] asantoni: I've kinda got it integrated with Bamboo now for CI though results parsing is non-existent (we'll leave that for another day)
[2014-07-11 09:09:22] asantoni: haha
[2014-07-11 09:09:23] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-11 09:09:33] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: the IDE is old, deprecated and unreliable
[2014-07-11 09:09:43] ShadowXOR: And it only works with one browser.
[2014-07-11 09:09:56] asantoni: Ok, so my question is, is it reasonable to expect that a QA person can program Selenium tests?
[2014-07-11 09:09:58] WhereIsMySpoon: hello jim :)
[2014-07-11 09:09:59] ShadowXOR: Also to be a QA this day in age as a career IMO, you need to partially be a programmer (to go anywhere).
[2014-07-11 09:10:05] jimevans: ShadowXOR: s/works/records/
[2014-07-11 09:10:10] ShadowXOR: An automation engineer, yes.  A manual tester, no.
[2014-07-11 09:10:12] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: if you are in automation QA, then yes
[2014-07-11 09:10:14] jimevans: there i fixed it for you
[2014-07-11 09:10:15] asantoni: Ok, that's what I thought ShadowXOR
[2014-07-11 09:10:30] asantoni: I'm at a company where stuff is kinda backwards (news at 11)
[2014-07-11 09:10:33] ShadowXOR: If you want to keep your career moving forward you have to do automation.
[2014-07-11 09:10:35] asantoni: or archaic, let's say
[2014-07-11 09:10:39] asantoni: yeah for sure
[2014-07-11 09:10:40] WhereIsMySpoon: if I had a pound every time someone said they were using the ide
[2014-07-11 09:10:41] ShadowXOR: Which is what I'm trying to do right now.
[2014-07-11 09:10:43] asantoni: haha
[2014-07-11 09:10:46] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd have a few more pounds

[2014-07-11 09:11:10] ShadowXOR: I've hit a professional dead-end, but luckily I've always been interested in programming so I'm having fun even if it's frustrating.
[2014-07-11 09:11:21] ShadowXOR: But yeah, you need to do tests in multiple browsers, so web driver is where it's at.
[2014-07-11 09:11:27] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: its only a dead end if you make it so
[2014-07-11 09:11:46] asantoni: Oh, I'm not using the IDE to launch the tests, I'm going to use selenium-server for that
[2014-07-11 09:11:48] WhereIsMySpoon: multiple browsers isnt really the biggest problem
[2014-07-11 09:11:56] asantoni: I'm just using them to make some very basic sanity tests right now
[2014-07-11 09:11:56] WhereIsMySpoon: its that the ide doesnt generate reliable tests
[2014-07-11 09:12:00] asantoni: ok
[2014-07-11 09:12:01] ShadowXOR: whereismyspoon: i mean i hit a professional dead end with manual testing, your salary will cap

[2014-07-11 09:12:40] WhereIsMySpoon: what is confusing
[2014-07-11 09:12:42] ShadowXOR: asantoni: yes, it is confusing, but i just went through figuring out the basics if you have a specific question on getting setup
[2014-07-11 09:12:47] ShadowXOR: to newbies like us it is :)
[2014-07-11 09:12:51] jimevans: and isn't likely to be anytime in the near future.
[2014-07-11 09:12:57] asantoni: Selenium RC IS selenium 2.0 IS the web driver!
[2014-07-11 09:13:04] WhereIsMySpoon: er...no
[2014-07-11 09:13:09] asantoni: I know
[2014-07-11 09:13:23] asantoni: Where does it say the IDE is deprecated though?
[2014-07-11 09:13:24] ShadowXOR: what programming language are you trying to use for your tests asontini?
[2014-07-11 09:13:28] asantoni: I thought the IDE was the new cool thing

[2014-07-11 09:13:50] asantoni: ShadowXOR: Well, right now I'm not trying to use any programming language. I'm using the IDE so they're saved as an HTML suite.
[2014-07-11 09:13:51] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: nope
[2014-07-11 09:13:56] asantoni: I wanted to just get stuff up and running fast
[2014-07-11 09:14:10] ShadowXOR: i'd say better to get it up and running right and expandable than fast and a dead-end
[2014-07-11 09:14:12] asantoni: I guess I can convert them to python or something
[2014-07-11 09:14:14] jimevans: okay, one last time. "selenium" is the *brand name*. "rc" and "webdriver" are APIs. "1" and "2" are version numbers.
[2014-07-11 09:14:20] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: yes you can
[2014-07-11 09:14:21] ShadowXOR: my setup has been going quite slow, but im doing it right out of the gate
[2014-07-11 09:14:30] asantoni: jimevans: That is confusing
[2014-07-11 09:14:38] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-07-11 09:14:43] ShadowXOR: asantoni: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
[2014-07-11 09:14:45] asantoni: And what's selenium-server?
[2014-07-11 09:14:54] WhereIsMySpoon: a platform to launch tests from
[2014-07-11 09:14:54] ShadowXOR: the only section you should care about is 'Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings'
[2014-07-11 09:14:55] jimevans: forgive my utter lack of sympathy.
[2014-07-11 09:14:55] ShadowXOR: on that page
[2014-07-11 09:15:10] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: what on earth is confusing about his statement
[2014-07-11 09:15:17] jimevans: you lost me at "selenium ide".

[2014-07-11 09:15:26] ato: jimevans: Got back in one piece?
[2014-07-11 09:15:33] ShadowXOR: if he has no programming experience and is a manual tester this is quite overwhelming
[2014-07-11 09:15:34] jimevans: ato: indeed i did.
[2014-07-11 09:15:35] asantoni: Why do I need to know about the RC, the web driver, APIs? I just want a thing that runs tests
[2014-07-11 09:15:40] ShadowXOR: luckily i have SOME background but it's still rough for me
[2014-07-11 09:15:46] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: *waves magic wand* oh, that didnt work
[2014-07-11 09:15:51] ShadowXOR: asantoni: don't worry about anything but the web driver IMO
[2014-07-11 09:15:55] WhereIsMySpoon: looks like I need to make tests myself
[2014-07-11 09:15:56] asantoni: Ok
[2014-07-11 09:16:02] ShadowXOR: you don't need to know what everything is
[2014-07-11 09:16:05] ShadowXOR: just what you need
[2014-07-11 09:16:10] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant magic stuff out of nothing
[2014-07-11 09:16:35] ShadowXOR: so what is everyone's preferred language binding here?
[2014-07-11 09:16:40] WhereIsMySpoon: Im using java
[2014-07-11 09:16:52] WhereIsMySpoon: thats only because everyone else at my workplace uses it
[2014-07-11 09:16:57] WhereIsMySpoon: :>
[2014-07-11 09:17:02] ShadowXOR: :3
[2014-07-11 09:17:09] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise I'd probably try ruby
[2014-07-11 09:17:18] asantoni: I thought Selenium would work like this: You download the server, you throw tests at it in any language, and then it generates parseable output that your CI server could read
[2014-07-11 09:17:28] ShadowXOR: i'm using python because it's easy, but i have interest in C# because windows and java because android.  i've done some ruby and it didn't really grab me by the cajones
[2014-07-11 09:17:35] jimevans: the "i can record all of my tests without knowing anything about programming" is a snake-oil-salesman concept that i wish i could eradicate from all human consciousness.
[2014-07-11 09:17:44] WhereIsMySpoon: heehee ^

[2014-07-11 09:17:51] asantoni: Ok fair enough
[2014-07-11 09:18:00] asantoni: So only hire QA people that can program then
[2014-07-11 09:18:03] WhereIsMySpoon: there aint no such thing as a free lunch
[2014-07-11 09:18:09] ShadowXOR: asantoni: if you want automation, yes.
[2014-07-11 09:18:11] asantoni: and program well enough to write good tests
[2014-07-11 09:18:13] asantoni: yeah
[2014-07-11 09:18:13] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: only hire *automation* qa that can program
[2014-07-11 09:18:16] asantoni: Ok
[2014-07-11 09:18:21] WhereIsMySpoon: manual qa dont need to
[2014-07-11 09:18:23] asantoni: key word there, good to know
[2014-07-11 09:18:35] asantoni: When would I pick manual QA over automation?
[2014-07-11 09:18:40] WhereIsMySpoon: asantoni: google please
[2014-07-11 09:18:43] asantoni: Besides if the target moving too fast
[2014-07-11 09:18:43] asantoni: ok
[2014-07-11 09:18:48] WhereIsMySpoon: there are approximately 3904823429040239283 articles about that
[2014-07-11 09:18:48] smyers, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-11 09:18:51] asantoni: ok fair enough
[2014-07-11 09:18:57] ShadowXOR: many things lend themselves well to automation.  many things don't
[2014-07-11 09:19:00] ShadowXOR: plus spot checking
[2014-07-11 09:19:18] asantoni: This is good, I appreciate all your insights :)
[2014-07-11 09:19:26] WhereIsMySpoon: ./afk
[2014-07-11 09:19:29] jimevans: i'll only echo what's been said. hire people who can code if you want them to automate. automation is a *software development* activity. full stop. i've never seen anyone give any argument to convince me otherwise.
[2014-07-11 09:19:56] asantoni: Ok, that's good to know too jimevans. I'll make sure we budget developer time for automated test writing then
[2014-07-11 09:20:09] jimevans: note, that's not what i said.
[2014-07-11 09:20:26] ShadowXOR: automated tests should be QA doing development
[2014-07-11 09:20:27] asantoni: oh right
[2014-07-11 09:20:29] ShadowXOR: not developers doing QA
[2014-07-11 09:20:32] asantoni: Ok
[2014-07-11 09:20:51] jimevans: there's a lot of utility in having people who are good testers writing automated tests. but the overlap of those skills can be difficult to come by.
[2014-07-11 09:20:52] ShadowXOR: they have their own testing they should be programming in like test driven development via unit tests and such
[2014-07-11 09:21:15] asantoni: jimevans: Yeah, this was the difficult situation I thought might be the case in my head
[2014-07-11 09:21:43] asantoni: Ok, thanks again guys
[2014-07-11 09:21:48] asantoni: This was all super enlightening for me
[2014-07-11 09:21:59] jimevans: we are nothing if not opinionated. :)
[2014-07-11 09:22:14] asantoni: sounds like it comes from experience :)
[2014-07-11 09:22:29] *jimevans checks the mirror for the grey in his beard.'
[2014-07-11 09:22:43] jimevans: (and sees far too much of it for his liking)
[2014-07-11 09:22:49] asantoni: I need some time to digest all of this, but again, this was really helpful and I appreciate your time!
[2014-07-11 09:22:59] asantoni: Thanks!
[2014-07-11 09:23:13] ShadowXOR: asantoni: i've been banging my head against this stuff for two+ weeks, it's a process not overnight
[2014-07-11 09:23:26] ShadowXOR: if you're implementing for the first time, unless you bring in consultants
[2014-07-11 09:24:13] WhereIsMySpoon: I write all our selenium tests and I develop on the system that they are for...
[2014-07-11 09:24:25] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont see anything wrong with devs writing tests
[2014-07-11 09:24:26] ShadowXOR: but you're a unique snowflake
[2014-07-11 09:24:31] WhereIsMySpoon: >_>
[2014-07-11 09:24:39] ShadowXOR: generally both dev and QA should be writing tests, just different types
[2014-07-11 09:24:39] WhereIsMySpoon: no need to be rude
[2014-07-11 09:24:50] WhereIsMySpoon: we dont have qa :P
[2014-07-11 09:24:53] WhereIsMySpoon: small company
[2014-07-11 09:24:56] ShadowXOR: how small?
[2014-07-11 09:25:09] ShadowXOR: i'm in a 'small' company and we have 4 QA but it's all relative lol
[2014-07-11 09:25:09] WhereIsMySpoon: on my team there are 3 people
[2014-07-11 09:25:29] ShadowXOR: having no QA makes me sad
[2014-07-11 09:25:31] WhereIsMySpoon: that work on the system
[2014-07-11 09:25:40] ShadowXOR: depends on your product though
[2014-07-11 09:25:43] ShadowXOR: everything we make is software
[2014-07-11 09:25:49] ShadowXOR: that goes to a customer base

[2014-07-11 11:12:16] ShadowXOR: i have my enter_username, enter_password, go_to, and sign in functions, should i turn those all into one generic 'service' function that performs all of them doing a login_success and login _failure
[2014-07-11 11:12:26] ShadowXOR: or should i keep those methods and turn them into the respective login_success and login_failure

[2014-07-11 11:18:24] smccarthy: ShadowXOR: I think it could be preference. I have each as separate and also include those seperate ones inside login_success and login_failure. Just incase I want a test that only enters username or only enters password, without clicking Submit
[2014-07-11 11:20:09] ShadowXOR: interesting
[2014-07-11 11:20:25] ShadowXOR: i think the approach of splitting them up is slightly more complex but more forward thinking
[2014-07-11 11:20:32] ShadowXOR: and it breaks it down easier to refactor later i think
[2014-07-11 11:20:41] ShadowXOR: makes it semi-self documenting with each item broken down

[2014-07-11 12:29:17] AutomatedTester: ato: better than what is in Marionette?
[2014-07-11 12:29:29] ato: I've never used Marionette's screenshot capabilities.
[2014-07-11 12:29:53] AutomatedTester: ok... so lets back up, why do you think this is what we want then?
[2014-07-11 12:30:09] ato: I don't know what Marionette is doing here.
[2014-07-11 12:30:36] ato: I'm suggesting it might be interesting to look at the algorithm to see if it can be transposed in to the spec.
[2014-07-11 12:31:12] AutomatedTester: ok, I don't think we want to describe the full implementation here
[2014-07-11 12:31:57] ato: There's a fine line between what we can define because different browsers will implement this differently.

[2014-07-11 12:32:29] ato: But we need to define what constraints the screenshot should be taken under.
[2014-07-11 12:32:44] AutomatedTester: we can say, it should take the DOM and create an image which can then be passed back over the wire
[2014-07-11 12:33:47] AutomatedTester: looks like devtools does something like what Marionette does

[2014-07-11 12:36:20] ato: Right, and you feel saying that will prevent UA's from for example stitching?

[2014-07-11 12:37:01] AutomatedTester: ato: no, it gives them the freedom to do stitching
[2014-07-11 12:37:23] AutomatedTester: like the Chromium team, they don't want to do it via canvas
[2014-07-11 12:37:53] ato: If they stitch by scrolling the document, the DOM might grow.
[2014-07-11 12:38:29] AutomatedTester: right, so we need to specify that it is the DOM state at the time of the call
[2014-07-11 12:39:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans: could IE do screenshots by dumping things in a canvas and then getting the data uri from the canvas?
[2014-07-11 12:40:34] ato: AutomatedTester: Exactly, I'm just not sure how to define that when we can use mutation events.
[2014-07-11 12:40:43] ato: can't*
[2014-07-11 12:41:21] ato: Because it's not like we can serialize or hash the DOM.

[2014-07-11 12:49:26] AutomatedTester: also it doesnt screenshot things like position:fixed nicely
[2014-07-11 12:49:59] AutomatedTester: since the screenshot will have it roughly at the bottom of the viewport not the document
[2014-07-11 12:50:09] ato: Well I think it might depend on a UA's internal representation of the painting canvas.
[2014-07-11 12:50:20] ModusPwnens: Is there a way to somehow construct a list of actions where the action only knows about the operation to perform and the element to be performed on?
[2014-07-11 12:50:24] jimevans: yeah, that's not going to work for IE. MSFT has repeatedly maintained that it isolates the browser from the OS, so no way to specify a window to draw from.
[2014-07-11 12:51:09] ato: AFAIU Gecko has this abstract concept of a nsRect, which is essentially a framebuffer.  That's later dumped via Cairo to Xlib (in the case of Linux) or Cocoa on Mac.
[2014-07-11 12:51:33] ModusPwnens: it seems like the only way to create an action is to specify the driver or some sort of interface
[2014-07-11 12:52:20] jimevans: ModusPwnens: what's the issue? i'm not sure i follow.

[2014-07-11 12:54:07] ModusPwnens_: I'm not quite sure how to explain it better. I want to create an action that only has the action to be performed (e.g. click, hover, etc) and the element to perform that action on (via selector or whatever)
[2014-07-11 12:54:40] jimevans: sounds like you want a set of wrapper routines.
[2014-07-11 12:55:09] ModusPwnens_: The reason for this is that the driver is not really available at the same time I want to create the actions
[2014-07-11 12:55:27] ModusPwnens_: but although the driver is not available, I do know what i want the driver to do when it becomes available

[2014-07-11 13:22:48] ModusPwnens_: its because this library is stupid
[2014-07-11 13:23:41] ModusPwnens_: and the reason i have to do it this way is because we create one action for multiple test environments, and the action holds the executor. The executor is reused for different test environments and so the executor gets all the different drivers but the action object does not
