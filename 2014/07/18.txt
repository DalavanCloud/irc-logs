[2014-07-18 05:00:15] WhereIsMySpoon: anything you can do with the IDE, you can do better with properly coded tests

[2014-07-18 05:11:41] nofear: and every time when it change i must update the test cript
[2014-07-18 05:11:48] nofear: yes

[2014-07-18 08:25:42] WhereIsMySpoon: lol lukeis :D
[2014-07-18 08:26:07] WhereIsMySpoon: ponch_: to actually make the select element render its list of elements? or to click a sub element and submit it as part of a form?
[2014-07-18 08:27:45] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont see why you need to be able to click the select2 element unless your test case is to be able to visually confirm that the list it provides renders
[2014-07-18 08:28:35] ponch_: well the actual test case is pretty complicated my app has things called task triggers that should assign the next task to a user once the task with the task trigger is marked complete so the dropdown box in question is to assign a task a task trigger so task 1 points to task 55 or something like that so i'm trying to automate the tests ( ovi ) and add a new task trigger to a task - i have successfully used selenium to do all of the buildin
[2014-07-18 08:28:51] ponch_: my goal is to get the test case to act like the user.
[2014-07-18 08:29:02] ponch_: the user would have to click the box select task blah blah whatever
[2014-07-18 08:29:05] ponch_: and then click submit
[2014-07-18 08:29:20] WhereIsMySpoon: so your actual need is for the select2 to have the specified option element selected
[2014-07-18 08:29:28] ponch_: then i wanted to have the user go mark the other task as done and see if the next task is put in_progress
[2014-07-18 08:29:48] ponch_: yes but i wanted to do tht by having it click and pick like a user would
[2014-07-18 08:30:02] WhereIsMySpoon: that isnt how selects are handled in selenium afaik
[2014-07-18 08:30:05] ponch_: is it just smarter to go backdoor and say select2 you lazzy mofo here is what youre going to do
[2014-07-18 08:30:16] ponch_: alright how are the handled
[2014-07-18 08:30:17] WhereIsMySpoon: you handle selects by using a Select object

[2014-07-18 08:49:18] ponch_: use
[2014-07-18 08:50:22] WhereIsMySpoon: ponch_: i use eclipse, but i develop in java
[2014-07-18 08:50:25] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-07-18 08:50:53] WhereIsMySpoon: that wont really help you i guess
[2014-07-18 08:50:54] ponch_: eclipse is nice i use netbeans for java but we use sublime2 for our editing

[2014-07-18 08:51:11] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-07-18 08:51:15] lukeis: debugging tools? meh… debugging steps? yes…. first really make sure you're clicking on the element you think you're clicking on ;)  (like by changing it's border to solid red 3px)
[2014-07-18 08:51:21] cuke_dude, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-18 08:51:42] ponch_: so what i did is i did like a wait until driver find element .displayed

[2014-07-18 08:52:18] ponch_: well i added a name tag to the html
[2014-07-18 08:52:25] ponch_: and named it add_task which is unique
[2014-07-18 08:52:47] *lukeis doesn't want to repeat the question ;)'

[2014-07-18 08:54:41] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-07-18 08:54:45] WhereIsMySpoon: yes whats up biswa
[2014-07-18 08:55:26] biswa: dude , i tried for .build and .perform in script just now
[2014-07-18 08:55:39] ponch_: eh i read it i would say it was more or less sscce i didn't have my pastebin ready but i had concise code to share and a brief explination of the problem
[2014-07-18 08:55:39] WhereIsMySpoon: ponch_: so you're saying it gets to     @wait.until{ @driver.find_element(:name, "testing variable should not find") } but it doesnt click teh thing you told it to?
[2014-07-18 08:55:43] biswa: Actions act = new Actions (d1);
[2014-07-18 08:55:44] biswa: act.moveToElement(Products).moveToElement(Cards).perform();

[2014-07-18 08:56:28] biswa: if u will seee my 2nd line of code , there i have not used .build , still it is working
[2014-07-18 08:56:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ponch_: I still suspect that it isnt really clickign the thing you think it is, and is finding something eslle to click
[2014-07-18 08:56:37] WhereIsMySpoon: *typing
[2014-07-18 08:56:42] ponch_: WhereIsMySpoon: no i put that in so it would pause while i looked around the line or 2 before that should have clicked the link but does not which is why i added in that line to see what was going on-- i added the second click line to see if that would hellp
[2014-07-18 08:56:52] ponch_: alright ill try using an id
[2014-07-18 08:57:01] ponch_: and making it a string of nonsense numbers
[2014-07-18 08:57:07] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds like a good idea
[2014-07-18 08:57:37] WhereIsMySpoon: biswa: so your code works?
[2014-07-18 08:57:40] WhereIsMySpoon: whats the issue
[2014-07-18 08:57:44] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused
[2014-07-18 08:58:20] biswa: i mean , without using .build() , my code is working then what is the use of build()
[2014-07-18 08:58:35] biswa: where i need to use this ?
[2014-07-18 08:58:36] cuke_dude_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-18 08:58:57] jimevans: biswa: the idea behind build() is so you can use the same action chain over and over again.
[2014-07-18 08:59:19] jimevans: originally, it was required, but has been superseded by perform().
[2014-07-18 08:59:35] WhereIsMySpoon: So you can do Actions a = new Actions(driver); a = a.doSomething().doSomethingElse().build();
[2014-07-18 08:59:47] WhereIsMySpoon: then reuse a.perform() multiple times

[2014-07-18 12:33:59] dude-x: cgoldberg: that seems cool if you need code type fixtures, but this is more about having a "catalog" of documents that will go into mongo db. if we want to a create a snapshot of the database, we would still need some way to specify the things we want to put in the database

[2014-07-18 12:38:32] cgoldberg: yea
[2014-07-18 12:39:29] cgoldberg: but if you need any setup before a test's setUp runs, this is a generic way to do it (like populating a db for example)
[2014-07-18 12:40:15] dude-x: cgoldberg: we are using py.test so it's easy to create a fixture function, but we need to have code to read a catalog, transform it into mongo BSON and then insert it into a DB
[2014-07-18 12:40:43] cgoldberg: gotcha.  i don't use py.test, so this is how I do fixtures
[2014-07-18 12:41:30] cgoldberg: dude-x, i use testtools mostly, as my framework and testing lib.  It's really nice
[2014-07-18 12:41:52] dude-x: does testtools make it easy to run tests in paralell?
[2014-07-18 12:42:00] cgoldberg: and there are lots of affiliated libs by the same authors

[2014-07-18 12:42:41] cgoldberg: dude-x, it provides part of the funtionality to do parallelization, but you have to implement some complex code to get it all working.  but I have a simple example if you wanna grab my code?
[2014-07-18 12:43:32] dude-x: cgoldberg: not at the moment, py.test has pytest-xdist for parallelization; i use that to run tests on sauce
[2014-07-18 12:44:05] smyers: cgoldberg, I'm interested in your example :)
[2014-07-18 12:44:18] cgoldberg: dude-x, is it local parallelization (for multi-core)? or distributed on multiple machines?
[2014-07-18 12:44:25] smyers: I ended up having to reimplement a custom xdist because it doesn't have enough hooks for what I needed...
[2014-07-18 12:44:35] smyers: Hoping to get my dirty hacks back upstream soon
[2014-07-18 12:44:53] cgoldberg: smyers, check this out: https://github.com/cgoldberg/concurrencytest
[2014-07-18 12:45:05] cgoldberg: smyers, and this post:  http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2013/06/python-concurrencytest-running.html
[2014-07-18 12:45:08] dude-x: cgoldberg: py.test lets you push to several machines, it lets you run multiple processes; for sauce i use the -n 6 --boxed option, it creates 6 subprocesses
[2014-07-18 12:45:26] cgoldberg: dude-x, thats cool.  mine just does local concurrency
[2014-07-18 12:45:45] cgoldberg: so good for parallelizing cpu-bound tests
[2014-07-18 12:46:25] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-18 12:46:58] smyers: I also made a particularly silly thing that lets you use docker images running selenium server so each test child gets its own selenium env...
[2014-07-18 12:47:30] smyers: The amount of heat we generate just to test a web UI is awesome.
[2014-07-18 12:47:32] cgoldberg: smyers, i've done similar, but with LXC containers running Ubuntu
[2014-07-18 12:47:57] cuke_dude, quitting. (Quit: cuke_dude)
[2014-07-18 12:48:05] cgoldberg: so it deploys the env, and runs tests (including some web ui stuff)
[2014-07-18 12:49:28] cgoldberg: smyers, dude-x, ever used subunit?  it's in the testtools family also... It's a streaming binary format for test results... awesome stuff
[2014-07-18 12:49:47] *smyers is a py.test whore, so unlikely'
[2014-07-18 12:49:58] AutomatedTester: smyers: ++
[2014-07-18 12:50:25] dude-x: i want to use docker in the future but for now i envision it's more the webservers that we test
[2014-07-18 12:50:26] cgoldberg: im entrenched in unittest/testools/subunit
[2014-07-18 12:50:29] smyers: Still good to see other impls, though, so I can steal from the best
[2014-07-18 12:50:40] smyers: Or the worst. I'm not picky.
[2014-07-18 12:51:05] smyers: I think py.test can just eat your unittest-lookin' suite right up with minimal (or no) migration pain
[2014-07-18 12:51:26] dude-x: yeah py.test is unittest compatible
[2014-07-18 12:51:37] cgoldberg: smyers, you couldn't fathom the number of testools tests we have that go beyond simple unittest
[2014-07-18 12:51:45] smyers: Oh, sure I can.
[2014-07-18 12:51:52] cgoldberg: i'd guess hundreds of thousands at least
[2014-07-18 12:52:33] cgoldberg: would be a hell of a migration
[2014-07-18 12:53:07] cgoldberg: testtools is also unittest compatibloe.. but we've used so many features that it would be a tough sell to move to py.test
[2014-07-18 12:54:20] cgoldberg: however, I love tox... and that comes from py.test basically... holger's code
