[2014-07-16 04:13:03] rananda: hi Biswajit
[2014-07-16 04:13:21] rananda: post it
[2014-07-16 04:14:25] Biswajit: these are all interview qustions , what i am facing now days
[2014-07-16 04:14:41] Biswajit: what are Different types of exception provided by Selenium/WebDriver?
[2014-07-16 04:14:49] WhereIsMySpoon: :docs
[2014-07-16 04:14:56] WhereIsMySpoon: :api
[2014-07-16 04:14:56] selbot2: .NET: http://goo.gl/lvxok | Java: http://goo.gl/Wvl4G | Ruby: http://goo.gl/ue5sM | Python: http://goo.gl/sCwQ3s | Javascript: http://goo.gl/9aYaOG
[2014-07-16 04:15:12] rananda: Biswajit, i think you already got the answer :)
[2014-07-16 04:16:06] rananda: you can find the answers in these docs
[2014-07-16 04:16:26] Biswajit: ok , nut these are jave exceptions or selenium exceptions ?
[2014-07-16 04:16:33] Biswajit: *but
[2014-07-16 04:16:35] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-07-16 04:16:55] WhereIsMySpoon: Biswajit: selenium is a framework on top of which bindings for languages are built
[2014-07-16 04:17:14] WhereIsMySpoon: these languages include java
[2014-07-16 04:17:35] WhereIsMySpoon: all of the exceptions from the java bindings will ofc be java exceptions
[2014-07-16 04:18:03] Shardvexz, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-16 04:18:16] rananda: most part it can be integrated with any language and you can use the those exception handlings as well
[2014-07-16 04:18:18] WhereIsMySpoon: Biswajit: asking "are these java or selenium execptions" is like asking "is this apple a fruit or flying?"
[2014-07-16 04:18:31] Biswajit: my interviewer asked like "element not found" is a selenium exception like this any others ?
[2014-07-16 04:19:38] rananda: Biswajit, I would suggest you to go thru the documentation to get more precise answers which you are looking out
[2014-07-16 04:19:51] WhereIsMySpoon: if you look at the docs, you will see there is a NoSuchElementException
[2014-07-16 04:19:59] Biswajit: ok thanks , will go through that
[2014-07-16 04:20:24] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea if you want answers to stuff related to the bindings or docs, go through the docs
[2014-07-16 04:20:37] rananda: Biswajit, the reason being there is list of the exceptions and usage details as well
[2014-07-16 04:20:48] Biswajit: fine

[2014-07-16 04:21:00] Biswajit: one more question : What setting required to run Scripts in IE Browser?
[2014-07-16 04:21:09] WhereIsMySpoon: what sort of scripts
[2014-07-16 04:21:17] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium has JS enabled by default
[2014-07-16 04:21:27] WhereIsMySpoon: so any scripts that are part of your onload will load by default
[2014-07-16 04:21:58] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to run some js separate to that, selenium provides the JavascriptExecutor class for java, and similar classes for the other bindings
[2014-07-16 04:22:05] WhereIsMySpoon: this can send js to the browser
[2014-07-16 04:22:32] Biswajit: thanks a lot
[2014-07-16 04:22:45] patrick99e99, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-16 04:22:47] Biswajit: one more :In IE finding elements by CSS is better or Xpath?
[2014-07-16 04:23:14] WhereIsMySpoon: usually css, but "better" is a subjective term
[2014-07-16 04:24:02] Biswajit: in terms of Performance
[2014-07-16 04:24:25] WhereIsMySpoon: I imagine that depends too
[2014-07-16 04:24:27] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont know
[2014-07-16 04:24:29] WhereIsMySpoon: google it
[2014-07-16 04:24:55] Biswajit: okay
[2014-07-16 04:25:51] Biswajit: i want to clear the text from a textarea without using .clear() and Sendkeys(Keys.Control +"a")

[2014-07-16 04:26:35] WhereIsMySpoon: thats a really stupid way to do it

[2014-07-16 15:34:16] Zoddie: phasze: simply put, I would like for the other user on his pc to take advantage of this automation. It's a bit advanced for me to setup a server for all node/clients to run off of (which is what i think the grid2 thing is intending?)
[2014-07-16 15:34:35] Zoddie: but i currently run the selenium automation code direct from eclipse junit run
[2014-07-16 15:34:52] phasze: Zoddie: Yeah, I thought you wanted a system set up to easily run tests against.
[2014-07-16 15:34:54] Zoddie: just trying to figure the simplest way to package, send, and grant operation
[2014-07-16 15:35:00] phasze: but you just want to share your tests with others to run
[2014-07-16 15:35:05] Zoddie: correct
[2014-07-16 15:36:05] phasze: I imagine the easiest way for you would be to be to have them set up eclipse and junit run like you do.
[2014-07-16 15:36:21] Zoddie: Would it be required for him to have eclipse, configure it for Selenium IDE and junit testing, open my .java in his eclipse and hit run with his firefox prepared with selenium ide as well?
[2014-07-16 15:36:32] Zoddie: or is there a simpler way to package, configure and run

[2014-07-16 15:38:20] phasze: Zoddie: I'm not completely familiar with junit but I imagine you could just give him a .jar file to run the test.
