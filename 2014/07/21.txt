[2014-07-21 04:25:21] johnny_b: firefox - OK, phantomjs - :((
[2014-07-21 04:26:02] johnny_b: and i have no idea what's wrong
[2014-07-21 04:26:32] bl4ckscor3: devs from selenium aren't in here, are they?
[2014-07-21 04:26:41] jimevans: some are.
[2014-07-21 04:27:07] bl4ckscor3: why not ask them? :DD
[2014-07-21 04:27:20] jimevans: but unless you can provide a sample page that's giving you trouble, it's not likely they'll be able to help much.
[2014-07-21 04:27:33] jimevans: also, do your users browse your site using phantomjs?
[2014-07-21 04:27:43] bl4ckscor3: no users
[2014-07-21 04:27:46] jimevans: (hint: the answer is always going to be "no")
[2014-07-21 04:27:47] bl4ckscor3: it's for an irc bot
[2014-07-21 04:28:07] bl4ckscor3: and he's hosted on a vps
[2014-07-21 04:28:20] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: then why bother using webdriver in the first place?
[2014-07-21 04:28:20] bl4ckscor3: no firefox installed there
[2014-07-21 04:28:36] bl4ckscor3: well what wuold the other way be
[2014-07-21 04:28:44] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-21 04:28:47] jimevans: simply use phantomjs itself.

[2014-07-21 04:29:54] bl4ckscor3: well
[2014-07-21 04:30:03] jimevans: virtually all of the examples from the phantomjs project do that.

[2014-07-21 04:33:56] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-21 04:34:49] jimevans: what do you "need a 2 second delay" for?
[2014-07-21 04:35:38] jimevans: or, more succinctly, where do you think you require the delay?
[2014-07-21 04:35:52] johnny_b: jimevans: probably the easiest way to use phantomjs with python is via selenium
[2014-07-21 04:36:19] bl4ckscor3: the page needs a little time to show the "destination-link" and selenium is too fast for that
[2014-07-21 04:36:35] jimevans: johnny_b: if you're dead-set on only using python, and not using phantomjs's native language to manipulate it (javascript), then sure.
[2014-07-21 04:36:35] bl4ckscor3: it tries to search the second cssSelector before it even shows up
[2014-07-21 04:37:17] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: why aren't you using a webdriverwait?
[2014-07-21 04:37:21] johnny_b: jimevans: ok
[2014-07-21 04:37:24] jimevans: that's exactly what it's designed to do

[2014-07-21 04:39:51] johnny_b: jimevans: my problem : when i log into FB i see nothing just the bare menu which isn't working. it looks if it was javascript disabled
[2014-07-21 04:40:59] jimevans: johnny_b: what are you trying to automate?
[2014-07-21 04:41:25] jimevans: sorry, are you trying to automate facebook itself, or something else that perhaps relies on facebook authentication?

[2014-07-21 04:42:53] jimevans: s/every/ever/
[2014-07-21 04:44:48] bl4ckscor3: jimevans, do i just need to make a new webdriverwait object, or do i have to do more?
[2014-07-21 04:44:57] jimevans: the point i'm trying to make is that so-called "headless" testing is of dubious value.
[2014-07-21 04:45:42] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp
[2014-07-21 04:47:37] johnny_b: i see no frame but everything is loaded with javascript
[2014-07-21 04:49:04] jimevans: johnny_b: making sure i understand. your code works fine with firefox/chrome/IE ("real browsers"), but fails in phantomjs?
[2014-07-21 04:49:14] johnny_b: exactly
[2014-07-21 04:49:55] jimevans: johnny_b: i ask about frames, because perhaps phantomjs has issues with cross-domain frames.
[2014-07-21 04:50:03] jimevans: i don't know
[2014-07-21 04:50:46] jimevans: it wouldn't surprise me. cross-domain frames is a real pain to try to deal with in browser automation. the browsers' javascript engines do their level best to prevent you from doing it.
[2014-07-21 04:50:58] jimevans: (for obvious security-related reasons)
[2014-07-21 04:51:10] johnny_b: i see
[2014-07-21 04:51:38] jimevans: and again (for the third time), i ask, "will your users ever browser your site/use your application using phantomjs?"
[2014-07-21 04:53:12] jimevans: i ask the question to make the point that if you're testing your application using other browsers, what's the motivation for wanting to use phantomjs?
[2014-07-21 04:53:46] jimevans: so-called "headless" testing is not demonstrably more performant (faster) than testing in visible browsers, at least not in all cases.
[2014-07-21 04:54:12] jimevans: with phantomjs, you'll be using a browser that is entirely unlike any other browser being used.
[2014-07-21 04:54:36] jimevans: (remember, chrome is no longer based off webkit; safari doesn't use phantomjs's javascript engine)
[2014-07-21 04:55:39] johnny_b: jimevans: thanks for the clarification
[2014-07-21 04:55:54] johnny_b: i think i'll stick with using ff
[2014-07-21 04:55:55] jimevans: if your answer is, "i want to avoid putting a browser in my ci environment nodes," you can make that case, but i personally think that's Doing It Wrong (TM)
[2014-07-21 04:57:14] jimevans: don't get me wrong, i love phantomjs. i think it's a great project. it's just not always the best fit for automated testing like this, particularly when you hit an edge case where it doesn't work.

[2014-07-21 06:11:48] bl4ckscor3: jimevans, de-ads, i used the scheduled worker service to let selenium wait, you asked why i didnt use webdriverwait
[2014-07-21 06:12:35] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: you'll need to post your current code for me to be able to analyze it at all.
[2014-07-21 06:12:54] bl4ckscor3: one sec
[2014-07-21 06:13:23] jimevans: and still no guarantees i'll be able to offer any advice. i've got "real" (read: paid) work i need to get to.

[2014-07-21 06:26:23] jimevans: HtmlUnit's javascript support is notoriously spotty.
[2014-07-21 06:26:33] jimevans: what happens when you use, say, firefox?
[2014-07-21 06:26:36] jimevans: or chrome?

[2014-07-21 06:26:56] bl4ckscor3: well i tried it with firefox but one sec let me try it again with webdriverwait
[2014-07-21 06:26:57] jimevans: in other words, HtmlUnit isn't likely to be the best choice here.

[2014-07-21 06:34:18] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: "5 second delay" == thread.sleep(5000)?
[2014-07-21 06:34:24] bl4ckscor3: no
[2014-07-21 06:34:28] bl4ckscor3: using webdriverwait
[2014-07-21 06:34:29] jimevans: or using webdriverwait?
[2014-07-21 06:34:31] jimevans: good.
[2014-07-21 06:34:40] jimevans: then as far as i'm concerned, it works properly.
[2014-07-21 06:34:41] jimevans: :)
[2014-07-21 06:35:33] jimevans: htmlunit works entirely unlike any other browser. it's javascript support is spotty at best. it cannot be guaranteed to produce the same DOM as any of the existing layout engines.
[2014-07-21 06:35:35] bl4ckscor3: yes it does, but the owner of the vps doesnt want ff installed
[2014-07-21 06:35:48] jimevans: tfb
[2014-07-21 06:35:55] bl4ckscor3: ?
[2014-07-21 06:36:07] jimevans: too f*** bad.
[2014-07-21 06:36:20] bl4ckscor3: lel
[2014-07-21 06:36:32] jimevans: you can try phantomjs, if "not having a UI" is an absolute requirement.
[2014-07-21 06:36:53] bl4ckscor3: i wanted to buy my own one anyways, so is there a way to close the opened "firefox windows" again?
[2014-07-21 06:37:05] jimevans: but then, if you're going to be running this using one (and only one) browser, i think you're using the wrong tool for the job.

[2014-07-21 07:56:22] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: curious to hear your thoughts on using phantomjs because I dont want a browser (and cant have a browser) on my CI envs
[2014-07-21 07:56:29] WhereIsMySpoon: is this a good excuse
[2014-07-21 07:56:48] Dave_B_: can't have a browser on your CI? Seems unlikely
[2014-07-21 07:56:53] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: quick question, how many users are using headless browsers to use your site?
[2014-07-21 07:56:54] WhereIsMySpoon: theyre headless
[2014-07-21 07:56:58] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: 0
[2014-07-21 07:57:14] Dave_B_: my CI server is headless too, I still use FF
[2014-07-21 07:57:27] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: but then again, none of them are using ff or chrome either
[2014-07-21 07:57:33] WhereIsMySpoon: and IE doesnt work on linux
[2014-07-21 07:57:35] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-07-21 07:57:49] AutomatedTester: wow... rock > WhereIsMySpoon > hardplace
[2014-07-21 07:58:05] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i love phantomjs. i think it's a great project. it's amazing that they've baked webdriver support into their project. having said that, what browsers are you testing against? if you're not testing against the browsers your users are using, you're Doing It Wrong (TM).
[2014-07-21 07:58:06] AutomatedTester: so phantomjs won't protect you imho
[2014-07-21 07:58:22] WhereIsMySpoon: the point is that Im doing very very core smoke tests
[2014-07-21 07:58:29] WhereIsMySpoon: they shouldnt matter wrt browsers
[2014-07-21 07:58:39] jimevans: key word: shouldn't
[2014-07-21 07:58:42] WhereIsMySpoon: not "they shouldnt" I mean actually according to the spec
[2014-07-21 07:58:44] AutomatedTester: so there is no JS on those pages etc?
[2014-07-21 07:58:55] WhereIsMySpoon: there is plenty
[2014-07-21 07:59:20] Dave_B_: try to convince your company to run a few weak VMs which you can use to run a grid of IE nodes?
[2014-07-21 07:59:22] WhereIsMySpoon: we have a plethora of js everywhere
[2014-07-21 07:59:30] AutomatedTester: phantomjs uses an old JS engine that is < ES5 iirc
[2014-07-21 07:59:54] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: our infra guy is against setting up an IE node for core functionality testing
[2014-07-21 08:00:07] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: what kind of confidence do you have that running against phantomjs in any way correlates to the behavior you'll see when running against the browser your users are actually using?
[2014-07-21 08:00:08] WhereIsMySpoon: the point of smoke tests is that they are "embarrasment" testgs
[2014-07-21 08:00:12] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-21 08:00:21] WhereIsMySpoon: the functionality should work regardless of where I test them
[2014-07-21 08:00:26] jimevans: i just want to point out you're taking a risk
[2014-07-21 08:00:37] jimevans: if you're comfortable with that risk, be my guest.
[2014-07-21 08:01:17] AutomatedTester: Webkit != Trident
[2014-07-21 08:01:37] AutomatedTester: JSCore != Chakra
[2014-07-21 08:02:05] *WhereIsMySpoon doesnt know what trident jscore and chakra are'
[2014-07-21 08:02:06] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 784
[2014-07-21 08:03:04] jimevans: there are, imho, two arguments you can make relying on so-called "headless" testing. one is, "it's faster," but that's not necessarily the case. the other is, "i don't want to install <whatever> browser in my environment," which may be valid, but does involve some risk.
[2014-07-21 08:03:22] WhereIsMySpoon: faster isnt in the equation
[2014-07-21 08:03:52] jimevans: trident == IE's rendering engine. chakra == IE's javascript engine. jscore == the javascript engine used by phantomjs.
[2014-07-21 08:04:23] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-21 08:04:25] AutomatedTester: and its an old JSCore
[2014-07-21 08:04:28] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-07-21 08:04:58] jimevans: yes, it's an old jscore. phantomjs 2.0 (in development) will update those components considerably.
[2014-07-21 08:05:24] AutomatedTester: so my point is that what may work in IE10 may not work in phantomjs
[2014-07-21 08:05:29] AutomatedTester: and vice versa
[2014-07-21 08:05:37] jimevans: AutomatedTester: +1
[2014-07-21 08:05:52] AutomatedTester: because IE are hot on following the spec
[2014-07-21 08:06:01] AutomatedTester: webkit folks not so much
[2014-07-21 08:06:24] jimevans: this is particularly true if you're not very very careful about doctypes in your html.

[2014-07-21 08:07:15] jimevans: so you're not expecting anything related to any web standards whatsoever.
[2014-07-21 08:07:18] WhereIsMySpoon: quite
[2014-07-21 08:07:35] *AutomatedTester goes to get WhereIsMySpoon a stetson... and some spurs'
[2014-07-21 08:07:36] jimevans: then testing using a webkit-based browser is doubly crazy.
[2014-07-21 08:07:41] WhereIsMySpoon: hey not so long ago it was ie6...about 2 years ago
[2014-07-21 08:07:51] WhereIsMySpoon: luckily i wasnt here for that
[2014-07-21 08:08:06] jimevans: so let me get this straight.
[2014-07-21 08:08:39] WhereIsMySpoon: there are still a fair few iframes hanging about...
[2014-07-21 08:08:48] *WhereIsMySpoon hates iframes'
[2014-07-21 08:10:01] jimevans: you're testing using phantomjs because whatever, and you expect the types of tests you're running won't matter cross-browser because they're "so simple" and "standard", and a webkit-based browser (phantomjs) will let you do that, following standards to get you there. yet the actual platform you care about (IE8) does very very little standard conformance, so you're blindly hoping that your smoke tests will work against the non-standard platform. do i ha
[2014-07-21 08:10:26] WhereIsMySpoon: I personally want the tests to run on IE
[2014-07-21 08:10:38] WhereIsMySpoon: because thats our target browser
[2014-07-21 08:10:50] WhereIsMySpoon: but yes you have that right
[2014-07-21 08:10:56] jimevans: okay.

[2014-07-21 08:12:13] WhereIsMySpoon: well this automated testing is new :)
[2014-07-21 08:12:23] WhereIsMySpoon: didnt even have any a few months ago
[2014-07-21 08:12:38] WhereIsMySpoon: well...we still dont have any thats built into our ci yet
[2014-07-21 08:13:08] jimevans: if i were in your shoes, i'd raise a big ol' honkin' red flag, saying, "these tests are supposed to catch the egregious 'embarrassment' failures, but because of your reluctance to actually invest in the testing, there's a non-zero probability that one or more of that class of failure will get through."
[2014-07-21 08:14:14] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-07-21 08:16:14] jimevans: (all couched, of course, in the "corporate-speak" communication style appropriate to your organization)
[2014-07-21 08:16:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: non-zero probability is too nice
[2014-07-21 08:16:41] AutomatedTester: there is a probability of 1 that at least one of these issues will be missed
[2014-07-21 08:17:22] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i dunno. they *might* be the luckiest organization in the history of computer science.'
[2014-07-21 08:17:31] jimevans: :)

[2014-07-21 12:14:29] detronizator: jleyba: hi. I have got a couple of very weird questions for you about Node selenium-webdriver.
[2014-07-21 12:14:43] detronizator: 1) is it using the remote-debugger interface?
[2014-07-21 12:15:07] detronizator: it seems to, and it seems to make it impossible for any other extension to use chrome.debugger.attach
[2014-07-21 12:15:29] detronizator: 2) do you know if 2 clients can connect to the remote-debugger interface at the same time?
[2014-07-21 12:16:14] jleyba: 1) selenium-webdriver is just a client library. ChromeDriver itself uses the debugger interface
[2014-07-21 12:16:33] detronizator: yep, that actually makes sense
[2014-07-21 12:17:04] SitamJana, quitting. (Quit: SitamJana)
[2014-07-21 12:17:48] detronizator: what about 2) jleyba?
[2014-07-21 12:17:55] detronizator: you probably have never tried...
[2014-07-21 12:18:07] jleyba: I'm not sure
[2014-07-21 12:18:30] jleyba: I know weird things happen if you try to open the dev console in Chrome when running with ChromeDriver
[2014-07-21 12:18:50] detronizator: yeah... the driver seems to hang
[2014-07-21 12:18:56] detronizator: that leads me to 3)
[2014-07-21 12:19:15] detronizator: 3) I have noticed that the selenium-webdriver api do "sometimes" use of "promise"
[2014-07-21 12:19:33] jleyba: s/sometimes/almost always/
[2014-07-21 12:19:58] detronizator: ah... so, in theory we should always have a ".then()"
[2014-07-21 12:20:12] detronizator: the examples seem to indicate that some actions are synchronous
[2014-07-21 12:20:29] jleyba: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Control_Flows
[2014-07-21 12:20:49] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-21 12:20:53] jleyba: There's a promise manager behind the scenes that tracks commands so you don't have to write so many callbacks
[2014-07-21 12:21:09] detronizator: gotcha! that's why it "feels" synchronous
[2014-07-21 12:21:16] detronizator: good idea using that
[2014-07-21 12:21:20] jleyba: And the next release will have harmony generator support

[2014-07-21 12:29:27] detronizator: jleyba: last question - do you know who could give me an answer about chrome-driver sort of "taking ownership" of the chrome.debugger interface?

[2014-07-21 13:47:07] joesmith: jimevans: would it make more sense just to use an xpath to find the element?
[2014-07-21 13:47:43] jimevans: probably. i dunno. i don't have access to the actual html, nor the time to investigate it thoroughly if i did.

[2014-07-21 13:59:08] jimevans: but wtf do i know
[2014-07-21 13:59:59] joesmith: jimevans: does that mean you prefer to write browser-specific if's a lot?

[2014-07-21 14:03:45] jimevans: so, yes, though xpath should die by fire after having been nuked from orbit, this is one case i'd probably use it instead of css selectors until i could rid myself of browsers that don't support it. otherwise, you're injecting sizzle for every. single. call. which seems unnecessary and inelegant.

[2014-07-21 15:31:05] lukeis: depending on server the url may need to be  "/wd/hub/session…."  or just "/session…."
[2014-07-21 15:31:13] AutomatedTester: argh.. so I need to speak to Simon
[2014-07-21 15:31:40] AutomatedTester: I dont understand why we can't mandate server root
[2014-07-21 15:31:51] lukeis: because we don't want to? :)
[2014-07-21 15:31:58] AutomatedTester: WHY?
[2014-07-21 15:32:06] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 780
[2014-07-21 15:32:18] lukeis: it complicates the current implementations unnecessarily
[2014-07-21 15:32:42] AutomatedTester: and we havent done that already with say... actions?
[2014-07-21 15:32:51] lukeis: ;)
[2014-07-21 15:33:12] lukeis: this seems like we could easily fix it in the spec, vs. figure out how we best want to accomplish things
[2014-07-21 15:33:38] AutomatedTester: yea, thats why I am keep asking why
[2014-07-21 15:34:05] AutomatedTester: "because it is easy" isnt a good enough answer
[2014-07-21 15:34:16] *lukeis agrees'
[2014-07-21 15:34:31] lukeis: mandating a root though… not sure why we need to do that
[2014-07-21 15:34:56] lukeis: or we could just explain the root isn't a true root? ;)
[2014-07-21 15:35:18] AutomatedTester: all roots are equal but some roots are more equal than others
[2014-07-21 15:35:22] AutomatedTester: :D

[2014-07-21 15:36:21] lukeis: :-D
[2014-07-21 15:36:29] jleyba: Why not just leave it as /session/... with a note that paths are relative to server context?
[2014-07-21 15:36:35] jleyba: which may be root, or something else
[2014-07-21 15:36:38] lukeis: :)
[2014-07-21 15:37:12] lukeis: this is spec authorship we're talking about… we have to be pedantic
[2014-07-21 15:37:14] tony4, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-21 15:37:59] jleyba: Seems pedantic enough to me. Paths are absolutely defined.
[2014-07-21 15:38:11] jleyba: Implementors are free to define what "root" is though :-)
[2014-07-21 15:38:22] *lukeis implements what I want ;)'
[2014-07-21 15:38:48] AutomatedTester: its my implementation and I will cry if I want to
[2014-07-21 15:38:51] jleyba: or we can just delete all of SeRC, change the java server to use / instead of /wd/hub and be done with it
[2014-07-21 15:39:15] lukeis: Se 4. :(
[2014-07-21 15:39:23] AutomatedTester: Se 3.5
[2014-07-21 15:39:40] lukeis: seems like a major release to break compatibility to me ;)
[2014-07-21 15:40:06] jleyba: I still don't understand why we can't just do it in 3.0
[2014-07-21 15:40:08] lukeis: of course… we deprecate in a point release and remove in the next o.0
[2014-07-21 15:40:15] lukeis: simon is why ;)
[2014-07-21 15:40:35] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I don't understand either
[2014-07-21 15:40:54] lukeis: it makes it easier to allow the LegRC package to still exist
[2014-07-21 15:41:06] AutomatedTester: but me wanting to make ALL THE BREAKING CHANGES in 3 has put me in the bad books
[2014-07-21 15:41:16] AutomatedTester: *shrug*
[2014-07-21 15:41:22] jleyba: That's what major versions are for
[2014-07-21 15:41:50] AutomatedTester: <- the converted
[2014-07-21 15:41:56] jleyba: We've been telling people to stop using RC for a while now.  It's a waste of time to require a major version just to officially deprecate the stupid thing

[2014-07-21 15:43:00] lukeis: even though my work would have *fun* with Se3 not containing RC… but we'd figure out a hack
[2014-07-21 15:43:39] AutomatedTester: so... people dont have to upgrade
[2014-07-21 15:43:47] AutomatedTester: thats the point of version numbers
[2014-07-21 15:43:54] lukeis: ;)
[2014-07-21 15:44:27] lukeis: Selenium "release" channel / Selenium "beta" channel / Selenium "nightly" channel ;)

[2014-07-21 15:45:41] AutomatedTester: for the remote end
[2014-07-21 15:45:43] lukeis: only implementations
[2014-07-21 15:45:50] lukeis: IE11 doesn't work for RC for us ;)
[2014-07-21 15:45:55] AutomatedTester: implementors will hold all the cards
[2014-07-21 15:45:59] jleyba: Even more reason to get rid of SeRC
[2014-07-21 15:46:16] lukeis: and we made the decision to not try to make RC work with IE11… WebDriver only… motivation to move the masses
[2014-07-21 15:46:22] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you guys should hire jimevans... he knows a thing or two about IE
[2014-07-21 15:46:36] lukeis: except that guy refuses to work on RC ;)
