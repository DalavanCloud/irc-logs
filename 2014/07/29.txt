[2014-07-29 10:54:26] lukeis: ato: "./go clean firefox" :)
[2014-07-29 10:54:38] lukeis: ato: assuming you have all the dependency libraries installed
[2014-07-29 10:54:38] ato: ty
[2014-07-29 10:54:42] barancev: luckily, there is not many complains about missin native events nowadays
[2014-07-29 10:54:57] ato: Well I compile Firefox all the time.
[2014-07-29 10:55:07] lukeis: then you *should* have everything :)
[2014-07-29 10:55:28] lukeis: can't say if we depend on something else though or not
[2014-07-29 10:55:33] ato: So it's complaining about missing headers.
