[2014-07-24 05:34:18] WhereIsMySpoon: i use xpath a lot

[2014-07-24 05:34:23] WhereIsMySpoon: well not a *LOT*

[2014-07-24 05:36:27] WhereIsMySpoon: would that not still use xpath under the hood?
[2014-07-24 05:36:29] ato: The problem is that IE doesn't have an XPath engine.
[2014-07-24 05:36:32] WhereIsMySpoon: or would it use something else

[2014-07-24 05:37:51] WhereIsMySpoon: guess its slow
[2014-07-24 05:37:54] WhereIsMySpoon: more maintenance
[2014-07-24 05:37:56] WhereIsMySpoon: etc
[2014-07-24 05:38:11] WhereIsMySpoon: plus it will behave differently purely because it isnt the same thing
[2014-07-24 05:38:13] ato: There are many arguments really, those are two of them.
[2014-07-24 05:38:22] [1]JP: Plus it becomes a problem if support stops for said third party product

[2014-07-24 05:38:42] WhereIsMySpoon: sucks? :p
[2014-07-24 05:38:54] ato: I think the primary one is that it feels sad to specify something in the spec which a vendor can't support natively.

[2014-07-24 05:40:24] [1]JP: From a personal perspective if you can find a way to find inner text through other means than XPath then I'd happily remove XPath locators from my solution(s)
[2014-07-24 05:40:25] ato: The first one can't be done easily I think.

[2014-07-24 07:02:12] jimevans: el_fuego: it kinda depends on what you're using the shell scripts for, i suppose.
[2014-07-24 07:02:13] Dave_B_: properly? Very hard - a page may have a loader that substitutes an image for another if the original isn't found etc. You could check the image element is displayed, but beyond that you'd probably have to check the size or something. You'd probably be better just checking that you get a valid response from the image location or something.

[2014-07-24 07:02:50] Dave_B_: you'd need to set up your own el_fuego

[2014-07-24 07:03:03] Dave_B_: or use saucelabs or someone to run the grid for you

[2014-07-24 07:53:06] jimevans: let me lay out my argument.
[2014-07-24 07:54:41] Dave_B_: I think this is a sexist industry and lots more could be done to address that - but an individual company having more men than women doesn't make that company sexist
[2014-07-24 07:54:47] Dave_B_: but that's just my view *shrug*
[2014-07-24 07:54:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ agree
[2014-07-24 07:55:13] jimevans: if, say facebook really, really *REALLY* wanted to increase their diversity of, say, women in its workforce, there are qualified, talented women working at places that are not facebook who could be recruited. if they were serious, and i mean down-and-out serious, about it, they could make "godfather" offers to, say malini das or trish koo (to name two), who could probably be enticed to jump ship with the right incentives.
[2014-07-24 07:55:46] WhereIsMySpoon: then that just means that other companies decrease their diversity
[2014-07-24 07:55:52] WhereIsMySpoon: that doesnt help the problem it just moves it around
[2014-07-24 07:55:53] jimevans: note to AutomatedTester: i'm not saying malini would leave mozilla. i don't actually believe she would. i'm just mentioning, by name, someone who's talent i respect. :)
[2014-07-24 07:56:00] Dave_B_: which would be positive discrimination which is questionable and would do nothing, at all, to the industry diversity as a whole
[2014-07-24 07:56:05] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-07-24 07:56:33] WhereIsMySpoon: thats the same as lowering standards for say african american candidates for a particular company
[2014-07-24 07:56:39] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-24 07:56:39] WhereIsMySpoon: just because theyre a minority
[2014-07-24 07:56:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: but that would require Malini to move to the US
[2014-07-24 07:56:42] jimevans: (and who i know personally, instead of just by reputation)
[2014-07-24 07:56:54] AutomatedTester: which is a non-starter to be honest
[2014-07-24 07:57:01] [1]JP: Problem is your just moving people from one place to another (that's not a bad thing, certain companies have the sort of aura where it helps a lot). If we really want to solve this, it'll take time - the industry needs to shake the stereotypes off and say to EVERYONE "look at all the cool stuff you can do"
[2014-07-24 07:57:04] Dave_B_: to hire someone because they are female risks alienating all your existing female staff
[2014-07-24 07:57:24] WhereIsMySpoon: mmhm
[2014-07-24 07:57:29] [1]JP: Bringing new people in over the next generation will really do the trick I reckon
[2014-07-24 07:57:41] WhereIsMySpoon: we just need to stop analysing this crap and remove all discrimination, positive and negative
[2014-07-24 07:57:53] WhereIsMySpoon: and stop treating people differently
[2014-07-24 07:58:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: yeah, i know. again, i was just naming names of people i know personally. my network of people i know personally in the industry (and who's work i know well enough to respect) is pretty small.
[2014-07-24 07:58:12] p_l: WhereIsMySpoon: saying that will get you flamed in some circles, afaik
[2014-07-24 07:58:18] jimevans: s/who's/whose/
[2014-07-24 07:58:18] WhereIsMySpoon: p_l: Im well aware

[2014-07-24 07:58:23] Albino1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-24 07:58:27] WhereIsMySpoon: the point is that obviously negative discrim is bad
[2014-07-24 07:58:33] WhereIsMySpoon: and positive risks being condescending
[2014-07-24 07:58:33] Dave_B_: I have a lot of problems with the fashionability of 'brogrammer' culture though, got offered a job with a company that i declined and later found out they were very into 'being manly' and kinda jerks
[2014-07-24 07:58:49] WhereIsMySpoon: and unfair
[2014-07-24 07:59:03] p_l: Dave_B_: Generally, if you want female discrimination in tech, it gets worse the closer to USA you're, apparently
[2014-07-24 07:59:07] [1]JP: Brogrammer culture is awful
[2014-07-24 07:59:25] p_l: And it got worse when "brogrammer" turned from mostly harmless joke it was in beginning into the abomination
[2014-07-24 07:59:27] jimevans: heh. i'm far too old to be part of the "brogrammer" culture. :)
[2014-07-24 07:59:36] *WhereIsMySpoon doesnt even really know what it is'
[2014-07-24 07:59:39] WhereIsMySpoon: and im 23
[2014-07-24 08:00:01] Dave_B_: I thought I was too old, until I discovered that people my age were actually living it :(
[2014-07-24 08:00:09] Dave_B_: WhereIsMySpoon: you're lucky
[2014-07-24 08:00:09] Biswa: Onlyyyyy 23 ?
[2014-07-24 08:00:23] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: brogrammers will hire a female and then treat her as "one of the guys"
[2014-07-24 08:00:25] WhereIsMySpoon: Biswa: whats that mean?
[2014-07-24 08:00:40] jimevans: i'd be far willing to bet i'm among the oldest people in the chat room at the moment.

[2014-07-24 08:01:15] WhereIsMySpoon: I mean I'd just treat her as like...herself

[2014-07-24 08:02:37] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-07-24 08:02:44] WhereIsMySpoon: i get what u mean
[2014-07-24 08:02:48] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds idiotic
[2014-07-24 08:02:55] Dave_B_: sexist/sexual 'banter' being not just accepted but encouraged
[2014-07-24 08:03:07] WhereIsMySpoon: i mean
[2014-07-24 08:03:50] WhereIsMySpoon: if I find a particularly amusing joke which is somewhat sexist, I find that no different to finding a particular amusing joke that is somewhat racist or at the expense of a religion
[2014-07-24 08:04:07] WhereIsMySpoon: if it isnt meant to hurt then I dont see any issue with it, as long as you dont do it all the time
[2014-07-24 08:04:31] p_l: Dave_B_: a bit of that is American puritanism at work, though (http://satwcomic.com/it-s-complicated <--- wonderfully depicted here)
[2014-07-24 08:04:32] WhereIsMySpoon: but hiring a woman just so you can make sexist jokes at them sounds...weird

[2014-07-24 08:07:07] AutomatedTester: they dont hire to actively harass, they hire someone because "they fit a culture we don't have" which is never good
[2014-07-24 08:07:22] Dave_B_: it's always hard - you don't want to give the feeling of being an oppressive workplace, but you don't want to establish a culture that will make it uncomfortable for women to work
[2014-07-24 08:07:29] Dave_B_: and sometimes things slide
[2014-07-24 08:07:58] *WhereIsMySpoon doesnt really think its that hard...'

[2014-07-24 08:08:30] Dave_B_: we have a gif of the day thing here - it's generally a kitten doing something stupid or whatever, but some places manage to take similar ideas and end up with it being something like 'babe of the day' which is clearly inappropriate but they somehow don't see it
[2014-07-24 08:08:32] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont see the issue
[2014-07-24 08:08:51] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: thats like college-level stuff
[2014-07-24 08:08:57] WhereIsMySpoon: if that
[2014-07-24 08:09:01] Dave_B_: yeah - some people never grow up

[2014-07-24 08:09:23] p_l: In some places the reaction would be the women adding "hunk of the day"
[2014-07-24 08:09:29] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2014-07-24 08:09:33] WhereIsMySpoon: I bet that would get the men riled up

[2014-07-24 08:09:58] WhereIsMySpoon: I just think its weird

[2014-07-24 08:11:22] WhereIsMySpoon: I feel that on the whole UK and europe as a whole just doesnt over-analyse these issues as much as the US does

[2014-07-24 08:11:34] dude-x: we have 4 female devs at work
[2014-07-24 08:11:48] jimevans: that's because legal liabilities are vastly different between the US and the rest of the world.

[2014-07-24 08:13:54] jimevans: part of the problem is this, though: how do you make things right when someone has been legitimately harmed?
[2014-07-24 08:14:00] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: Im sure it does exist here
[2014-07-24 08:14:01] AutomatedTester: for the most part these things are super subtle
[2014-07-24 08:14:26] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: you settle it between the parties involved and dont make a gigantic deal out of it
[2014-07-24 08:15:04] p_l: Sometimes yes, it has to go to the court... but if your first action is making a twitter lynch mob………
[2014-07-24 08:15:11] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-07-24 08:15:20] ato: jimevans: Making policies is the worst thing you can do.  Act locally with both parties.
[2014-07-24 08:15:45] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: okay, not go all reductio ad absurdium on this, but when one party has been harmed (an employee) and the other party doesn't agree there has been harm (the employer), how do you "settle it"?
[2014-07-24 08:16:00] dude-x: I don't know... i have one coworker i would hate to be in charge of hiring people; he looks for people who fit "the culture"
[2014-07-24 08:16:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you go to court and bring in lawyers
[2014-07-24 08:16:10] dude-x: i would like to have define policies
[2014-07-24 08:16:18] jimevans: oh. i see. so it's okay to sue in that case?
[2014-07-24 08:16:36] WhereIsMySpoon: your first action shouldnt be to sue and create mobgs
[2014-07-24 08:16:37] WhereIsMySpoon: mobs
[2014-07-24 08:16:45] WhereIsMySpoon: your first action should be to try and settle it like adults
[2014-07-24 08:16:47] jimevans: didn't say it was.
[2014-07-24 08:16:49] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2014-07-24 08:16:53] WhereIsMySpoon: thats why this isnt hte first action
[2014-07-24 08:16:58] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: but who settles it?
[2014-07-24 08:17:12] AutomatedTester: what if their manager is "one of the lads"
[2014-07-24 08:17:18] p_l: jimevans: that's when "work law court" steps in here
[2014-07-24 08:17:26] jimevans: but, and here's the most important bit, you can't pick and choose *which* cases are okay to sue about and which aren't.
[2014-07-24 08:17:33] AutomatedTester: there needs to be an impartial person to handle this
[2014-07-24 08:17:46] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, usually that's why you have a 3rd and maybe 4th party
[2014-07-24 08:17:49] WhereIsMySpoon: say HR
[2014-07-24 08:17:59] AutomatedTester: right
[2014-07-24 08:17:59] jimevans: ah, but HR *isn't* impartial.

[2014-07-24 08:21:49] jimevans: well, no, i'm pretty sure they are related, at least peripherally. in particular, with the absence of women in tech, who often are not in tech because the men in tech can't manage to not be a-holes.

[2014-07-24 09:22:56] jimevans: asmecher: that's the plan, to eventually replace selenium IDE with builder. and it should use webdriver natively.
[2014-07-24 09:23:03] jimevans: but that's probably a way off.
[2014-07-24 09:23:49] jimevans: mostly because on one on the current dev team really believes in the record-playback paradigm, except as a marketing gimmick to put the selenium project on par with commercial tools that offer them.
[2014-07-24 09:24:16] jimevans: (hint: they're not much more than a sales and marketing gimmick for the commercial vendors too, but they won't tell you that.)

[2014-07-24 09:33:43] WhereIsMySpoon: winner #3494852
[2014-07-24 09:33:53] asmecher: jimevans, I've got a suite of apps that need consistent test data. They run under MySQL and PostgreSQL, various versions. I want a consistent data suite to test upgrades, do presentations, and base unit tests on, but don't want to manually maintain it. A scripted playback to build that suite from scratch seems like the best way. Open to other ideas, of course.
[2014-07-24 09:33:56] barancev: asmecher: Selenium IDE is not going to be killed, it just stops evolution
[2014-07-24 09:34:25] WhereIsMySpoon: asmecher: the point is that if you use selenium IDE you DO have to manually maintain each test
[2014-07-24 09:34:39] barancev: because it uses old API, and rewriting it to the new API is non-sense because there is SeBuilder already
[2014-07-24 09:34:39] WhereIsMySpoon: if any single part of the site changes that your tests uses, you have to re-record
[2014-07-24 09:34:44] WhereIsMySpoon: or go in and change the xml yourself
[2014-07-24 09:35:42] asmecher: Agreed, and it's proven a pain so far. But less painful than maintaining DB dumps for several versions of MySQL and several versions of PostgreSQL. The latter just means we don't test consistently at all, and we still waste time in grunt work.
[2014-07-24 09:36:32] asmecher: Anyway, I didn't know people were so dismissive of record/playback. If that's reflected in the tools as well, I'll move the scripting over to PHP or something.
[2014-07-24 09:37:10] jimevans: asmecher: for me, it'd be a lot less of a pain to have the data-generating scripts in a "real" programming language, using a horribly inelegant API like selenium RC. but that's just me.
[2014-07-24 09:37:26] WhereIsMySpoon: im sorry, what does sql have to do with this
[2014-07-24 09:37:50] vilmos_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-24 09:37:50] asmecher: WhereIsMySpoon: as I said, I'm not testing per se, but generating a data suite from a fresh install using scripted playback.
[2014-07-24 09:38:22] asmecher: The data is later used in unit tests, for presentations, design work, etc.
[2014-07-24 09:38:39] jimevans: also, it sounds like you'd be better off doing direct sql injection into the back-end db to populate it. it'd likely be faster by a great deal
[2014-07-24 09:38:47] barancev: recording is not hard. maitaining of the recorded scripts is. because recorders are not intelligent enough to generate maintainable code
[2014-07-24 09:39:47] jimevans: asmecher: and i'm rather familiar with the issue that you're describing. it exactly describes the kind of problem we needed to solve with the product i used to work on at my previous employer.
[2014-07-24 09:40:17] asmecher: jimevans, hence the problem with supporting a variety of MySQL and PostgreSQL and cleanly maintaining the data. There are MySQL<=>PostgreSQL converters, but since we need integration testing of the front end, this kills two birds with one stone.

[2014-07-24 09:41:18] jimevans: and again, i point to using a "real" programming language, with proper tools and IDE support.
[2014-07-24 09:42:00] jimevans: but, as i always say, i really don't know what i'm talking about, not having done automated software testing for very long.

[2014-07-24 09:43:17] asmecher: All right, looks like it's over to phpUnit for data build as well. I was hoping this wouldn't be a dev task but looks like that's unavoidable.

[2014-07-24 10:03:26] simonstewart: I promised to start leading a discussion here on how we’ll add new people to the group

[2014-07-24 10:03:54] simonstewart: I suspect that of the 5 people in the group now, only two (maybe three, at a push) have been active

[2014-07-24 10:04:39] simonstewart: So my initial idea is to find some way to revivify the three spaces that are currently fairly inactive
[2014-07-24 10:04:54] simonstewart: git log --format=format:%ae --since 2014-01-01 | awk '{ hash[$1]++ } END { for (w in hash) print hash[w] "\t" w }' | sort -n | tail
[2014-07-24 10:05:10] simonstewart: Gives a representative sample of who’s been active this year in the code base
[2014-07-24 10:05:38] simonstewart: And we have it written in the agreement with the sfc that only one person from each company can be on the committee
[2014-07-24 10:05:52] barancev: github provides some statistics too -- https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/graphs/contributors
[2014-07-24 10:06:01] simonstewart: Which gives us a potential pool of 7 people to draw from
[2014-07-24 10:06:07] barancev: (you can select a time slot)
[2014-07-24 10:06:27] simonstewart: Shell commands FTW

[2014-07-24 10:08:37] lukeis: wait till your in SF again? ;)
[2014-07-24 10:09:05] simonstewart: So, my suggestion: we’re pinging the current members of the committee to see if they’d like to stay involve (there are only five)
[2014-07-24 10:09:22] asmecher, leaving. ("Ex-Chat")
[2014-07-24 10:09:24] lukeis: and if they don't respond boot them? ;)
[2014-07-24 10:09:39] simonstewart: Yes. For those people who don’t want to stay involved, we’ll use $SOME_MECHANISM to select replacements
[2014-07-24 10:09:48] simonstewart: Ideally from the currently active pool of contributors
[2014-07-24 10:10:09] simonstewart: (or, put another way, from the pool of people who have shown an ongoing committment to the project)
[2014-07-24 10:10:13] lukeis: and ask that pool if they even want to ;)
[2014-07-24 10:10:20] lukeis: (some i think don't)
[2014-07-24 10:10:22] simonstewart: And ask that pool if they want to
[2014-07-24 10:10:24] simonstewart: Indeed.
[2014-07-24 10:10:29] simonstewart: It’s a voluntary thing
[2014-07-24 10:10:59] simonstewart: So, what should $SOME_MECHANISM be?
[2014-07-24 10:11:07] barancev: btw, what is the purpose of this commitee?
[2014-07-24 10:11:14] lukeis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2014-07-24 10:11:15] simonstewart: To represent the project to the SFC
[2014-07-24 10:11:36] simonstewart: The SFC handle things like our cash and legal matters
[2014-07-24 10:11:41] simonstewart: And our trademarks
[2014-07-24 10:11:50] jleyba: we have trademarks?
[2014-07-24 10:12:13] simonstewart: We needed to apply for one for “Selenium” in reference to web testing
[2014-07-24 10:12:28] barancev: ok, wrong question. what are functions of this committee?
[2014-07-24 10:12:33] simonstewart: So that we could use it for SeConf ’14, where Agile FAQs are handling things
[2014-07-24 10:12:37] jimevans: jleyba: that was my reaction too, but apparently we do.
[2014-07-24 10:12:58] simonstewart: It’s pretty light weight. There was a thread ages ago when we joined the SFC
[2014-07-24 10:13:07] KyleG: We talked about it yesterday
[2014-07-24 10:13:12] KyleG: and you guys said the trademark was donated
[2014-07-24 10:13:21] simonstewart: But, essentially, if there are legal or financial matters that the SFC need decisions made on, the committee do that
[2014-07-24 10:13:25] KyleG: 12:46:08 PM nirvdrum: Thoughtworks had it.  I think they donated it.
[2014-07-24 10:13:50] simonstewart: This is exactly the sort of thing that the SFC is for :)
[2014-07-24 10:16:09] simonstewart: My suggestion: when we’re ready, ask the people who are active committers to throw their hats in the ring
[2014-07-24 10:16:30] simonstewart: If the number of hats == the number of seats, then that’s that
[2014-07-24 10:16:31] *lukeis throws a hat ;)'
[2014-07-24 10:16:41] simonstewart: Otherwise, we can ask the SFC to host a vote
[2014-07-24 10:16:48] lukeis: sgtm
[2014-07-24 10:16:54] simonstewart: Which would use a single transferable vote
[2014-07-24 10:17:05] jimevans: well, if lukeis is in, i'm out. :)
[2014-07-24 10:17:11] lukeis: heh
[2014-07-24 10:17:32] simonstewart: That’s how it’d work :)
[2014-07-24 10:17:34] lukeis: what happens if you consider working for the borg again though? :)
[2014-07-24 10:17:40] jimevans: (if for no other reason than the "only one per company" rule)
[2014-07-24 10:17:57] simonstewart: The only contraint is “one person per company"
[2014-07-24 10:18:09] *nirvdrum will run a smear campaign against lukeis.'
[2014-07-24 10:18:11] simonstewart: Mainly to try and avoid capture of the project by  a single entity
[2014-07-24 10:18:11] jimevans: well, that's a bridge to be crossed when arrived at.
[2014-07-24 10:18:21] *lukeis will rock-paper-scissors with jim to really decide'
[2014-07-24 10:18:49] nirvdrum: Salesforce? More like Snotforce!

[2014-07-24 12:52:38] AutomatedTester: shoot
[2014-07-24 12:53:19] jimevans: it currently uses a property of "strategy" for the type of lookup to use. every current implementation uses "using". which should change?

[2014-07-24 12:55:51] jimevans: :)
[2014-07-24 12:55:57] AutomatedTester: marionette from a quick search appears to use "using"
