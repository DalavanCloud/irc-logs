[2014-07-14 02:16:15] barancev: this "permission denied" exception is thrown by addEventListener command, the line https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/element_cache.js#L71
[2014-07-14 02:16:34] barancev: any ideas why addEventListener can throw it and how to fix it?
[2014-07-14 02:16:34] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-14 02:16:55] Oxelist, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-14 02:17:14] AutomatedTester: my guess is that its throwing an error because we have a chrome object or reaching into chrome without explicitly asking for that property on that object
[2014-07-14 02:17:15] barancev: (it is thrown by addEventListener itself, not by the callback)
[2014-07-14 02:18:36] barancev: ownerWindow is a chrome window, and the whole cache code is executed in chrome context
[2014-07-14 02:19:00] AutomatedTester: sure but since we are an addon we need to ask for certain permissions
[2014-07-14 02:20:36] barancev: so '__qosId' must be a window object property, and we have no permission to access it, right?
