[2014-07-22 01:33:11] Joe____: ok
[2014-07-22 01:34:15] Joe____: I have test sute in Selenium IDE. How I can run it again after end of test sute?
[2014-07-22 01:34:49] WhereIsMySpoon: why on earth would you want to run the same suite twice
[2014-07-22 01:34:59] WhereIsMySpoon: and i dont think thats possible anyway
[2014-07-22 01:35:07] Joe____: I need loop test sute.
[2014-07-22 01:35:08] WhereIsMySpoon: dont use the ide
[2014-07-22 01:35:12] WhereIsMySpoon: it sucks
[2014-07-22 01:35:16] WhereIsMySpoon: program your tests
[2014-07-22 01:36:21] Joe____: After end of test sute, I need run it again and again, but I don't know what command do this.

[2014-07-22 01:36:25] *ato doesn't know IDE either'
[2014-07-22 01:36:45] *WhereIsMySpoon thinks that rerunning the same test suite multiple times is a waste of time'
[2014-07-22 01:37:17] WhereIsMySpoon: if you arent confident with your tests in the first place, then dont use them - rerunning the tests multiple times "just to be sure" is not a valid way of doing automated testing
[2014-07-22 01:37:34] WhereIsMySpoon: if they arent reliable they can just as easily fail 5 times in a row as well as succeed 5 times in a row
[2014-07-22 01:37:39] ato: It does seem to indicate that there's a stability problem with your tests.  But there are situations where it's needed, e.g. if some setup code which isn't directly a part of the tests fail to initialize properly.
[2014-07-22 01:38:02] Biswa: I have one Table in my application which contains constant values but display the values dynamically (Means everytime position of values get changed) . There is one value like "Selenium" . How can I find that ?
[2014-07-22 01:38:31] Joe____: No, it is not waste my time. This test suit just for testing stability my system. It should be rum every 15 minuts again and again. And whet it will fauils, I will know it.
[2014-07-22 01:38:36] WhereIsMySpoon: Biswa: we're going to need more info about your html
[2014-07-22 01:38:51] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe____: aha, so you want to run your tests as part of a CI
[2014-07-22 01:38:53] ato: Biswa: What kind of element type?
[2014-07-22 01:40:35] Biswa: this is only the Question I faced in my interview
[2014-07-22 01:41:13] ato: I don't want to come across as rude, but the answer to your question is probably to go RTFM.
[2014-07-22 01:41:31] Biswa: :)
[2014-07-22 01:41:49] ato: The actual answer is that it depends on the type of element.  If you're interested in the value you'd do element.get_attribute("value").  If it's the displayed text you go element.get_text().

[2014-07-22 07:10:20] wilhelm: AutomatedTester: "If the UA does not support these [mostly undefined] properties..." is a little dodgy, and lacking normative prose. Perhaps we should flip it around? Define the exact values we expect, dodging the tribal knowledge issue? Then say, non-normatively, that this should be equivalent to window.outerwidth.

[2014-07-22 12:02:48] jimevans: ingshtrom: for what browser? all? one specific? what/
[2014-07-22 12:02:49] jimevans: ?
[2014-07-22 12:03:50] ingshtrom: right now I am just testing with Chrome. It's not normalized between them all, huh?
[2014-07-22 12:04:00] jimevans: nope.
[2014-07-22 12:04:08] jimevans: IE doesn't report any logs whatsoever.
[2014-07-22 12:04:22] jimevans: for example
[2014-07-22 12:04:39] jimevans: and to forestall the inevitable question...
[2014-07-22 12:05:34] jimevans: it's because simonstewart hasn't finalized the logging API from a wire protocol standpoint. he's said several times that he's not happy with the server-side SPI nor the client-side API, so it's not been implemented yet until that's nailed down.
[2014-07-22 12:06:43] ingshtrom: ah. alright. That makes a lot of sense. I know that things were always hit or miss with logging, but I never heard the exact reason it was like that.
[2014-07-22 12:07:11] ingshtrom: so I should probably just forget about configuring it, grab what I can get for now, and wait for the logging API to be finalized?
[2014-07-22 12:07:23] jimevans: for IE, it's mainly that the maintainer is lazy and doesn't want to implement the same endpoints twice.
[2014-07-22 12:07:51] ingshtrom: man... who is that lazy maintainer?...
[2014-07-22 12:07:59] ingshtrom: jk. completely understandable
[2014-07-22 12:08:28] jimevans: i know, right? he's a total slacker. can't code his way out of a paper bag with two hands and a flashlight either. :)
[2014-07-22 12:11:53] ingshtrom: well FWIW I sure as hell appreciate your work because we (my company) wouldn't be able to use Selenium without you!
[2014-07-22 12:12:20] jimevans: heh. thanks

[2014-07-22 12:33:41] dude-x: and i remember the convo that it was slated for FF31
[2014-07-22 12:33:54] jimevans: that was the hope, because 31 is an ESR release
[2014-07-22 12:34:13] ato: Other things came in the way.
[2014-07-22 12:34:16] ato: Like Firefox OS.
[2014-07-22 12:34:21] jimevans: but alas, firefox os fire drills got in the way
[2014-07-22 12:35:31] p_l|backup: ... am I the only person horribly tempted to be snarky about firefox OS preempting something important? :)
[2014-07-22 12:37:36] ato: I think it's important in the regard that it brings someone who cares for open standards to the phone manufacturer table, which makes it difficult for other big software companies to do proprietary solutions to access native features through web APIs.
[2014-07-22 12:38:17] ato: Personally I care less about the phone flopping, because it's not intended for my market anyways.
[2014-07-22 12:39:11] p_l|backup: ato: given that Firefox OS APIs are pretty much all proprietary (the ones that aren't are already shared among two or three different vendors)...
[2014-07-22 12:39:44] ato: They are all proprietary?
[2014-07-22 12:39:50] ato: I don't think that's the case.
[2014-07-22 12:39:58] p_l|backup: APIs for Firefox OS apps != non-proprietary open standard APIs for web code
[2014-07-22 12:40:51] p_l|backup: just being open source under permissive license doesn't make them nonproprietary open standards, an argument that AFAIK Mozilla used before to push asm.js as competition for NaCL (n.b. NaCL started out as Firefox plugin)
[2014-07-22 12:40:52] ato: I'm referring to the native hardware access APIs primarily.
[2014-07-22 12:41:32] p_l|backup: ato: low-level drivers etc. are an issue with vendors of specific hw. Mozilla... doesn't appear to have much negotiating weight
[2014-07-22 12:41:49] ato: I think maybe “proprietary” vs “non proprietary” is a digression here; it's of course fine if Google decides to do a proprietary implementation of an open standard.
[2014-07-22 12:42:18] p_l|backup: APIs for accessing native features from web page (as opposed from OS-specific apps, are IMO quite well pushed in portable way
[2014-07-22 12:43:51] ato: Sure, and some of these API's did not come specifically from Mozilla.
[2014-07-22 12:43:57] ato: But they were mostly lacking in implementation.
[2014-07-22 12:44:11] ato: For example, I believe Intel was behind the NFC API.
[2014-07-22 12:44:38] p_l|backup: ato: in my experience they were usually first implemented then standardized... don't recall if NFC actually made it into web instead of Firefox-only
[2014-07-22 12:44:42] *ato doesn't care very much for which company backed a particular idea as long as it's a good one'
[2014-07-22 12:44:57] p_l|backup: ahh, there's something
[2014-07-22 12:45:07] ato: NFC isn't in Chrome on Android at least.  Or in WebKit.
[2014-07-22 12:45:26] AutomatedTester: lol at NFC
[2014-07-22 12:45:31] AutomatedTester: what a silly thing
[2014-07-22 12:45:38] ato: So NFC is actually quite useful
[2014-07-22 12:45:44] AutomatedTester: nice concept... yet no one cares about it
[2014-07-22 12:45:52] ato: Well you can pay with it in the US.
[2014-07-22 12:46:12] p_l|backup: ato: the html5 api for NFC on w3c page is pretty much useless for that
[2014-07-22 12:46:13] ato: And Oyster cards could essentially be implemented with NFC.
[2014-07-22 12:46:22] AutomatedTester: Oyster is RFID
[2014-07-22 12:46:23] p_l|backup: ato: Oyster won't work with that API, *ever*
[2014-07-22 12:46:41] ato: “potentially”
[2014-07-22 12:46:44] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: Oyster is NFC, just with the most ubiquitous and simultaneously crappy implementation
[2014-07-22 12:47:00] p_l|backup: ato: no, the Web NFC API doesn't have anything to implement it
[2014-07-22 12:47:21] Cerz, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-22 12:47:33] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: when did they update to NFC?
[2014-07-22 12:47:37] ato: So NFC was just an example here.
[2014-07-22 12:47:40] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: it was from start
[2014-07-22 12:47:52] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: Oyster is ISO-14443-3 compatible
[2014-07-22 12:48:03] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: hmm.. I remember the TFL boss complaining how shit it was and they were doing other things
[2014-07-22 12:48:10] p_l|backup: it just happens to layer NXP proprieary crap on top of it
[2014-07-22 12:48:13] ato: The point I'm trying to make is that it's important to care about standardization of Web APIs.
[2014-07-22 12:48:35] p_l|backup: ato: I agree. I just don't see Firefox OS really being a player in it - Mobile Firefox is bigger, IMO
[2014-07-22 12:49:06] ato: Right, but we're not doing it because we're trying to take over the world either.
[2014-07-22 12:49:12] AutomatedTester: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card needs updating
[2014-07-22 12:49:15] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: older Oyster cards run on Mifare Classic, which uses NFC physical, link layer etc.
[2014-07-22 12:49:15] AutomatedTester: it says RFID
[2014-07-22 12:49:28] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: RFID encompasses NFC
[2014-07-22 12:49:52] p_l|backup: (or close enough for it)
[2014-07-22 12:50:11] p_l|backup: it's just the newer term that talks more about free-form communication and actual standardization

[2014-07-22 12:53:19] AutomatedTester: MS have ~10 people working on there implementation
[2014-07-22 12:53:38] jimevans: AutomatedTester: o rly? i don't remember hearing that.
[2014-07-22 12:53:46] p_l|backup: ato: I've been doing some research to make Mifare work on non-NXP hardware. My list of people who should not meet me is growing ;>

[2014-07-22 12:54:47] jimevans: they have *10* people working on their implementation?!?!
[2014-07-22 12:54:48] ato: jimevans: Doesn't it feel good that you've essentially done the work of ten people for a very long time? (-;
[2014-07-22 12:54:56] jimevans: da phuque?!?!
[2014-07-22 12:55:03] jimevans: ato: that just sunk in
[2014-07-22 12:55:08] p_l|backup: ato: yeah. I wanted to make my N4 work with Mifare protocol, which means I have to kinda emulate a bit of it in software (mostly sucky crapto-1 algorithm that appears to be more for locking people to using NXP chips)
[2014-07-22 12:55:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans: not sure how many are fulltime
[2014-07-22 12:55:31] jimevans: even so.

[2014-07-22 14:25:26] threefive: howdy. quick question about selenium. when you assign a selenium element to a variable what is it doing under the covers? I assume it more or less making a snapshot of the dom in it's current state, but figure it has to be more than that.
[2014-07-22 14:26:15] threefive: i know if you assign something, delete the node, and readd it exactly you'll get a stale reference so it has to be more than "here is the dom", but can't find any explanation beyond that

[2014-07-22 15:04:24] jimevans: so.
[2014-07-22 15:04:54] jimevans: brockfredin: if you mean a new popup browser window, you want driver.SwitchTo().Window("<window handle>");
[2014-07-22 15:06:01] jimevans: threefive: so if you're talking about webdriver, there aren't any DOM snapshots involved. it's on the live DOM tree. just as if you'd used the debugging console of whatever browser you're using and executed javascript against the currently loaded page.
[2014-07-22 15:06:36] jimevans: "under the covers", it kinda depends on the driver implementation as to exactly what it's doing.
[2014-07-22 15:06:54] threefive: if it's always refering to the live dom, wouldn't stale references not really be a thing then?

[2014-07-22 15:10:39] jimevans: it'll error on you.
[2014-07-22 15:10:47] jimevans: your reference to the element is no longer valid
[2014-07-22 15:10:59] jimevans: even though the console works against the live DOM tree.

[2014-07-22 22:47:22] dannyfink: Hey pretty new to this chat. I was wondering if anyone has a best approach for automating account sign up in bulk. I don't have any trouble automating the process, but i'm using a library to generate a random email address, but sooner than later those email addresses begin to repeat and I'll run into an email is already registered case. I wasn't sure if integrating with our sql database makes sense and delete
[2014-07-22 22:47:23] dannyfink:  the user id created after the test runs or some other approach may be best.
