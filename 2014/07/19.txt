[2014-07-19 19:35:36] zagabar: I have recorded a macro with the selenium IDE for a particular page.
[2014-07-19 19:35:57] zagabar: IO am looking how to make it run automatically whenever that page is loaded, without me starting it or anything
[2014-07-19 19:36:04] zagabar: is that possible somehow? :)
[2014-07-19 19:37:05] zagabar: (I want to do this as a part of a process where I have a command-line script that opens the page in the web browser, and I want it to do stuff on the page as soon as it loads, so if i can execute it in the browser from command-line that would be alright too)
