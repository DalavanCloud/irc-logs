[2014-07-23 03:34:29] WhereIsMySpoon: theres no difference from the PoV of load testing whether you do it from a browser or from a request generation scriptr
[2014-07-23 03:34:31] WhereIsMySpoon: script
[2014-07-23 03:36:58] WhereIsMySpoon: right?
[2014-07-23 03:38:35] wilhelm: WhereIsMySpoon: A browser will have more realistic usage patterns. Hitting a cached front page for load testing is useless.
[2014-07-23 03:39:09] WhereIsMySpoon: right...thats why you'd do the requests with a script that can easily keep creating headers that force it to ignore the cache
[2014-07-23 03:39:20] wilhelm: Even if it didn't POST anything, it would fetch scripts, styles and images the way you'd expect.
[2014-07-23 03:40:28] WhereIsMySpoon: ok...I guess grabbing the resources is a legit reason

[2014-07-23 03:42:45] WhereIsMySpoon: mm
[2014-07-23 03:42:58] WhereIsMySpoon: I guess if you did it with phantomjs
[2014-07-23 03:43:04] WhereIsMySpoon: you could do it headlessly
[2014-07-23 03:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: which would prolly be faster
[2014-07-23 03:43:19] WhereIsMySpoon: and as you dont rly care about the functionality that much then it doesnt matter
[2014-07-23 03:43:22] WhereIsMySpoon: ur just doing load testing
[2014-07-23 03:44:46] wilhelm: Headless helps. But to do proper load testing of an interactive application, you'd need to write to the DB too, not just read from it. That makes the tests a bit more verbose.

[2014-07-23 09:45:38] jimevans: in css selectors, the ">" operator is "direct descendant".
[2014-07-23 09:45:40] dannyfink: Hey I'm looking for a best approach for handling data cleanup for sign up for new user test case. My random data library i'm using eventually starts generating emails that are not so random and i'll get the email already exists message. Without the hassle of integrating with our sql database anyone have a good approach on how to handle this? I also don't have a REST service to delete the user myself (may have to ask our API team to crea
[2014-07-23 09:45:40] dannyfink: te one though)
[2014-07-23 09:45:55] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i reference this all the time - http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048
[2014-07-23 09:46:37] jimevans: dannyfink: an api is the best option, imo.
[2014-07-23 09:46:49] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: not seen that link before, thanks!
[2014-07-23 09:47:27] dannyfink: thanks jim...think i'll have to make that request :)

[2014-07-23 09:51:01] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: except that css selectors are supported natively by all browsers. xpath isn't.

[2014-07-23 09:55:11] Dave_B_: or if it's not a direct descendant then ditch the '>'
[2014-07-23 09:56:05] Dave_B_: which i guess it wouldn't be - you got a whole table within a td? Or you ask your question back to front?

[2014-07-23 12:07:12] dude-x: it should work on all browsers if they have consistent locators, your milage may vary
[2014-07-23 12:07:28] jimevans: ma1: "guaranteed"? ha. a-haha. BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! haha. hoo...
[2014-07-23 12:07:32] jimevans: thanks i needed that.

[2014-07-23 12:08:32] jimevans: sorry to be snarky. what do you mean by "it will work"?
[2014-07-23 12:08:34] ma1: dude-x: Thanks, locators are consistent
[2014-07-23 12:08:55] jimevans: if you mean "do the drivers implement the commands," the answer is mostly "yes"
[2014-07-23 12:09:28] ma1: hm
[2014-07-23 12:09:35] jimevans: if you mean "will the driver implementations always work 100% of the time in all browsers," the answer is "there's really no way to tell consistently"

[2014-07-23 12:11:07] ma1: i just want to know could there be any issue if we use Action Chains in our tests
[2014-07-23 12:11:46] jimevans: again, you're asking for something that can't be safely answered for certain a priori.
[2014-07-23 12:12:22] ma1: actually i am using Action Chains in a project and they are working great without any issue
[2014-07-23 12:12:40] jimevans: i'm not willing to tell you "yes, for sure it will work" then have you come across an edge case i hadn't considered, and have you come back and say i lied to you.
[2014-07-23 12:12:56] ma1: but some team member raise question that is Action Chains are safe? Can we avoid them?
[2014-07-23 12:13:01] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-23 12:13:09] jimevans: in any case, there are certain actions that you can't do any other way than doing so-called "action chains"
[2014-07-23 12:13:33] ma1: yeah, right
[2014-07-23 12:13:48] jimevans: so it's kind of a moot point.
[2014-07-23 12:14:08] jimevans: i'm actually far more interested in the root concern behind the question.
[2014-07-23 12:14:08] ma1: exactly
[2014-07-23 12:14:32] jimevans: if there's a specific concern, it might be easier to at least address and talk about
[2014-07-23 12:14:52] jimevans: a generic "are action chains safe to use" is so broad as to be a meaningless question
[2014-07-23 12:15:12] ma1: just a minute
[2014-07-23 12:15:53] ma1: actually current we are using selenium 2.39.0
[2014-07-23 12:16:09] ma1: upgrading to latest version broke every test that is using Action Chains
[2014-07-23 12:16:12] plightbo_work, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-07-23 12:16:26] jimevans: in what language?
[2014-07-23 12:16:37] jimevans: and "broke" how?
[2014-07-23 12:16:45] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-23 12:16:57] ma1: Python
[2014-07-23 12:17:29] *smyers uses the junk out of ActionChains in python, and uses 2.42'
[2014-07-23 12:17:43] ma1: let me explain
[2014-07-23 12:18:32] ma1: we are using Action Chains to mouse over a button to open a menu
[2014-07-23 12:18:48] ma1: then within a menu we click on an option
[2014-07-23 12:19:06] ma1: after the upgrade the click is not working
[2014-07-23 12:19:52] jimevans: in what browser? all? some? one particular?
[2014-07-23 12:19:59] ma1: and the problem is only coming in Firefox
[2014-07-23 12:20:15] jimevans: on what OS?
[2014-07-23 12:20:19] ma1: we only test our project for Chrome and Firefox
[2014-07-23 12:20:27] ma1: in Chrome its working
[2014-07-23 12:20:28] jimevans: and what version of firefox?
[2014-07-23 12:20:39] ma1: Firefox version 25
[2014-07-23 12:20:54] ma1: OS: Ubuntu

[2014-07-23 12:21:30] jimevans: are you using native events? (if the answer is "i don't know", you probably aren't. you specifically have to turn them on for firefox on linux)
[2014-07-23 12:23:17] ma1: as far as i remember they are enabled. anyway i will check them
[2014-07-23 12:23:47] jimevans: if they're enabled, then you can't use firefox version 25 with 2.42 of the webdriver libraries.
[2014-07-23 12:24:16] ma1: in that case should i update firefox version?
[2014-07-23 12:24:26] jimevans: yes. to firefox 29.
[2014-07-23 12:24:46] ma1: hm
[2014-07-23 12:24:53] jimevans: (and i'm well aware that firefox 31 is out today.)
[2014-07-23 12:25:23] jimevans: we've dropped the ball keeping up with the latest firefox releases for native events.
[2014-07-23 12:25:29] ma1: actually the problem is we can't easily update the browser version
[2014-07-23 12:25:54] jimevans: then you're limited to two choices. don't update webdriver or don't use native events. full stop.
[2014-07-23 12:25:55] ma1: anyway i will update the firefox version and check it
[2014-07-23 12:26:30] ma1: if i don't enable the native events then Actions Chains will not work, right?
[2014-07-23 12:26:31] phasze: jimevans: is there a plan to catch up on FF native event implementation?
[2014-07-23 12:26:43] jimevans: ma1: incorrect.
[2014-07-23 12:27:01] jimevans: phasze: a plan? seriously? you think we're that organized?
[2014-07-23 12:27:08] phasze: lol

[2014-07-23 12:30:02] jimevans: the thing is, there's been nothing standing in the way of cutting a release to support firefox 30 for weeks now. it's just that no one's done it.
[2014-07-23 12:30:43] jimevans: 31 will take a little longer (because of lack of environment availability in CI)

[2014-07-23 12:39:05] jimevans: we already get a fair amount of sponsorship in terms of things like VMs/CI infrastructure. our friends at SauceLabs are very good about that.
[2014-07-23 12:39:23] KyleG: yeah I like SauceLabs
[2014-07-23 12:39:32] KyleG: Just made more sense for us to build our own grid, Sauce get's pricey
[2014-07-23 12:39:47] jimevans: they just don't have new versions of firefox available on their platform day-and-date

[2014-07-23 12:41:47] KyleG: Do you even really need it?
[2014-07-23 12:41:49] KyleG: Where would the $$ go?
[2014-07-23 12:42:58] jimevans: that'd be something for the steering committee to answer.

[2014-07-23 12:45:41] nirvdrum: But, yeah, I just wanted to cause trouble.
[2014-07-23 12:45:49] jimevans: is there a selenium trademark? i've honestly no idea.
[2014-07-23 12:46:00] nirvdrum: Thoughtworks had it.  I think they donated it.
[2014-07-23 12:46:36] jimevans: huh. learn something new every day.
[2014-07-23 12:47:36] jimevans: at any rate, the amount of actual financial sponsorship the project receives on an annual basis is quite small, if memory serves.
[2014-07-23 12:47:48] jimevans: (though i'm fully prepared to be told i'm completely wrong about that)
[2014-07-23 12:47:53] nirvdrum: Yeah.  We're not hiring people.
[2014-07-23 12:48:18] jimevans: i know some of it goes toward the conference every year, helping to keep it affordable.
[2014-07-23 12:48:23] nirvdrum: I think there's something from ads and sponsors, but I think that funnels directly into the conference.
[2014-07-23 12:48:39] jimevans: but afaik, no one gets paid by the project to work on it.
[2014-07-23 12:48:42] nirvdrum: And we carve out a percentage (20%) as a donation to the SFC.
[2014-07-23 12:49:02] nirvdrum: That was supposed to be (20%?).  I don't recall the actual number.
[2014-07-23 12:49:07] jimevans: yep. for legal overhead and such.
[2014-07-23 12:49:31] garndt: you mean the project doesn't sponsor a Selenium yacht?
[2014-07-23 12:49:51] KyleG: hrm
[2014-07-23 12:49:54] KyleG: if I wanted to sponsor a conference
[2014-07-23 12:49:57] KyleG: wouldn't I just buy a ticket and go?
[2014-07-23 12:49:59] jimevans: garndt: shhhh!! that's supposed to be a secret. :)
[2014-07-23 12:50:19] nirvdrum: KyleG: Most conferences use sponsors to subsidize ticket costs.
[2014-07-23 12:50:26] KyleG: right but
[2014-07-23 12:50:45] nirvdrum: It's actually really hard to run a conference that doesn't lose money.
[2014-07-23 12:50:51] KyleG: If I were to donate, I wouldn't want to be donating towards a conference. I want to donate to further selenium development and support the team who makes it possible
[2014-07-23 12:51:03] KyleG: I get that conferences attract more devs
[2014-07-23 12:51:08] KyleG: and more awareness and whatnot
[2014-07-23 12:51:35] KyleG: So writing code is the only way to further selenium? There's no way to donate to support people/group of people in their development endeavors ?
[2014-07-23 12:51:49] nirvdrum: KyleG: You can donate directly to the project.  But as it stands, most services are donated, so I'm not sure where the money would really go other than a conference.

[2014-07-23 13:08:13] jimevans: billhunt: yes, people are using WebDriver against IE8 and earlier.

[2014-07-23 13:09:03] nirvdrum: lukeis: I'm not even sure anymore.  It got changed when we started having an actual sponsors page.
[2014-07-23 13:09:07] billhunt: jimevans not my intent at all.

[2014-07-23 13:10:12] jimevans: the webdriver project runs a full suite of integration tests against 6 versions of IE on every commit to the project.
[2014-07-23 13:10:14] nirvdrum: IE < 8 doesn't have a native JSON implementation.  You need to load in a lib from json.org.  I dunno if we're relying on that, but I didn't think so.

[2014-07-23 13:11:47] billhunt: nirvdrum yup, familiar.  Using it on the test runner but apparently that's not enough to give selenium access to it.
[2014-07-23 13:12:06] billhunt: (And since I'm using a service and not actually controlling the server, could be out of luck ehre)
[2014-07-23 13:12:10] ato: jimevans: ++
[2014-07-23 13:12:30] billhunt: jimevans come on, 80% of the web can't possibly be wrong! ;)
[2014-07-23 13:12:36] nirvdrum: billhunt: You can inject stuff using executeScript().  It's not going to be fast, but it works.
[2014-07-23 13:12:44] lukeis: ohai ato, congrats! (didn't get to say it in-person on IRC yet :) )
[2014-07-23 13:13:27] jimevans: billhunt: didn't say anything against the languages themselves. no problem with 'em. but their webdriver language bindings (and the communities around them) is utterly broken.
[2014-07-23 13:14:08] billhunt: jimevans seems that way...
[2014-07-23 13:14:40] billhunt: nirvdrum Hmm, it's still going to require SauceLabs to add that from what I can tell, unless I can find some hook in their API I'm not yet aware of.
[2014-07-23 13:14:48] billhunt: Thanks though!
[2014-07-23 13:14:59] nirvdrum: Ahh, yeah.  Dunno then.  Sorry.
[2014-07-23 13:15:57] jimevans: what's mostly broken is that everyone insists on writing their own bindings, instead of coalescing around one and improving it. and for javascript, there's even an official one provided by the project!
[2014-07-23 13:16:18] jimevans: i'm just disgusted with the not-invented-here syndrome that seems so prevalent in those communities.
[2014-07-23 13:16:57] *garndt runs off to write a JS binding'
[2014-07-23 13:17:19] nirvdrum: I'm still impressed anyone willing writes JS.
[2014-07-23 13:17:24] nirvdrum: *willingly
[2014-07-23 13:17:46] billhunt: jimevans In general, the JS community in the last few years is morally opposed to not-not-reinventing the wheel.  Literally saw a node implementation reinventing awk/sed the other day.  Eh.
[2014-07-23 13:19:00] *lukeis tries to avoid commenting on this topic…. momma said, if you don't have anything nice to say… ;)'
[2014-07-23 13:19:43] jimevans: aw, lukeis, you can dish here. if you don't have anything nice to say, come sit by me! :)
[2014-07-23 13:21:14] garndt: I will be needing to spend quite a bit of time to learn more about JS. Scary!  Might need to sent in a rescue vessel after me.

[2014-07-23 14:36:35] WhatAVerse: Hi, I know this is frequently asked, but I have a slight variation to the question.
[2014-07-23 14:36:57] WhatAVerse: Is there a way for ajax calls to finish, but without knowing a specific element to be ready?
[2014-07-23 14:38:14] robpark, quitting. (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[2014-07-23 14:38:38] dude-x: WhatAVerse: explain what you mean
[2014-07-23 14:38:58] WhatAVerse: I’m using python, so to me it seems like one solution would be to run a proxy server in one thread, set the webdriver to use the proxy, then make the .click() request, and simply wait until the proxy has finished loading all get requests.
[2014-07-23 14:39:06] WhatAVerse: But is there a simpler way?
[2014-07-23 14:39:37] dude-x: there is WebDriverWait
[2014-07-23 14:39:51] dude-x: you can write functions to poll the browser for specific things to show up
[2014-07-23 14:40:03] WhatAVerse: But it seems like you have to wait for a given element. What if I don’t know any elements in advance?
[2014-07-23 14:40:35] dude-x: how can you call .click, if you don't have a webelement that you retrieve via find_element
[2014-07-23 14:40:57] WhatAVerse: I can do that, but what if only a specific part of the page changes?
[2014-07-23 14:41:06] WhatAVerse: (Not the part with the clickable element(
[2014-07-23 14:41:21] dude-x: if the element changes you have to re-find the element
[2014-07-23 14:41:28] WhatAVerse: What I mean is
[2014-07-23 14:41:29] dude-x: which means polling
[2014-07-23 14:42:10] WhatAVerse: Say that there is a page. Most of the page stays the same when this button is clicked (dom isnt refreshed). However, a small part of the page changes.
[2014-07-23 14:42:14] dude-x: so you want to find an element that occurs as a result of a click?
[2014-07-23 14:42:41] WhatAVerse: I want to get the whole page source, but only after the effects of click have been realized.
[2014-07-23 14:42:54] dude-x: if you click a button, and something on the page changes, then the dom is changed
[2014-07-23 14:43:10] WhatAVerse: Part of it, not the whole thing.
[2014-07-23 14:43:10] dude-x: then using a webdriver wait, after you click, you wait for that element to show up
[2014-07-23 14:43:26] WhatAVerse: Say that this needs to work for any given website.
[2014-07-23 14:43:27] dude-x: then you can grab page source and go to town
[2014-07-23 14:43:42] WhatAVerse: So I cannot know anything in advance.
[2014-07-23 14:43:51] dude-x: is this some sort of scraper?
[2014-07-23 14:44:00] WhatAVerse: Something like that
[2014-07-23 14:44:01] dude-x: i suppose you will have to poll something....
[2014-07-23 14:44:13] dude-x: you will have to poll the part you expect to change
[2014-07-23 14:44:26] dude-x: only problem is....
[2014-07-23 14:44:36] WhatAVerse: That would work, but again, I don’t know what to expect.
[2014-07-23 14:45:06] WhatAVerse: That’s why I want to use a proxy server, running in a seperate thread.
[2014-07-23 14:45:14] dude-x: you better hope the webpage you open has something you can poll via find element that doesn't make webdriver "blind" because of AJAX or mutating dom stuff
[2014-07-23 14:45:40] WhatAVerse: It can wait until all requests have finished, then I just get the page source afterwards.
[2014-07-23 14:46:14] dude-x: well in that case, you can use execute_script and write some javascript that will poll the ajax count
[2014-07-23 14:46:20] dimacus, quitting. (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[2014-07-23 14:46:46] dude-x: if your site uses jQuery you can check if jQuery.active === 0 meaning that there are no more active requests
[2014-07-23 14:46:59] WhatAVerse: Yeah, thats exactly what I’m looking for
[2014-07-23 14:47:05] WhatAVerse: But a more general solution.
[2014-07-23 14:47:20] WhatAVerse: Since I don’t know if they will be using jQuery, etc.
[2014-07-23 14:48:20] dude-x: i don't know of a general stragey; i have seen companies use webdriver as a scraper but they have sophisitcated algorithms to look at pages
[2014-07-23 14:48:56] dude-x: most websites don't have cookie cutter UI's
[2014-07-23 14:49:59] WhatAVerse: Right, but say something like this:
[2014-07-23 14:50:57] WhatAVerse: http://pastebin.com/UnfNxUw8
[2014-07-23 14:51:10] WhatAVerse: See block_until_finish
[2014-07-23 14:53:27] dude-x: well block until finish seems to imply stuff at the proxy level
[2014-07-23 14:53:41] dude-x: the proxy won't know since it doesn't run javascript
[2014-07-23 14:53:58] dude-x: the thing is, if webdriver knows when a page has finished loading
[2014-07-23 14:54:06] dude-x: that would solve a lot of problems in using webdriver for testing
[2014-07-23 14:54:26] WhatAVerse: Right, that’s why I’m waiting before and after
[2014-07-23 14:54:44] dude-x: you can wait for the page to load all resources
[2014-07-23 14:54:46] WhatAVerse: The thing is, with a single page app, theres no way to know when its truly ‘done’
[2014-07-23 14:55:05] WhatAVerse: You can only really know when it isn’t in the process of downloading things
[2014-07-23 14:55:06] dude-x: you can know if you know the app you're using, but you can't generalize that
[2014-07-23 14:55:19] WhatAVerse: Sure, but yeah, not generalizable
[2014-07-23 14:55:45] WhatAVerse: Basically thats why I have “# Now wait for the page to respond to the new data”
[2014-07-23 14:55:49] rodrigomartin, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-07-23 14:56:02] dude-x: you can probably use raw javascript and poll if there are active XML HTTP Requests open
[2014-07-23 14:56:07] WhatAVerse: Anyway, thanks for your help. It doesn’t seem like there’s a much better solution.
[2014-07-23 14:56:17] dude-x: and then that's it
[2014-07-23 14:56:29] WhatAVerse: That’s what I tried to do, but I couldn’t find how.

[2014-07-23 15:16:17] lukeis: or review description
[2014-07-23 15:16:27] *AutomatedTester wants a critic like tool at Mozilla'
[2014-07-23 15:17:19] lukeis: we've talked about it in the F2F meetings about using the wptserve… so i was trying to do that ;)
[2014-07-23 15:17:24] lukeis: https://github.com/lukeis/web-platform-tests/commit/0128116fdc00283ff3e4f31d4865adeb820dfb29
[2014-07-23 15:17:27] ato: lukeis: Okay, so I'm not sure about that patch.
[2014-07-23 15:17:31] lukeis: ok :)
[2014-07-23 15:17:34] ato: lukeis: The one that's linked in the description.
[2014-07-23 15:17:37] lukeis: code review comments appreciated!
[2014-07-23 15:17:49] ato: I think the patch for wptserve might be fine as-is.
[2014-07-23 15:18:20] lukeis: that commit linked ^ would need a further code review after the wptserve got merged
[2014-07-23 15:18:23] ato: I'm working on a patch integrating the webdriver spec tests with wpt, which entails using the wptserve instance wptrunner starts for us.
[2014-07-23 15:18:33] lukeis: ok
[2014-07-23 15:18:38] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-07-23 15:18:47] ato: So wptrunner starts a single instance of wptserve which is kept alive throughout the course of all the tests.
[2014-07-23 15:18:50] lukeis: don't mind you doing it, just that's what I saw when i wanted to replace it
[2014-07-23 15:19:04] ato: No, the basic AUTH handler seems fine I think.
[2014-07-23 15:19:27] *lukeis is now confused ;)'
[2014-07-23 15:19:34] ato: There are two patches here, right?
[2014-07-23 15:19:37] lukeis: yes
[2014-07-23 15:19:44] ato: One patch for adding AUTH to wptserve.
[2014-07-23 15:19:49] lukeis: https://github.com/lukeis/web-platform-tests/commit/0128116fdc00283ff3e4f31d4865adeb820dfb29   and https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2049
[2014-07-23 15:19:52] ato: And one for changing webdriver/base_test.py to use it.
[2014-07-23 15:19:59] lukeis: yes
[2014-07-23 15:20:16] lukeis: so you like the wptserve one, but not the web-platform-tests one
[2014-07-23 15:20:24] lukeis: ?
[2014-07-23 15:20:28] ato: I think the latter patch is wrong because we shouldn't be rolling this code ourselves because it's already part of wptrunner.
[2014-07-23 15:20:36] ato: Yes.
[2014-07-23 15:21:00] lukeis: ah yes, makes sense… this felt more like a baby step though :)
[2014-07-23 15:21:27] ato: Yes, I'll have a patch ready which I'll Cc you on within the week that we can compare.
[2014-07-23 15:21:33] lukeis: cool
[2014-07-23 15:21:41] ato: It's just been more work than I thought.
[2014-07-23 15:21:50] lukeis: slacker!
[2014-07-23 15:22:03] lukeis: what'd you do? go get married or something? ;)
[2014-07-23 15:22:08] ato: http://sny.no/2014/07/status
[2014-07-23 15:22:19] ato: ↑ I've done quite a bit, despite getting married
[2014-07-23 15:22:31] lukeis: maybe shouldn't be proud of that? :-D
[2014-07-23 15:23:09] lukeis: i love that you had PTO days that you did quite a bit ;)
[2014-07-23 15:23:40] lukeis: which by love i mean affectionately as insane ;)
[2014-07-23 15:24:15] lukeis: ok… i's gots to go… see y'all later (channels JJ)
[2014-07-23 15:24:16] ato: I only did reviews on two days of my PTO. (-:
[2014-07-23 15:24:22] ato: Yes, talk late.r

[2014-07-23 23:56:46] susundberg: Hey, we are using selenium for testing. We are using linux as development platform and our target platform is IE8 (thanks to customers IT department). We are having troubles with file uploads: it seems like the path to file needs to be absolute (no problem, we use store to $base_path) but now we see troubles with path-separators, linux '/' and windows '\\' : is this really the case ?
[2014-07-23 23:57:24] susundberg: Oh, and we are using the IDE for creating / running the testcase
[2014-07-23 23:57:55] susundberg: and now we are at phase we we try to run the testsuite with windows+firefox (as it works in linux+firefox)
[2014-07-23 23:58:37] susundberg: I see obvious hack that use $separator to handle the case but it really seems hackhish
