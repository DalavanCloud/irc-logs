[2014-07-03 01:52:00] Timvde: Hi. I am experimenting with Selenium in Python to test a website. I am using the Firefox driver. I can find the element perfectly, but I can't interact with it because is_displayed() is False. However, for some reason which I didn't find out yet, my CSS is not loading. Could that be related? But also without CSS, I can see the element in the browser window that popped up.

[2014-07-03 01:56:05] plushwork: Timvde: the css breaks when the driver disconnects
[2014-07-03 01:57:25] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-03 01:58:01] Timvde: plushwork: I'm an intern at a company, and their CSS handling is kinda atypical. It's just getting a 404 in the test case I set up atm. It's not really about "did Selenium break my CSS?", but "did the absence of CSS break Selenium?", or any other reasons why I can't interact with the element
[2014-07-03 01:58:27] Timvde: Also its location is {'y': 0, 'x': 0} and its size {'width': 0, 'height': 0}
[2014-07-03 01:59:20] Timvde: But I'm using find_element_by_id, and the tag_name is correct, so it looks like it did find the right element
[2014-07-03 01:59:48] Timvde: Mind you: I'm new to Selenium, I might be doing stupid things :)
[2014-07-03 02:00:35] plushwork: Timvde: put a breakpoint in there, run the test in debug and then use the element inspector in the browser to check what's up with the element/how many elements there are
[2014-07-03 02:00:53] Timvde: plushwork: I'm already at that point :)
[2014-07-03 02:01:05] Timvde: That's how I got the location, size and tag_name
[2014-07-03 02:01:12] ato: jxzrobert: Can you be more specific?
[2014-07-03 02:01:17] plushwork: but yeah, lack of css breaks things but I'd rather say it should be always visible then the other way around
[2014-07-03 02:01:46] Timvde: plushwork: Yea, I was expecting that too, because without CSS, it can't even be hidden
[2014-07-03 02:01:59] tony2, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-07-03 02:02:14] plushwork: Timvde: there are inline styles always.
[2014-07-03 02:02:51] ato: Yes, there's always a base.css that browser uses to render a standardized look of what you call “without CSS” documents.
[2014-07-03 02:03:44] dcoder_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-03 02:04:04] Timvde: Anyway, the element is visually displayed in the test browser window
[2014-07-03 02:05:36] ato: Does it happen across different browsers?
[2014-07-03 02:06:32] Timvde: I was first using webdriver.PhantomJS, but switched to Firefox to try to debug the ElementNotVisibleException
[2014-07-03 02:07:31] ato: I didn't read the backlog very carefully, but an element with 0 width and height at position 0,0 sounds suspicious.

[2014-07-03 02:35:45] Timvde: Hmm. It looks like something might be wrong in my selector. Finding by id / xpath with id given yields the wrong result, but using the xpath to first locate the encapsulating div seems to work
[2014-07-03 02:36:24] AndreiH, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-03 02:36:41] Timvde: This works as xpath: //div[@class='page with-sidebar-left']//li[@id='register']
[2014-07-03 02:36:43] Timvde: This does not: //body//li[@id='register']"
[2014-07-03 02:36:59] Timvde: No other element with "register" as id though...
[2014-07-03 02:37:59] Timvde: (And that div is a direct child of body, btw)
[2014-07-03 02:38:02] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: // selects from current node

[2014-07-03 02:43:21] Timvde: I only started looking into xpath today, but as I understand it, / looks for a direct child, while // looks for all descendants
[2014-07-03 02:43:26] WhereIsMySpoon: also if you have an id
[2014-07-03 02:43:28] WhereIsMySpoon: why are you using xpath

[2014-07-03 02:44:31] WhereIsMySpoon: is your element visible?
[2014-07-03 02:44:41] Timvde: The one I need, yes
[2014-07-03 02:44:49] WhereIsMySpoon: is it behind something?
[2014-07-03 02:44:57] Timvde: And when using //div[@class='page with-sidebar-left']//li[@id='register'], it works and I can interact with it

[2014-07-03 02:47:25] Timvde: Yea, I'm not sure :) But finding by id seems to find another element at position (0,0) and size (0,0) that is not visible
[2014-07-03 02:47:39] Timvde: And my mind is blown
[2014-07-03 02:48:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: Im having a strange issue with chroemdriver when switching windows. It does the switchTo.window("blah") fine but then when I try to do anything in or with that window, the log shows [2.383][INFO]: Waiting for pending navigations... and then times out
[2014-07-03 02:48:36] Dave_B_: slightly odd question - but as the finds may take different amounts of time, could there be a race condition? the element is created at 0,0 then moved or some such?
[2014-07-03 02:48:37] WhereIsMySpoon: and I get a TimeoutException

[2014-07-03 07:42:23] Cerz: if a class has a space in its name, for example: <div class="message error"> how do I get that to work using driver.findElement(By.className(...
[2014-07-03 07:42:24] jimevans: there may be some slight differences in the support classes.

[2014-07-03 07:43:21] WhereIsMySpoon: also works
[2014-07-03 07:43:37] Cerz: I had just tried that, but I might have made a mistake, I'll try it again, thanks.

[2014-07-03 07:43:54] WhereIsMySpoon: does driver.findElement(By.className("message error")) not work?
[2014-07-03 07:43:58] jimevans: nope.
[2014-07-03 07:44:01] WhereIsMySpoon: why o.o
[2014-07-03 07:44:03] Cerz: no, it doesn't
[2014-07-03 07:44:20] jimevans: By.className sees it as a "compound class name", which is expressly forbidden by that finder.
[2014-07-03 07:44:29] jimevans: in reality, it's not one class, it's two.
[2014-07-03 07:44:41] WhereIsMySpoon: why is it forbidden?
[2014-07-03 07:44:53] jimevans: because className implies a single class name.
[2014-07-03 07:44:57] jimevans: it's defined that way.
[2014-07-03 07:45:01] WhereIsMySpoon: hm I guess
[2014-07-03 07:45:11] jimevans: and css selectors offer up a superset of that behavior anyway.

[2014-07-03 07:46:25] WhereIsMySpoon: bleh
[2014-07-03 07:46:28] Cerz: or do I remove the space from it now?
[2014-07-03 07:46:38] jimevans: Cerz: you'll likely want ".message.error" but yeah.
[2014-07-03 07:46:50] jimevans: css classes cannot contain spaces.

[2014-07-03 07:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: probably java
[2014-07-03 07:49:26] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i dispute that assertion.
[2014-07-03 07:49:42] ism: would any other language have better suppor?
[2014-07-03 07:49:54] ism: jimevans: why?
[2014-07-03 07:50:03] Cerz: Alright! It's fixed now, thanks @jimevans!
[2014-07-03 07:50:17] WhereIsMySpoon: Cerz: the @ is just his op status :)
[2014-07-03 07:50:34] jimevans: ism: any of the core language bindings provided by the project (.NET, python, ruby, or java) have reasonably good "support". it depends on what you mean by "support".
[2014-07-03 07:50:45] jimevans: Cerz: glad to help.
[2014-07-03 07:50:54] ism: what is used the most in industry?
[2014-07-03 07:51:09] jimevans: again, it depends.
[2014-07-03 07:51:16] WhereIsMySpoon: I actually see python quite a lot in SO posts
[2014-07-03 07:51:27] WhereIsMySpoon: not seen much of c#, some java
[2014-07-03 07:51:34] jimevans: if you want raw download numbers, nothing can touch the ruby bindings, because watir-webdriver is based on them.
[2014-07-03 07:51:46] WhereIsMySpoon: watir-webdriver?
[2014-07-03 07:51:54] L0u1s, changing nick to L0u0s.
[2014-07-03 07:52:00] jimevans: yep, an implementation of the watir api that is based on webdriver.
[2014-07-03 07:52:18] *WhereIsMySpoon looks up watir'
[2014-07-03 07:52:43] WhereIsMySpoon: cool o:
[2014-07-03 07:52:49] jimevans: also, the .net bindings are what the official microsoft cross-browser testing solution for visual studio coded-ui tests are based on.
[2014-07-03 07:53:52] jimevans: if you're asking what language has the most users using the raw webdriver api without benefit of a wrapper api, the answer (sadly) is probably java.
[2014-07-03 07:54:58] jimevans: but i get very defensive when people say "webdriver has the best support in java". i (and other contributors) work very very hard to maintain the other language bindings to the same level of implementation support as each other language binding.
[2014-07-03 07:55:20] jimevans: if something is present in java, but not another language binding, there's usually a damned good reason.
[2014-07-03 07:56:00] WhereIsMySpoon: he said support, I interpreted that as "people using it that can help you"

[2014-07-03 07:56:55] jimevans: anyone who can't translate webdriver code from c# to java and back by just looking at the code probably doesn't know the library well enough for their help to be worth a damn anyway.
[2014-07-03 07:57:06] WhereIsMySpoon: true :p
[2014-07-03 07:57:22] jimevans: the languages really aren't *that* different.
[2014-07-03 07:57:27] jimevans: syntactically, anyway.

[2014-07-03 07:58:20] cgoldberg: jimevans, i spent a few years writing shoddy C# code that was essentially a translation of Java in my head... initial versions of C# were nearly identical to Java

[2014-07-03 08:00:51] jimevans: from a library support standpoint, linq is rather nice, as are extension methods.

[2014-07-03 08:03:23] barancev: the only feature I know missing in .net binding is access to logs
[2014-07-03 08:03:42] barancev: or may be it is already implemented?
[2014-07-03 08:04:42] jimevans: barancev: no, it's not implemented. i've purposely not implemented it because simonstewart has said he's not happy with either the client-side api (for java) nor the server-side spi (for the wire protocol), and it's likely to change.
[2014-07-03 08:04:54] jimevans: (hence the "damned good reason")
[2014-07-03 08:05:23] ChammyCHam: so i'm setting up an automated test suite (first time) for our SaaS solution.  it looks like i'm supposed to break my tests down into self-contained files that setup and tear down.  however my question is our product of course requires a login....so i assume i need to add the login process to every test? seems kind of repetitive but I guess i could create a function that runs in each test to keep it to one line?
[2014-07-03 08:05:57] WhereIsMySpoon: ChammyCHam: that's what I've done :)
[2014-07-03 08:05:58] barancev: jimevans: btw, can you pls look at #7367 , we have to configure Json.NET somewhere to stop interpreting dates, but I can't find the exact place in the code where this should be added

[2014-07-03 08:06:13] ChammyCHam: ok cool
[2014-07-03 08:06:16] WhereIsMySpoon: ChammyCHam: its important to make all your tests self-contained
[2014-07-03 08:06:19] jimevans: ChammyCHam: most people handle that by setting the appropriate cookie, rather than going through the login UI.
[2014-07-03 08:06:30] ChammyCHam: unfortunately we don't have a 'remember me' cookie yet
[2014-07-03 08:06:35] ChammyCHam: or is that something i can build on my own?
[2014-07-03 08:06:55] ChammyCHam: i assume it has to be implemented in the product for it to look for / read
[2014-07-03 08:07:01] ChammyCHam: if so, it doesn't exist currently
[2014-07-03 08:07:07] jimevans: i'd bet that the server is setting a session cookie at least.
[2014-07-03 08:07:13] ChammyCHam: ah good point
[2014-07-03 08:07:15] Cerz: if you're performing tests on a website that you need to be logged in for, is the best way to code it to have the whole log-in procedure include in the @Before section?
[2014-07-03 08:07:30] jimevans: Cerz: see my previous comment.
[2014-07-03 08:07:50] ChammyCHam: ill talk to our developers and will mill about, great idea jimevans. t hat way i can have a test for login, then the rest ill just create the cookie
[2014-07-03 08:07:50] Cerz: oh wow
[2014-07-03 08:07:54] Cerz: that was just asked! haha
[2014-07-03 08:08:02] ChammyCHam: pretty weird timing eh lol
[2014-07-03 08:08:44] jimevans: ChammyCHam: if your product is already using a session cookie, you probably don't need a change in the product, just need to know how to establish the session on the server, and construct the cookie for the browser to use.
[2014-07-03 08:08:54] jimevans: then you can use the webdriver cookie api to set it.\
[2014-07-03 08:09:20] ChammyCHam: hmmm ok.  will have to look around how to do that via my good friend google
[2014-07-03 08:09:52] jimevans: well, talk to the developers about how your application establishes a session, and if a session cookie is used. :)
[2014-07-03 08:10:15] cgoldberg: jimevans, I got hooked on Python back before C# had all the fancy features and diverged from java more.  Python really grabbed me and I've been mainline one-language since :)

[2014-07-03 08:10:49] ChammyCHam: looks like i found the session cookie 'expires when browsing session ends'
[2014-07-03 08:10:54] ChammyCHam: so i'll just have to figure out with them how to create it

[2014-07-03 08:13:16] Cerz: Going on the logic that it's using a temporary firefox profile, and closing it after each test, maybe if it was using a specific profile it would store the cookies?
[2014-07-03 08:13:17] jimevans: barancev: is there a java test for this case?
[2014-07-03 08:13:58] barancev: jimevans: for dates? no. because in Java thyt are plains strings, as well as in json

[2014-07-03 09:14:20] ism: I did
[2014-07-03 09:14:27] ChammyCHam: so i found how to set the host, i have to be on the page when the cookie generates, so i guess have to generate it, then navigate to the page again, or better to refresh it?
[2014-07-03 09:15:03] jimevans: ism: go back into the *sigh* nuget package manager and install the "WebDriver.Support" package to your solution.

[2014-07-03 09:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: and modest with it
[2014-07-03 09:26:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2014-07-03 09:27:00] lukeis: ChammyCHam: either way… typically the best practice is to load a very light weight page on the domain, like a 404 page and then go to the page that would need that cookie set
[2014-07-03 09:27:29] lukeis: jimevans: you are the main dude for .NET / C# and IE pre-11  for sure ;)
[2014-07-03 09:27:43] jimevans: lukeis: okay, i'll cop to that.
[2014-07-03 09:28:10] lukeis: and now windows phone driver too ;)

[2014-07-03 09:35:57] WhereIsMySpoon: did you export as webdriver backed ?
[2014-07-03 09:36:14] ism: no

[2014-07-03 09:38:05] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah, but my point is that if you choose "webdriver" as the export, you don't want "webdriver-backed" anything. that means something special.
[2014-07-03 09:38:18] jimevans: ism2: use :gist or similar to paste your code

[2014-07-03 10:43:43] dude-x: ChammyCHam: the basic thing for a page object is this. Your __init__ takes a driver object (or the weapper to the driver), it's a class object; it will have locators for fields (attributes in python parlance). the methods are actions related to page in question

[2014-07-03 12:11:22] ChammyCHam: but it just does the old test and doesn't let me do anything new
[2014-07-03 12:13:00] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 786
[2014-07-03 12:15:35] smccarthy: you have to explicitly say when you want the browser to close (in WebDriver). So if you want to re-use the same browser, you can (I believe). Just create the driver instance once per test suite, and each test will use the same driver. However this is probably not reccomended for a few ways. One is because you cant run your tests in parallel than
[2014-07-03 12:16:03] ChammyCHam: well the thing is i have my login test, which is fine
[2014-07-03 12:16:14] ChammyCHam: but then i also need to use that login at the beginning of all other tests, because i need to be logged in
[2014-07-03 12:16:29] ChammyCHam: so it's less about reusing the browser and more about creating a reusable login function

[2014-07-03 12:26:32] dude-x: ism: if a test fails an assert, the rest of the code is not executed for that function
[2014-07-03 12:26:47] dude-x: ChammyCHam: see that's your page object
[2014-07-03 12:27:21] tony2, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-03 12:27:28] ChammyCHam: i guess my confusion is what are the pieces of the page object mentality?  i understnad i'm supposed to separate code from tests
[2014-07-03 12:27:43] dude-x: a page object will have the locators of a page
[2014-07-03 12:27:50] dude-x: it will have methods to interact with the page
[2014-07-03 12:27:54] ism: does webDriver have anything like verify in IDE where you can fail a verify but it will still run the rest of the code?
[2014-07-03 12:27:54] ChammyCHam: i don't know what locators are....so guess i have to start there
[2014-07-03 12:27:57] dude-x: think about a typical logi n age page;
[2014-07-03 12:28:10] ChammyCHam: ism: assertFalse does that in python, i think
[2014-07-03 12:28:11] dude-x: locators are the things you write for by_id, by_css_selector, by_xpath
[2014-07-03 12:28:20] ChammyCHam: oh ok im using a locate by_id
[2014-07-03 12:28:42] ism: ChammyCHam: I'd start with CSS, it's my favorite
[2014-07-03 12:28:48] dude-x: ism2: you have to log the error, or try: except/catch the assert failure
[2014-07-03 12:28:53] ism: that works too
[2014-07-03 12:29:00] dude-x: but don't use an assert
[2014-07-03 12:29:00] ChammyCHam: so where should i store the actual username / password
[2014-07-03 12:29:23] dude-x: ChammyCHam: at the advanced level, credentials are stored in a separate file; at the basic level, in the test itself
[2014-07-03 12:29:33] ChammyCHam: ism: I don't know much about CSS, not sure how it would help me locate a specific item
[2014-07-03 12:29:43] dude-x: learn XPATH and CSS Selectors
[2014-07-03 12:29:55] dude-x: without that basic skill, writing webdriver tests would be very difficult
[2014-07-03 12:30:09] ChammyCHam: dude-x: OK so using page object style i basically have two files, my page object with all logic, then the actual tests in a separate file?
[2014-07-03 12:30:18] dude-x: ChammyCHam: yes
[2014-07-03 12:30:21] ChammyCHam: the articles i was reading recommended against using CSS and Xpath....this is so confusing
[2014-07-03 12:30:31] dude-x: no, CSS and XPATH are preferred
[2014-07-03 12:30:45] ChammyCHam: ugh i just want to give up :(
[2014-07-03 12:30:56] dude-x: you have to write them to be terse and specific to the element, without being too specific that the slightest change of the html breaks a test
[2014-07-03 12:31:07] dude-x: id is the fastest sure, but not every element uses an ID
[2014-07-03 12:32:24] ism2: is there any simple way to maintain the same window across multiple tests? for example, i have a login page that i test and then i have a test after which tests the page that shows up after my login is done.
[2014-07-03 12:32:32] ism: ChammyCHam: id will be the best as long as everything has an id.
[2014-07-03 12:32:40] ism: and it doesn't change >.>
[2014-07-03 12:32:53] ChammyCHam: :'( RIP my brain
[2014-07-03 12:33:10] ChammyCHam: so generally how many different page object files do i have
[2014-07-03 12:33:12] ChammyCHam: how do i break them up
[2014-07-03 12:33:16] ChammyCHam: same goes for test case files
