[2014-07-25 10:03:07] selbot2: lukeis: note from ato about 6 hours ago: So I reviewed your patch, but I'm not sure what you plan on using it for.
[2014-07-25 10:04:26] lukeis: ato: did you not see the other change to web platform tests? it's needed in auth_tests.py   https://github.com/lukeis/web-platform-tests/commit/0128116fdc00283ff3e4f31d4865adeb820dfb29
[2014-07-25 10:04:42] phdjsep: If I instruct selenium to click a link, and that opens a new window, but the window sits on ‘Connecting’, is it possible for selenium to check that the window is still ‘Connecting’? From my understanding it’s not, but want to see of someone knows otherwise
[2014-07-25 10:05:28] ato: lukeis: Did you submit a PR for that?
[2014-07-25 10:05:40] lukeis: not yet, i was waiting on wptserve

[2014-07-25 15:59:22] dannyfink: Does anybody happen to work in an environment where test instances are created via feature branching where your selenium tests would need to grab the base url from github? Was interested to know any good tips on configuring to grab that base url if so.
