[2014-07-28 02:12:53] AshShelton: Hello, using selenium for our integration testing and we have quite a large suite now. about 900 tests. We video the runs to help investigate failures. Occasionally we get failures when we try to click links and buttons etc. Instead of clicking them, it sort of 'selects' them i.e. you see a bounding box around thing it tried to click. As if you tabbed through the DOM to the element. I was wondering if anyone else had come acros

[2014-07-28 03:57:46] simonstewart: We want a remote end to be able to detect whether a client is W3C or “selenium” compliant when speaking the wire protocol

[2014-07-28 03:58:46] simonstewart: Similarly, we want local ends that speak the W3C variant to be able to detect that the remote end is a selenium 2 server

[2014-07-28 04:37:02] [1]JP: Patabugen: The IDE does have its limits - Webdriver is more suited for AJAX heavy sites. You may want to start looking at that
[2014-07-28 04:37:14] [1]JP: It'll save you a lot of hassle in the long run
[2014-07-28 04:37:35] Patabugen: Ahh I thought that might be the answer!
[2014-07-28 04:37:44] Patabugen: That's ok, I need to make the switch sooner or later
[2014-07-28 04:37:54] [1]JP: Better to make it sooner in my opinion :)
[2014-07-28 04:38:13] Patabugen: I used to use the web driver actually, but recently I had a bit of trouble installing it and figured the IDE would do the job for now

[2014-07-28 04:51:18] Patabugen: What do you customise in the profile?
[2014-07-28 04:51:57] cryzed: Patabugen, I install Adblock Plus with all the default filters enabled / non-intrusive ads disabled so unnecessary graphics/ads arent loaded when running the tests/automation

[2014-07-28 04:56:57] cryzed: yes, it's not displayed by default in the firefox addon store
[2014-07-28 04:57:08] cryzed: Since it exceeds some RFCs regarding connection limits

[2014-07-28 04:59:11] Patabugen: I'm using Wamp
[2014-07-28 04:59:21] cryzed: Might have to do with your apache config and set concurrent requests
[2014-07-28 04:59:29] cryzed: but I'm not very experienced with that unfortunately
[2014-07-28 04:59:36] cryzed: but from what I recall the default apache settings aren't very ideal

[2014-07-28 06:15:00] barancev: simonstewart: how can the remote end determine the conformance level of a client?
[2014-07-28 06:15:56] simonstewart: _That_ is something I’m digging into :)
[2014-07-28 06:16:03] rananda, quitting. (Quit: /AWAY Leaving)
[2014-07-28 06:16:08] simonstewart: The main thing is that the w3c spec doesn’t require the sessionId in the json payload
[2014-07-28 06:16:21] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-28 06:16:22] simonstewart: So if we see that, then we know we’re dealing with a selenium-webdriver local end
[2014-07-28 06:16:42] barancev: what about startSession request?
[2014-07-28 06:17:01] barancev: should a server send text or numeric status?
[2014-07-28 06:17:17] barancev: if it can't detect conformance level of a client
[2014-07-28 06:17:22] simonstewart: startSession accepts that the field might be null
[2014-07-28 06:17:28] simonstewart: Which is the default value
[2014-07-28 06:17:47] simonstewart: So if you’ve got a w3c local end, and it sends the data as expected, the sessionId field will be missing
[2014-07-28 06:18:03] simonstewart: the selenium-webdriver local end sends the sessionId field, but sets it to undefined
[2014-07-28 06:18:04] barancev: well, I'd prefer a sort of version footprint, anyway :)
[2014-07-28 06:18:07] simonstewart: (or null)
[2014-07-28 06:18:42] barancev: e.g. as a payload of startSession request
[2014-07-28 06:19:19] simonstewart: noted

[2014-07-28 06:49:42] simonstewart: We use the capabilities to expose what you can and can’t do
[2014-07-28 06:49:51] simonstewart: Which is what the level would tell you
[2014-07-28 06:50:03] simonstewart: It’d be like using the browser version instead of feature sniffing
[2014-07-28 06:50:30] bl4ckscor3, changing nick to bl4ckgon3.
[2014-07-28 06:51:05] ato: Feature sniffing only sniffs for, well, that the feature as such is present.
[2014-07-28 06:52:02] ato: Isn't the point here to say for example that the takeScreenshot command takes a different set of arguments in Selenium WebDriver vs. W3C WebDriver?
[2014-07-28 06:52:32] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: re: parameters, you said you were going to document it
[2014-07-28 06:52:51] simonstewart: Yeah. And now I’m documenting it :)
[2014-07-28 06:52:53] AutomatedTester: thats all I remember
[2014-07-28 06:53:05] AutomatedTester: awesome
[2014-07-28 06:53:21] AutomatedTester: its blocking me from doing work on other areas of the spec
[2014-07-28 06:53:25] simonstewart: heh
[2014-07-28 06:53:41] simonstewart: Assume JSON over HTTP with the Content-Type of the request set to application/json
[2014-07-28 06:53:47] AutomatedTester: well I can do half and then when its done finish it off
[2014-07-28 06:53:54] AutomatedTester: sure
[2014-07-28 06:54:00] simonstewart: Given that the session id is encoded in the URL, we don’t need that to be sent
[2014-07-28 06:54:31] simonstewart: So the JSON object becomes a blob that looks like { ‘parameters’: {} }
[2014-07-28 06:54:39] AutomatedTester: ok
[2014-07-28 06:54:50] simonstewart: (which allows people to dangle interesting things off the blob without crashing named params
[2014-07-28 06:55:25] simonstewart: And also means that a local end doesn’t need to know whether the remote end is a selenium-server or a w3c compliant implementation
[2014-07-28 06:55:32] AutomatedTester: so there MUST be a webserver in the middle that we do HTTP requests to and then server to browser can be anything (HTTP, WS, Protobuf, etc)
[2014-07-28 06:55:43] simonstewart: Right.
[2014-07-28 06:55:49] AutomatedTester: ok
[2014-07-28 06:55:58] simonstewart: That was always in the spec: all implementations MUST provide something that speaks the wire protocol
[2014-07-28 06:56:22] simonstewart: Well, not in the _very_ first draft. But after the first f2f, where it was decided we needed that for interop to occur
[2014-07-28 06:56:24] AutomatedTester: we need to make sure that wire protocol describes a http server
[2014-07-28 06:56:31] simonstewart: No
[2014-07-28 06:56:36] AutomatedTester: why?
[2014-07-28 06:56:42] simonstewart: We need to ensure the spec defines the URL endpoints
[2014-07-28 06:56:47] simonstewart: And how they react to verbs
[2014-07-28 06:56:51] simonstewart: It’s not a server
[2014-07-28 06:56:56] simonstewart: It’s not an http server
[2014-07-28 06:57:00] simonstewart: It’s just an app running on one
[2014-07-28 06:57:20] simonstewart: The distinction is important

[2014-07-28 11:41:26] jimevans: use a webdriverwait or similar to wait for the select to have the proper number of options?
[2014-07-28 11:42:12] LocusAsaf: what would I be waiting for?

[2014-07-28 12:12:49] LocusAsaf: new question
[2014-07-28 12:13:13] LocusAsaf: is it possible to locate an option element inside of a select and then set that option as selected?
[2014-07-28 12:13:41] ato: An option element is just a child node of the select element.
[2014-07-28 12:14:03] ato: el = driver.find_element_by_css("select > option:nth-child(2)")
[2014-07-28 12:14:04] ato: el.click()
[2014-07-28 12:14:42] LocusAsaf: so if I click an option it will become selected?
[2014-07-28 12:14:46] ato: Some language bindings, like Java, have support classes for this.
[2014-07-28 12:14:53] ato: Yes.
[2014-07-28 12:15:18] LocusAsaf: awesome
[2014-07-28 12:15:32] ato: I think in Java you can do something like new Select(el).select("foobar") or something.
[2014-07-28 12:15:44] LocusAsaf: <- python implementation
[2014-07-28 12:15:56] LocusAsaf: I think that may do it for me though
[2014-07-28 12:16:01] LocusAsaf: Im testing it out now
[2014-07-28 12:16:36] ato: LocusAsaf: Turns out there is one for Python too: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#selenium.webdriver.support.select.Select

[2014-07-28 12:19:55] LocusAsaf: If I do a css locate for the select element and then ask it to choose an option the option is not yet present because it's being loaded by ajax
[2014-07-28 12:20:05] LocusAsaf: I've got a chain select thing going on
[2014-07-28 12:20:27] LocusAsaf: so I figured if I could locate the option than I would guarantee that the ajax has finished
[2014-07-28 12:20:32] ato: So the option elements are loaded in asynchronously as you click the select element?
[2014-07-28 12:20:57] ato: I'm not sure WebDriver will handle that well.
[2014-07-28 12:20:59] LocusAsaf: yeah it's a chain, so I select an option in on select and then ajax loads in the options for the next select
[2014-07-28 12:21:15] ato: You might have to click the select element first and cancel, then click the option element.
[2014-07-28 12:21:25] ato: The next select?
[2014-07-28 12:21:28] ato: You can't chain select's.
[2014-07-28 12:21:31] LocusAsaf: yeah like in a form
[2014-07-28 12:21:37] LocusAsaf: for instance
[2014-07-28 12:21:39] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-28 12:21:49] LocusAsaf: one select for country and another select for state
[2014-07-28 12:22:01] LocusAsaf: the options for state are chained to the country select
[2014-07-28 12:22:09] ato: Oh like that, okay.
[2014-07-28 12:22:12] LocusAsaf: so I select country, ajax fires to fill in state
[2014-07-28 12:22:35] LocusAsaf: so I want to select the California, only when ajax has completed filling in the state drop down
[2014-07-28 12:22:49] jimevans: LocusAsaf: right, so you wait for the <option> element you're looking for to exist.

[2014-07-28 12:23:10] ato: That sounds right to me.
[2014-07-28 12:23:39] ato: You should perhaps add an explicit test to check if the length of the state select gets populated as you choose USA as a country for example.
