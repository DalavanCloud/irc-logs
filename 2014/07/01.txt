[2014-07-01 12:27:45] jimevans: for whatever reason, chromedriver has an unknown error when you're trying to do that.
[2014-07-01 12:27:54] jimevans: it's not a .net thing. it's a chromedriver thing.

[2014-07-01 14:44:43] jjsanchez: is it possible to actually retrieve the document (not window) and then get the width on that?
[2014-07-01 14:46:00] jimevans: jjsanchez: sure. why not? if you can get it from javascript, you should be able to get it using the javascript executor
[2014-07-01 14:47:06] jjsanchez: i have tried several iterations of this, but no lock (this is in scala but similar to java):
[2014-07-01 14:47:06] jjsanchez: webDriver.asInstanceOf[JavascriptExecutor].executeScript("return $(document).width();").asInstanceOf[WebElement]
[2014-07-01 14:47:30] jjsanchez: i have tried with and without return
[2014-07-01 14:47:42] jjsanchez: in the browser, $(document).width() works
[2014-07-01 14:47:46] jimevans: return is correct, but it should return a number, not an element.
[2014-07-01 14:48:20] jjsanchez: should I be casting to an integer then not a web element?
[2014-07-01 14:48:39] jimevans: if width() returns an integer, then hell yes
[2014-07-01 14:50:59] dude-x: sounds like the US was just rejected
[2014-07-01 14:51:02] jimevans: (and i say "if width() returns", because you're [evidently] using jquery, and i have no idea what that effing library does)
[2014-07-01 14:51:35] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-01 14:52:52] jjsanchez: thanks jim, so return causes it to blow up, but if i remove return, and cast to an Int, it returns 0
[2014-07-01 14:53:02] jjsanchez: I will play around with that.. maybe i can do it without jquery then
[2014-07-01 14:55:29] jimevans: jjsanchez: you should be able to do just "return document.width;" or something similar.

[2014-07-01 14:59:45] nirvdrum: Then you have much bigger problems than TRACE.
[2014-07-01 14:59:45] lukeis: then you should do your own mechanism to handle security
[2014-07-01 15:00:15] nirvdrum: E.g., Selenium Server doesn't do SSL at all.

[2014-07-01 15:15:45] lukeis: full stop barancev's happiness

[2014-07-01 15:16:50] ato: Then checkout.
[2014-07-01 15:17:00] ato: (I must admit I usually do that.)
[2014-07-01 15:17:15] barancev: I follow simonstewart's instruction
[2014-07-01 15:17:26] *AutomatedTester normally let's lukeis merge'
[2014-07-01 15:17:37] barancev: fetch+cherrypick
[2014-07-01 15:17:41] *AutomatedTester is a good manager and delegates'
[2014-07-01 15:17:46] lukeis: heh
[2014-07-01 15:17:57] lukeis: yeah, i git fetch github and then cherry-pick
[2014-07-01 15:18:15] lukeis: then amend -s ;)
[2014-07-01 15:18:25] ato: Okay, my process differs.
[2014-07-01 15:19:22] ato: With Github pull requests I add a new remote, fetch that remote, check out the branch.  If it's behind, I rebase it.  Then if it's not well-formatted I squash it.  Then I amend the commit message and sign it off.  Then I checkout master and merge it.
[2014-07-01 15:19:48] ato: It's a little laborious, but it covers all bases.
[2014-07-01 15:19:50] lukeis: way too much process there ;)
[2014-07-01 15:20:06] ato: I should mention that I have git aliases for most of this.
[2014-07-01 15:20:10] lukeis: i have it configured to fetch the github pull requests into branches :)
[2014-07-01 15:20:24] ato: For example I have an alias that autosquashes fixups.
[2014-07-01 15:20:26] lukeis: i can then squash in that branch and then merge
[2014-07-01 15:21:03] ato: Yeah.  I just find it easier to get that person's next PR when I have it added as a remote as it doesn't require me to copy/paste.
[2014-07-01 15:21:27] ato: But it's really the same thing.
[2014-07-01 15:21:52] simonstewart: I do something similar to ato
[2014-07-01 15:21:57] ato: I'm also not so worried about one's process using git.
[2014-07-01 15:22:07] ato: I'm more worried about the general quality level of people's commit messages.
[2014-07-01 15:22:08] intchanter-work, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-01 15:22:20] simonstewart: Fetch the remote repo, create a new local branch, cherry pick on to that, squash, rebase on master, merge into master
[2014-07-01 15:22:22] ato: It's not uncommon that I edit people's commit messages to actually explain what it does.
[2014-07-01 15:22:28] simonstewart: That final merge should be a single commit
[2014-07-01 15:23:18] lukeis: git fetch --all;  git checkout pr/123; /* do stuff to their code if needed */ ;  git checkout master; git cherry-pick <hash>; git commit --amend -s; git push
[2014-07-01 15:23:27] lukeis: my full workflow ;)
[2014-07-01 15:24:22] dogarrhea: i'm worried that more bugs are being added :p
[2014-07-01 15:24:23] ato: That reminds me of an hg workflow.
[2014-07-01 15:24:35] ato: lukeis: Do you git add, then git commit --amend when you make a change to that commit on the branch?
[2014-07-01 15:24:37] lukeis: dogarrhea: all the time
[2014-07-01 15:24:51] dogarrhea: "let's introduce spider mites to eat all of the lice that currently exists"
[2014-07-01 15:25:07] lukeis: ato: i don't do git add anywhere
[2014-07-01 15:25:16] ato: So all your code is perfect on the first try?
[2014-07-01 15:25:25] ato: It doesn't happen that you go back and have to change unmerged code on a branch?
[2014-07-01 15:25:39] lukeis: if i make a change to their code, i make it as another commit
[2014-07-01 15:25:50] lukeis: my commit on top, so sometimes i do it as two commits ;)
[2014-07-01 15:26:00] ato: Okay.  I was thinking about your own personal code.
[2014-07-01 15:26:06] dogarrhea: since i'm using selenium, i change code alllll the time
[2014-07-01 15:26:27] dogarrhea: "flakey tests. flakey tests. flakey tests" "tests take too long to run locally to see what will break" blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2014-07-01 15:26:39] ato: My branch workflow is to commit individual changes, usually as fixups.  But sometimes I give them more verbose explanations if it's a big change I'm working on.
[2014-07-01 15:26:39] simonstewart: lukeis: I merge all the diffs in a logical change
[2014-07-01 15:27:04] lukeis: simonstewart: but I like to see the difference between their changes and my changes
[2014-07-01 15:27:14] ato: I have an alias called `git fixup FILE`, so I often to `git fixup -a` which references the last non-fixup commit.
[2014-07-01 15:27:34] ato: Then I have a `git squash` command which pulls all the fixups into the nearest commit proper.
[2014-07-01 15:27:50] ato: Because I like linear history
[2014-07-01 15:27:52] ato: .
[2014-07-01 15:27:55] lukeis: haven't used fixup before, i'll look :)
[2014-07-01 15:27:57] ato: Of course this isn't actually needed.
[2014-07-01 15:27:57] simonstewart: lukeis: I like my history to be linear and obvious
[2014-07-01 15:28:06] lukeis: i always keep it linear
[2014-07-01 15:28:14] dogarrhea: ato, my own code, when i release it to production to actually make money, stays pretty stable
[2014-07-01 15:28:22] ato: lukeis: There's nothing special about fixups.  It's just a special name in the commit message.  For my tool it just makes it easier for the machine to read it.
[2014-07-01 15:28:27] lukeis: just that contributor X did change Y and that I then changed it further with Z
[2014-07-01 15:28:56] ato: Yeah.
[2014-07-01 15:29:05] ato: I'm involved in several projects recently that doesn't use linear history.
[2014-07-01 15:29:08] lukeis: Y can (and often is) a squash of their changes
[2014-07-01 15:29:11] ato: But which use the Github merge button.
[2014-07-01 15:29:30] lukeis: i don't mind it too much
[2014-07-01 15:29:34] ato: It's not a big problem with merge commits until you have to reinstate a revert.
[2014-07-01 15:29:40] lukeis: selendroid does github merge button
[2014-07-01 15:29:47] ato: Which is mind-boggling difficult in git.
[2014-07-01 15:29:51] lukeis: ah, yeah, i could see that
[2014-07-01 15:30:04] ato: Yup.
[2014-07-01 15:30:08] lukeis: thankfully selendroid is a 'small' project
[2014-07-01 15:30:10] barancev: simonstewart: what copyright should be on the doc pages? http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/
[2014-07-01 15:30:10] ato: So depends a lot on the nature of the project I suppose.
[2014-07-01 15:30:15] lukeis: and not very active
[2014-07-01 15:30:38] ato: For mozilla-inbound it would be a nightmare.
[2014-07-01 15:30:44] ato: But it uses hg so we're fine (-:
[2014-07-01 15:31:08] ato: (Because inbound typically has several backouts a day.)
