[2014-07-10 03:32:45] phuh, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-10 03:32:45] Cz: that seems like a really neat thing
[2014-07-10 03:33:13] WhereIsMySpoon: it's useful, but you should try to use it as little as possible
[2014-07-10 03:33:19] WhereIsMySpoon: it's the most volatile of the selectors
[2014-07-10 03:34:00] Cz: I just used it to count a list
[2014-07-10 03:34:13] Cz: By.xpath("//ul[@id='jobs-list']//li")
[2014-07-10 03:34:36] Cz: thought that was a really cool :D
[2014-07-10 03:35:05] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-07-10 03:35:23] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: the bad thing about xpath is that it relies upon the fact that the page html stays the same throughout all of the xpath location
[2014-07-10 03:35:32] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: so if you change one bit of blah//foo/baz/bar
[2014-07-10 03:35:35] WhereIsMySpoon: then the whole selector fails
[2014-07-10 03:35:46] WhereIsMySpoon: and so do other ones that use the same path
[2014-07-10 03:35:52] Cz: ah
[2014-07-10 03:35:56] WhereIsMySpoon: whereas if you'd used id then its much safer
[2014-07-10 03:36:12] Cz: see I was using xpath because I couldn't find the ID
[2014-07-10 03:36:26] Cz: but in future I'll try stick with ID
[2014-07-10 03:36:28] WhereIsMySpoon: its something the dev has to put in
[2014-07-10 03:36:34] WhereIsMySpoon: ids arent required in html
[2014-07-10 03:36:55] Cz: is it good practice to use cssSelector? i use that a good bit too
[2014-07-10 03:37:06] WhereIsMySpoon: cssselector is fine
[2014-07-10 03:37:09] Cz: alright :)
[2014-07-10 03:37:57] WhereIsMySpoon: though again if you start having very complex css selectors and u decide you want to change the class name of a load of elements, then the css selectors for all those elemtns will breka
[2014-07-10 03:38:02] WhereIsMySpoon: you == the dev
[2014-07-10 03:38:11] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry, im used to being dev and test
[2014-07-10 03:38:12] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-07-10 03:40:04] Cz: :P
[2014-07-10 03:40:11] Cz: lets hope they don't start changing things
[2014-07-10 03:41:55] WhereIsMySpoon: Cz: that isnt the attitude you should have :P you should expect changes when you write the tests and make them as easy to change and maintain as possible
[2014-07-10 03:42:06] WhereIsMySpoon: whilst ofc making them robust and reliable

[2014-07-10 04:04:45] WhereIsMySpoon: What's the general formula/pattern when using page object model, if you have an element that on hover-over pops up a new menu of elements
[2014-07-10 04:05:05] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant really put the elements in the new menu as fields in the page object class as they cant get populated on page load
[2014-07-10 04:06:43] WhereIsMySpoon: or what do people here do?

[2014-07-10 04:24:35] Dave_B_: same probably. Also, you don't need to look up all objects on object creation, so can have lookups that would fail without prior actions like hovering

[2014-07-10 05:03:56] quattr8: is it possible to load an html file with all the dependencies(html/js/css/ajax etc), record all loaded dependecies and save this to a log with selenium?
[2014-07-10 05:04:30] WhereIsMySpoon: quattr8: what do you mean by "all dependencies"
[2014-07-10 05:04:53] WhereIsMySpoon: if you mean "all <script> tags that import js files", then thats fairly easy
[2014-07-10 05:04:58] girija, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-10 05:05:33] quattr8: What I want to do is some performance testing, especially on banner ads and capture all the requests it goes thru
[2014-07-10 05:06:27] WhereIsMySpoon: I imagine that would be a combination of (I assume you want to automate this) using selenium to navigate to pages then using some sort of request proxy or similar to catch all requests being made
[2014-07-10 05:06:38] WhereIsMySpoon: those are two separate things
[2014-07-10 05:06:49] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont think selenium provides anything to capture requests
[2014-07-10 05:07:23] quattr8: yeah I would need this to work on the command line with a gui running to make a screenshot of the page as well
[2014-07-10 05:07:24] p00j4: Hi
[2014-07-10 05:07:28] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-07-10 05:07:29] WhereIsMySpoon: http://blog.eviltester.com/2010/05/a-selenium-capturenetworktraffic-example-in-java.html
[2014-07-10 05:07:32] WhereIsMySpoon: try this quattr8
[2014-07-10 05:07:33] p00j4: I'm curious to know if selenium or java Http classes has some kind of handshaking which exposes a way to retrieve all post parameters of the request made on a button click
[2014-07-10 05:07:56] WhereIsMySpoon: p00j4: I think that url might help you too
[2014-07-10 05:08:01] WhereIsMySpoon: seems like you'r elooking for a similar thing to quat
[2014-07-10 05:08:19] quattr8: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks that’s exactly what im looking for :)
[2014-07-10 05:08:22] WhereIsMySpoon: dunno about just post ones, but that looks like it might capture all network traffic
[2014-07-10 05:08:37] WhereIsMySpoon: quattr8: np :)
[2014-07-10 05:09:21] WhereIsMySpoon: p00j4: you can use what that page gives you to get the json for all reuqests, then parse the json to get just the POST requests out I imagine

[2014-07-10 05:16:50] WhereIsMySpoon: ah...I guess that webdriver doesnt give this capture functionality
[2014-07-10 05:17:19] barancev: yes, it doesn't
[2014-07-10 05:17:24] WhereIsMySpoon: hm..sorry then

[2014-07-10 07:41:04] WhereIsMySpoon: which I am
[2014-07-10 07:41:06] fly2web: oh i just use selenium.
[2014-07-10 07:41:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ...
[2014-07-10 07:41:15] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is the project
[2014-07-10 07:41:20] WhereIsMySpoon: it has bindings for different languages
[2014-07-10 07:41:25] WhereIsMySpoon: which language are you using
[2014-07-10 07:41:32] fly2web: i will use python.
[2014-07-10 07:42:06] WhereIsMySpoon: ok well driver.close() is valid python
[2014-07-10 07:42:12] WhereIsMySpoon: fly2web: please paste your code like I said
[2014-07-10 07:42:45] fly2web: ok i will make it now. i use selenium instead of changing python
[2014-07-10 07:43:17] WhereIsMySpoon: fly2web: are you using the IDE?
[2014-07-10 07:43:49] fly2web: yes just selenium ide so i just write ‘driver.quit()’ in the command.
[2014-07-10 07:44:05] WhereIsMySpoon: ok in that case my first thing would be to tell you to STOP using the ide
[2014-07-10 07:44:08] WhereIsMySpoon: like I did yesterday

[2014-07-10 12:52:29] freyk: Hello, I have a question to you all. I want to promote my free graphical frontend for selenium server. Where can i do that?
[2014-07-10 12:53:18] jimevans: freyk: start with the mailing lists. i know i, for one, would want to examine it before i gave it any sort of "seal of approval".
[2014-07-10 12:53:50] andeesoft: frek: whip it out
[2014-07-10 12:53:58] freyk: https://sites.google.com/site/freykssite01/applications/testsuitestarter
[2014-07-10 12:54:21] jimevans: also, is it open-source? because if not, promoting it for me is a non-starter.
[2014-07-10 12:54:34] jimevans: in fact, i'll actively campaign against it on twitter and other social media.
[2014-07-10 12:55:05] andeesoft: jime will find you... and sit on you until you change ur mind
[2014-07-10 12:56:14] jimevans: um, no. i'm not that violent. i'll just recommend (loudly) that people not use it. and i'll tell them why. i don't know if my point of view carries much weight in the selenium community, but i'd like to think i have at least a limited influence.
[2014-07-10 12:56:40] freyk: Well, I publisched it an year ago on the mailing list but get some answers. I want to have some tips to make it better.
[2014-07-10 12:56:42] freyk: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/selenium-users/OkIBBMrAcI0/oW2zEeQGLh4J
[2014-07-10 12:58:01] jimevans: freyk: does it mainly concentrate on selenium RC? because, if so, another non-starter for me supporting and promoting it.
[2014-07-10 12:58:54] jimevans: selenium rc should be nuked from orbit, then the resulting craters firebombed.
[2014-07-10 13:00:26] freyk: Well, last year my collegaues loved my gui. I discovered a few months ago webdriver.

[2014-07-10 13:34:38] jimevans: yes. that.
[2014-07-10 13:34:52] jimevans: browser automation is a software *development* activity.
[2014-07-10 13:36:20] andeesoft: but wouldnt it be kool if we had to a tool that didnt req soft dev?
[2014-07-10 13:38:17] jimevans: there are. the history of web development is *littered* with tools that allow you to "build your own website without any code!" would you seriously trust someone who claimed to be a "developer" who relied solely on those? imagine if you hired a guy to be your expert web developer, and the first thing he did was fire up frontpage.

[2014-07-10 13:58:27] ShadowXOR:         elem.click()
[2014-07-10 13:59:00] ShadowXOR: but by using the page object model (which i already did somewhat in that code) i can reuse the code in a more short, readable format like this:
[2014-07-10 13:59:06] ShadowXOR:         login_page.go_to()
[2014-07-10 13:59:06] ShadowXOR:         login_page.enter_username(user_list['db'])
[2014-07-10 13:59:06] ShadowXOR:         login_page.sign_in()
[2014-07-10 13:59:06] ShadowXOR:         login_page.enter_password(user_list['db'])
[2014-07-10 13:59:41] ShadowXOR: now instead of rewriting the logic and code every time i just say login_page.enter_password and it does it, i just provide the user i want it to use the password for (i have users stored in a different file and pass them to it)
[2014-07-10 13:59:47] ShadowXOR: i'm still very new to this but i find the idea handy

[2014-07-10 14:00:34] andeesoft: right, under the hood, thats what my stuff like

[2014-07-10 14:02:09] andeesoft: i am not sure whats the diff. it doesnt use PageFactory or PageObjects
[2014-07-10 14:02:30] ShadowXOR: i'm not familiar with page factory but it does use page objects

[2014-07-10 14:02:44] ShadowXOR: gotcha
[2014-07-10 14:03:01] jimevans: andeesoft: the "page object" pattern does not require the use of the pagefactory class

[2014-07-10 14:11:54] jimevans: ShadowXOR: i wouldn't call your implementation a page object pattern.
[2014-07-10 14:12:04] jimevans: i'd call it a "page wrapper" pattern.
[2014-07-10 14:12:33] ShadowXOR: it's a replicate of the examples i've seen online
[2014-07-10 14:12:38] ShadowXOR: how would you say it's different
[2014-07-10 14:12:56] jimevans: and most of the examples are wrong, and fundamentally misunderstand the page object pattern
[2014-07-10 14:13:08] jimevans: in the strict interpretation of what "page objects" should be, the page object should describe "services" that the page provides.
[2014-07-10 14:13:15] ShadowXOR: then how is anyone supposed to learn anything
[2014-07-10 14:13:18] ShadowXOR: :\\
[2014-07-10 14:13:30] jimevans: not just wrapping and exposing individual elements.
[2014-07-10 14:13:48] ShadowXOR: i guess i don't follow what you mean by a service in this context
[2014-07-10 14:14:01] jimevans: what are the services of a login page?
[2014-07-10 14:14:12] jimevans: hint: it's not to type in the user name and password.
[2014-07-10 14:14:31] jimevans: what is the user using a login page to do?
[2014-07-10 14:14:59] ShadowXOR: logs in? lol
[2014-07-10 14:15:07] jimevans: exactly so.
[2014-07-10 14:15:16] ShadowXOR: so you're saying define a login functions that handles all the steps altogether providing the login service rather than the individual functions?

[2014-07-10 14:15:38] ShadowXOR: i could tweak it to do that, sounds interesting
[2014-07-10 14:15:50] jimevans: that's what the "page object" pattern is supposed to be.
[2014-07-10 14:16:13] jimevans: but most people have misinterpreted that over the years to simply wrap pages.
[2014-07-10 14:16:14] ShadowXOR: would you see the page object method is better than what you described as page wrapper?
[2014-07-10 14:16:34] ShadowXOR: would you say*
[2014-07-10 14:17:23] jimevans: consider the case where you no longer typed in the user name, but rather selected the user from a drop-down list. how would that affect the page wrapper sort of page?
[2014-07-10 14:17:24] jibran__, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-07-10 14:18:13] ShadowXOR: maybe i'm wrong, but i think you would just have to redesign the log_page.enter_username function
[2014-07-10 14:18:35] andeesoft: hackey method to do same thing
[2014-07-10 14:18:54] jimevans: if "enter_username" still accurately describes the action, and "select_username" doesn't describe it better, sure.
[2014-07-10 14:19:14] jimevans: admittedly, i'm using a contrived example to make a point
[2014-07-10 14:19:24] andeesoft: ic, i get what u r saying
[2014-07-10 14:19:34] bluescreen100, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-10 14:19:54] ShadowXOR: so there's not usually points where you need those more broken down functions, only the bigger service picture?
[2014-07-10 14:20:03] ShadowXOR: i'm genuingly asking, because ive never had a big test stuite going so im not sure what's needed more
[2014-07-10 14:20:32] jimevans: ShadowXOR: i didn't say that at all. but then again, i generally use languages that allow me to specify what methods are public and private.

[2014-07-10 14:22:03] jimevans: i'd probably still wrap the actual entry of the user name into a method, if only to allow easy refactoring. but i would mark that method as private so i could only use it within the same class.

[2014-07-10 14:28:57] ShadowXOR: So do I...soon.  Right now I mostly test fat clients but we have some web stuff and a SaaS client coming.
[2014-07-10 14:29:47] chp: ShadowXOR some channels joke around, others are pretty dry
[2014-07-10 14:29:51] ShadowXOR: Also Android, iOS, BlackBerry...a little bit of everything.
[2014-07-10 14:29:58] chp: i think this andeesoft guy is just particularly square ;)
[2014-07-10 14:30:21] ShadowXOR: lol ok cool.  i'm pretty chill and relax...and have to keep  a sense of humor when dealing with such complex stuff or i go nuts
[2014-07-10 14:30:32] ShadowXOR: especially during the learning curve
[2014-07-10 14:30:37] andeesoft: what testing famework r u using for android?
[2014-07-10 14:30:53] chp: you're prob a young american, right?
[2014-07-10 14:30:59] jimevans: no, we keep it pretty loose around here anyway.
[2014-07-10 14:31:01] ShadowXOR: Well...mostly manual testing, but we own Ranorex and are trying to get that setup to automate it, but it's easy enough manual so I've been focusing on Selenium for our SaaS product right now.
[2014-07-10 14:31:09] ShadowXOR: 29/M/California

[2014-07-10 14:31:20] smccarthy: ShadowXOR: isntead of login_page.enter_username and login_page enter password, and loginpage.signIn, you can just have login_page.sign_in_successfully(username, password) . Which will return the next page
[2014-07-10 14:31:28] jimevans: just wait until you have a day that simonstewart, lukeis, AutomatedTester, and others are all in the channel and engaged.
[2014-07-10 14:31:45] smccarthy: and login_page.sign_in_uunsuccessfully(username, password) which keeps you on the login page

[2014-07-10 14:33:26] ShadowXOR: smccarthy: Thanks I need to try that, I've heard people say it's very important to return the next page which I'm not doing yet, so I need to work on that.  would it be something like next_page.go_to() or would it be more like next_page = NextPage(driver)?
[2014-07-10 14:34:21] jimevans: no, it'd be more like next_page = login_page.login(username, password)
[2014-07-10 14:34:30] smccarthy: i just java, so after i have clickSignIn();, I have a return new HomePage(driver)
[2014-07-10 14:34:38] ShadowXOR: hmmm
[2014-07-10 14:34:41] smccarthy: and in my test, i would have just like jimevans said 2 lines ago
[2014-07-10 14:34:58] ShadowXOR: i don't quite follow how/when to return things in python yet

[2014-07-10 14:38:43] chp: andeesoft - me?
[2014-07-10 14:38:55] ShadowXOR: C# seemed fairly fun but the IDE was insanely helpful

[2014-07-10 14:39:14] ShadowXOR: andeesoft: his post is from an old version, i've already implemented his changes mostly
[2014-07-10 14:39:22] ShadowXOR: he's been helping me for a few days
[2014-07-10 14:39:25] andeesoft: our co is deciding on C# or java...
[2014-07-10 14:39:28] ShadowXOR: work has been nuts so i haven't been able to work on this stuff
[2014-07-10 14:39:31] ShadowXOR: OMG go C#
[2014-07-10 14:39:50] andeesoft: i am not particulary fond of C#
[2014-07-10 14:39:56] chp: i just python for fun
[2014-07-10 14:40:03] ShadowXOR: For being a C based language it's pretty friendly and the IDE is killer
[2014-07-10 14:40:04] chp: i really hate u guys, all bitchin abt the network
[2014-07-10 14:40:11] ShadowXOR: I want to program for ANdroid but Java is a nightmare
[2014-07-10 14:40:33] jimevans: i'm the biggest .NET apologist out there, but i would only recommend C# under very specific circumstances.
[2014-07-10 14:40:49] ShadowXOR: Well, if you're making Windows apps is my reference, sorry.
[2014-07-10 14:40:52] ShadowXOR: I don't know how it works for other situations
[2014-07-10 14:41:14] chp: whole credit card gateway build in asp.net at my last gig
[2014-07-10 14:41:14] andeesoft: we were going to use xamerian(sp?), but we couldnt get it to work on our win boxes and had to use VS+resharper
[2014-07-10 14:41:22] chp: what a nightmare
[2014-07-10 14:41:25] andeesoft: but VS+resharper = $500+/user
[2014-07-10 14:41:41] ShadowXOR: my place the higher ups are obsessed with microsoft
[2014-07-10 14:41:48] ShadowXOR: so it's almost impossible to get anything else here
[2014-07-10 14:41:59] andeesoft: me too.. it so silly. java = free everything
[2014-07-10 14:42:02] ShadowXOR: right now i'm trying to convince them to use python and selenium for our automated tests rather than a test client + C#
[2014-07-10 14:42:33] jimevans: ShadowXOR: if they're dead-set on C#, you can still use selenium, you know.
[2014-07-10 14:42:54] ShadowXOR: jimevans: well it's more about the tool they bought vs. selenium than python vs. C#, but that is part of it
[2014-07-10 14:44:23] jimevans: well, all i can say is that the selenium dev team in general, and the .net bindings maintainer in particular, have worked very hard to make sure the .NET languages (including C#) are first-class citizens when it comes to using webdriver.
[2014-07-10 14:44:42] andeesoft: jim... but are they? are they really?
[2014-07-10 14:45:21] jimevans: andeesoft: can you point to where they're not? :)
[2014-07-10 14:45:31] ShadowXOR: does python work well with web driver?
[2014-07-10 14:45:48] ShadowXOR: it seems decently documented
[2014-07-10 14:45:51] jimevans: ShadowXOR: yes, python is one of the Big Four.
[2014-07-10 14:46:48] andeesoft: jim: what stuff do they usually use for CI c# seleneium? VS+ReShaper>NUnit>Bamboo?
[2014-07-10 14:47:20] jimevans: i suppose i should really call it the Big Five, but as long as the javascript community continues to suffer from not-invented-here-syndrome because of proliferating language bindings, i can't take it seriously.
[2014-07-10 14:47:40] jimevans: andeesoft: who's "they"? .net developers? they can use any number of things.
[2014-07-10 14:47:49] ShadowXOR: what do you guys think the best bug tracking software is?
[2014-07-10 14:47:58] andeesoft: general c# selenium community?
[2014-07-10 14:48:16] jimevans: nunit is very popular for unit testing. i'd say jenkins is probably more common than bamboo for actual CI
[2014-07-10 14:48:18] andeesoft: sha, free?
[2014-07-10 14:48:45] ShadowXOR: jenkins is free
