[2014-06-17 09:14:33] xproj: hi all
[2014-06-17 09:15:37] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-17 09:15:59] xproj: does someone know when Selenium RC mode will be deprecated in selenium 2, if it will be?
[2014-06-17 09:16:11] dimacus: i think it will be in selenium 3
[2014-06-17 09:16:15] dimacus: that's last i heard
[2014-06-17 09:16:33] xproj: deprecated or delete?
[2014-06-17 09:16:40] dimacus: deleted
[2014-06-17 09:16:43] xproj: ah
[2014-06-17 09:16:44] jimevans: it will be deprecated in selenium 3. moved to a separate download
[2014-06-17 09:17:15] xproj: ...
[2014-06-17 09:17:59] xproj: in what language do you suggest to program?
[2014-06-17 09:18:14] jimevans: the selenium 3 effort will begin in earnest when the :spec goes to last call
[2014-06-17 09:18:14] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/ | bugs: http://goo.gl/LxCtcV
[2014-06-17 09:18:14] xproj: Now i'm using php
[2014-06-17 09:19:51] jimevans: php is fine, but it's not one with language bindings for webdriver built by the project. you'll need to use one of the (myriad) php bindings for the webdriver api.
[2014-06-17 09:20:25] jimevans: don't ask me which one. i don't know, and don't care. haven't ever touched php; don't intend to start now.
[2014-06-17 09:20:54] bimmelino: since the test object is written in php, i have to implement the tests in php as well
[2014-06-17 09:21:41] bimmelino: i work with the mink framework http://mink.behat.org/
[2014-06-17 09:22:00] xproj: i saw mink
[2014-06-17 09:22:01] bimmelino: but i would recommend java if you have the choice
[2014-06-17 09:22:15] xproj: but never used....
[2014-06-17 09:22:17] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-17 09:22:26] jimevans: i wouldn't recommend java right off.
[2014-06-17 09:22:48] *jimevans is really tired of the perception that "webdriver is java first, and all others are second-class citizens"'
[2014-06-17 09:23:34] xproj: @jimevans do you use other languages?
[2014-06-17 09:23:35] almostwhitehat, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-06-17 09:24:00] jimevans: i use c# with regularity. i've used python and ruby. currently i get paid to use java with webdriver.

[2014-06-17 09:24:26] JamesPrescott: Another C# guy here *waves*
[2014-06-17 09:24:42] xproj: my problem is that php has not an official client
[2014-06-17 09:25:05] jimevans: if there's something that's not implemented in one of the language bindings provided by the project that is provided by others, there's usually a pretty good reason.
[2014-06-17 09:25:26] xproj: i should chose between php and Java
[2014-06-17 09:25:32] jimevans: xproj: why is that a problem?
[2014-06-17 09:25:46] jimevans: there are plenty (too many, imo) of options in the php world.
[2014-06-17 09:26:05] xproj: I have two fears
[2014-06-17 09:26:21] jimevans: the api to which one must conform for a language binding is pretty well defined.
[2014-06-17 09:26:24] xproj: one is regarding rc mode I'm using now
[2014-06-17 09:26:39] jimevans: xproj: i'd move off of rc as rapidly as humanly possible.
[2014-06-17 09:26:47] ato: jimevans: +1 re. Java first and others second.
[2014-06-17 09:26:49] xproj: ah:)

[2014-06-17 09:27:19] xproj: @jimevans should I consider RC the EVIL??!!!
[2014-06-17 09:27:19] jimevans: but that's mostly because i abhor the RC api, and wish i could nuke it from orbit, so completely that i could change history, and have it never have been invented in the first place.
[2014-06-17 09:27:48] ato: xproj: You should consider that there is no active development going into it, and no developers on the core team using it.
[2014-06-17 09:27:51] jimevans: xproj: no, it's not "evil" per se. i just hate the api.
[2014-06-17 09:28:10] xproj: ...
[2014-06-17 09:28:14] xproj: I know
[2014-06-17 09:28:21] jimevans: it's ugly. as a developer who understands object-oriented programming, i find it incredibly inelegant.
[2014-06-17 09:28:54] xproj: so... the first thing that I must do is pass to webdriver?
[2014-06-17 09:29:03] xproj: is so?
[2014-06-17 09:29:25] JamesPrescott, quitting. (Quit: Logging off)
[2014-06-17 09:29:45] xproj: passing
[2014-06-17 09:31:06] jimevans: i mean, really. a single god-object that contains over 150 methods? with no rhyme or reason as to their organization? kill me now, please.
[2014-06-17 09:31:54] xproj: ok jim:)
[2014-06-17 09:31:56] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-06-17 09:32:02] xproj: I read on google forum that rc mode will be deleted in the future
[2014-06-17 09:32:18] jimevans: xproj: it will be.
[2014-06-17 09:32:33] xproj: my problem is that I have 7000 rows of code in rc
[2014-06-17 09:32:33] jimevans: but i'd expect the actual "delete" of it will be awhile off.
[2014-06-17 09:32:57] jimevans: and *that's* why it'll be "deprecated" for awhile before being "deleted"
[2014-06-17 09:33:24] jimevans: right. lunchtime.

[2014-06-17 14:37:51] barancev: lukeis: there is also getCoordinates().inViewPort()
[2014-06-17 14:37:54] ato: The situation is worse on desktop because browsers style the borders.
[2014-06-17 14:38:12] lukeis: you can in mobile too ;)
[2014-06-17 14:38:17] ato: In a very ad-hoc way depending on platform.

[2014-06-17 14:38:29] *ato goes away and hides'
[2014-06-17 14:38:56] AutomatedTester: ato: face it... face it head on
[2014-06-17 14:39:34] barancev: and... there is getCoordinates().onScreen() that never was implemented ever :)
[2014-06-17 14:40:28] AutomatedTester: I suspect that maybe be asked for by MS but you can do that easily with getClientBoundingRect()
[2014-06-17 14:40:52] barancev: btw, why Locatable interface is in "internal" package?
[2014-06-17 14:41:18] ato: In Java?  Simon knows.
[2014-06-17 14:41:26] barancev: in Java, yes
[2014-06-17 14:41:54] AutomatedTester: Because role  based...
[2014-06-17 14:42:00] AutomatedTester: isnt that always the answer?
[2014-06-17 14:42:44] barancev: I heard this answer...
[2014-06-17 14:42:59] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 835
[2014-06-17 14:43:54] barancev: but it does not explain why this interface is considered "internal"
[2014-06-17 14:44:24] AutomatedTester: *shrug*
[2014-06-17 14:44:28] AutomatedTester: because Java?
[2014-06-17 14:45:25] ato: So getCoordinates is for screen and getLocation for document in the context of Java.
[2014-06-17 14:45:45] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS if you werent already aware
[2014-06-17 14:46:13] ato: barancev: I wonder if the explanation is simply “we couldn't fine a way to implement it reliably”.
[2014-06-17 14:46:55] barancev: ato: getCoordinates() is a facade for three methods that (should) return coordinates relative to 1) page, 2) viewport (browser window), 3) screen
[2014-06-17 14:47:24] AutomatedTester: 3) ?
[2014-06-17 14:47:35] AutomatedTester: why would anyone care about 3)
[2014-06-17 14:47:37] ato: I thought it was getBoundingClientRect?
[2014-06-17 14:47:49] almostwhitehat, quitting. (Quit: almostwhitehat)
[2014-06-17 14:47:50] AutomatedTester: 2) is done by getBoundClientRect
[2014-06-17 14:48:03] ato: Yeah.
[2014-06-17 14:48:22] AutomatedTester: and 1) needs to be calculated using scrollX/scrollY + getBoundingClientRect
[2014-06-17 14:48:26] AutomatedTester: simples
[2014-06-17 14:48:39] barancev: AutomatedTester: I told onScreen has never been implemented. nobody cares, you're right

[2014-06-17 14:49:27] ato: So what I did in OperaDriver was to take the bounding client rect and subtract the left-window and top-window's pageXOffset and pageYOffset.
[2014-06-17 14:49:46] ato: But I have no idea if that's the right implementation.  Because back then the docs were even worse than they are today.
