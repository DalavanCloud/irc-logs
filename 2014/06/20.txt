[2014-06-20 07:06:00] garndt: use a language you know first, then you can change languages if you feel one is better suited for your needs

[2014-06-20 07:18:53] ato: So I think Selenium is quite easy to pick up in itself, but you have to realize it's not meant for all types of testing.
[2014-06-20 07:19:19] ato: Running Selenium tests are expensive so they should be your last resort, but they are also very powerful.
[2014-06-20 07:20:26] garndt: it might help answering your questions if we knew what your testing responsibilities are

[2014-06-20 07:28:19] geeni: my responsibilities are data flow testing
[2014-06-20 07:28:48] garndt: well, from what you've explained, I'm not sure how selenium would help with this.  Is there a web frontend to this that is going to be tested?
[2014-06-20 07:29:55] garndt: Or not necessarily tested, but interacted with?
[2014-06-20 07:29:59] geeni: well this is not web based app this a tool in networking which automates the flow of network
[2014-06-20 07:30:49] geeni: it is some what related with web
[2014-06-20 07:30:53] zzebelzz, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-20 07:31:30] geeni: as the flow of date from server to client must be controlled
[2014-06-20 07:32:33] geeni: it may be interanet or internet
[2014-06-20 07:32:46] garndt: Well selenium is used to simulate user actions with the context of a browser. I do not think this is the kind if tool you would need for what you've described
[2014-06-20 07:33:11] geeni: ok
[2014-06-20 07:34:02] geeni: so we cannot test the routers , switches etc.

[2014-06-20 07:49:33] numdig: no since the crawler accesses a website, there is no user involved, therefore there is nothing for selenium to be involved with either ( since selenium is like a robot that acts like a user - using the mouse and the keyboard )
[2014-06-20 07:51:05] numdig: no, what you need is something like "wget.exe" (the simplest but maybe the least powerfull), "curl.exe" (famous and capable) ... or more sophisticated tools such as the microsoft performance testing utilities, or something analog in the open source world ( eg. "jmeter", etc. )

[2014-06-20 09:01:18] detronizator: jarib: yep - that solved the issue
[2014-06-20 09:01:49] detronizator: the issue is that maximize() has nothing to ask "what's the max size I can get" if no WinMan is active

[2014-06-20 09:53:13] garndt: zzb12: it really seems that your questions are more about python than anything.  There are some amazing resources out there for learning python that will help with accomplishing what you need.

[2014-06-20 09:53:37] garndt: zzb12: That being said, what you're proposing "name" will contain a list, and not an individual element because your'e calling "find elements_*"
[2014-06-20 09:54:14] jleyba: jimevans: Does MS have any documentation of what features in WebDriver have been implemented? Or do they support everything that's already in the spec
[2014-06-20 09:54:26] jimevans: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn722336%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[2014-06-20 09:54:31] jimevans: jleyba: ^^
[2014-06-20 09:54:41] jimevans: there's quite a bit that's not yet implemented.
[2014-06-20 09:54:45] zzb12: garndt: oh, so that's why it's not working the way i re-wrote it
[2014-06-20 09:54:49] jimevans: which is why i haven't pushed harder.
[2014-06-20 09:55:39] zzb12: garndt: can i do something like name = name.text and then print name later? or is that the same thing
[2014-06-20 09:56:54] garndt: name will be a list, you need to iterate over it
[2014-06-20 09:57:17] garndt: you can store the elements in a list like your'e doing, but at the point where you want the "text", then you need to iterate over it
[2014-06-20 09:57:56] zzb12: what does 'iterate over it' mean?
[2014-06-20 09:59:07] garndt: well this goes back to my suggestion that perhaps you spend some time in learning python

I'm trying to pinpoint a unique failure that is happening where I get a "Connection is reset" page between the application under test (port 7001) and the browser. Would it be possible that one of these ports opened up between the selenium server and httpd would snag that port?

[2014-06-20 12:31:25] jimevans: AutomatedTester: hey. i was just perusing some spec things and had a couple of questions.
[2014-06-20 12:31:40] jimevans: like isEnabled doesn't appear to be there.
[2014-06-20 12:31:49] AutomatedTester: doh
[2014-06-20 12:32:06] *AutomatedTester loads up his bug list quickly'
[2014-06-20 12:32:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: please raise a bug to get it documented
[2014-06-20 12:33:05] jimevans: i've been playing about with the MSFT implementation, which is strictly adhering to the spec. needless to say, the current implementation (and language bindings) don't necessarily align.
[2014-06-20 12:33:37] ato: I've been discovering the same.
[2014-06-20 12:33:47] ato: When working with Marionette compat issues.
[2014-06-20 12:34:20] *AutomatedTester warned people this would happen...'
[2014-06-20 12:34:32] AutomatedTester: but the spec is what we want and where we want to be
[2014-06-20 12:34:33] ato: I think the best client binding you can use to test it right now is the one done by Marc Fischer which is in the wpt repo.
[2014-06-20 12:35:01] ato: That should be adapter to be compatible with the MS implementation.
[2014-06-20 12:35:07] ato: s/adapter/adapted/
[2014-06-20 12:36:22] jimevans: ato: that doesn't really help with what i've been trying to do, which is integrate their driver into the existing IEDriverServer.exe.
[2014-06-20 12:36:52] ato: Why's that necessary?
[2014-06-20 12:36:54] jimevans: their driver doesn't implement an http shim; the oss project executable does that.
[2014-06-20 12:37:03] jimevans: strictly speaking, it's not necessary.
[2014-06-20 12:37:23] AutomatedTester: jimevans: have they not given a shim?
[2014-06-20 12:37:24] ato: I was about to say, isn't it better to do that for each client binding language?
[2014-06-20 12:37:36] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not with their alpha release, no.
[2014-06-20 12:37:57] jimevans: i think they're hoping to leverage the oss project as the http shim.
[2014-06-20 12:37:58] *AutomatedTester mutters about the only people asking for it to be normative dont ship with it '
[2014-06-20 12:38:00] jimevans: which is fine.
[2014-06-20 12:39:31] jimevans: ato: it's actually not that hard to have the existing server executable act as the server for *all* versions of IE, and instantiate the proper driver implementation when it's appropriate. that's a pretty compelling user story too, if you ask me.
[2014-06-20 12:40:36] jimevans: the biggest issue is aligning the existing IE driver implementation (the oss one) with the spec, because neither it, nor the current language bindings conform.
[2014-06-20 12:41:07] jimevans: and sure, if you want to do COM object programming from python to create your own MSFT-based IE driver, i'm not going to stop you.
[2014-06-20 12:41:27] jimevans: (or ruby, or java)
[2014-06-20 12:41:40] ato: I see, if it's exposed as COM that's a good reason not to do it from every language.
[2014-06-20 12:41:55] jimevans: ato: it currently is implemented as a COM object.
[2014-06-20 12:41:59] ato: And also incidentally why we ended up saying HTTP-over-JSON being normative.
[2014-06-20 12:42:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we used to do COM from python
[2014-06-20 12:42:42] jimevans: and what i'm saying is that i'm perfectly happy collaborating with our friends in redmond to provide the json-over-http interface.
[2014-06-20 12:42:51] AutomatedTester: oh how we laughed during those days

[2014-06-20 12:45:55] jimevans: AutomatedTester: also, concerning sendKeys and the interactions API. there are no keyboard low-level methods defined. oversight?
[2014-06-20 12:46:12] AutomatedTester: probably

[2014-06-20 13:03:33] jimevans: AutomatedTester: the other thing was that in the spec, an element description is { "id": "<element id>" }. is there any particular reason that was changed from the current implementations which is { "ELEMENT": "<element id>" }? i only ask because i could see returning stuff from a javascript operation, it might be more likely to have a serialized object with a property named "id" than it is to have a property named "ELEMENT".
[2014-06-20 13:04:28] DDR_new, quitting. (Quit:)
[2014-06-20 13:04:42] jimevans: from a language binding perspective, i see it possible to generate false-positives that the object returned by your javascript function is an element reference when it shouldn't be (or vice-versa)
[2014-06-20 13:05:26] AutomatedTester: jimevans: what section?

[2014-06-20 13:11:33] AutomatedTester: that some <undefined> language my conflate the 2?
[2014-06-20 13:12:12] jimevans: give me a second. i'll post an example. it'll be java, but the same is true of c#, and i suspect the same would be for any language.

[2014-06-20 14:32:27] jleyba: bbark123: Using Selenium RC?
[2014-06-20 14:33:12] jleyba: Selenium Core (the actual automation library under Selenium RC) is a JavaScript application, so it has to use a proxy to get around the same origin policy
[2014-06-20 14:34:54] AutomatedTester: jleyba: ato and I were discussing how awesome it would be not to have getAttribute conflate properties and attributes

[2014-06-20 14:43:33] LocusAsaf: should webdriver be able to locate elements that have display:none attribute?
[2014-06-20 14:43:39] jleyba: yes
[2014-06-20 14:43:47] jleyba: presence in the DOM is unrelated to visibility
[2014-06-20 14:44:47] LocusAsaf: jleyba: I thought that the webdriver was only allowed to interact with things that were actually visible on the page
[2014-06-20 14:45:21] jleyba: Yes, where interact means click, keypress, etc.
[2014-06-20 14:45:36] LocusAsaf: so you can locate them but you cannot click on them?
[2014-06-20 14:45:41] jleyba: You can make queries about any element present in the DOM
[2014-06-20 14:45:47] jleyba: Yup

[2014-06-20 15:55:40] LocusAsaf: oh I see, the default is half a second
[2014-06-20 15:57:13] LocusAsaf: so what's the distinct advantage to the driver wait vs just writing a function that sleep loops for x seconds?
[2014-06-20 15:57:23] LocusAsaf: just out of curiousity
[2014-06-20 16:00:37] ato: So it provides some checks for exceptions that might be thrown, and ignores e.g. element not found by default.
[2014-06-20 16:01:12] ato: You can also configure it to ignore a set of exceptions.
[2014-06-20 16:01:44] ato: You can also plug in your own condition predicates and use it as a service for expected condition functions you write yourself.
[2014-06-20 16:01:53] ato: (Mostly like anonymous functions or lambdas.)
[2014-06-20 16:02:22] ato: So you can e.g. do Wait(driver).until(element_is_visible(el)).
[2014-06-20 16:02:39] ato: Where element_is_visible is a helper function you can reuse.
