[2014-06-25 07:31:40] abotalov: There is a "SearchPage" page object. This page can be opened either via direct url "/search?q=#{query}" or via filling "query" into some field and clicking "Search" button. So "query" is a state of page object that other methods may probably need to know about. So it makes sense for SearchPage to have a constructor that takes query as a parameter (instead of "load(query)"/"searchFor(query)"). Do you agree?

[2014-06-25 07:37:15] abotalov: Also search page for another query is clearly an another page (with a different set of results, etc.). So query should be an argument of constructor.

[2014-06-25 11:15:04] barancev|2: nirvdrum_: you can know the "correct" answer, because this comparison is used mostly on the hub to match a node
[2014-06-25 11:16:18] nirvdrum_: barancev|2: No. All squares are rectangles, not all rectangles are squares.
[2014-06-25 11:16:44] barancev|2: yes, but.. why  WINDOWS.is(VISTA) does return true atm ?
[2014-06-25 11:16:54] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-25 11:16:55] barancev|2: it must be implemented this way for a reason :)
[2014-06-25 11:17:09] nirvdrum_: That one is probably a bug.  I dunno.
[2014-06-25 11:18:00] nirvdrum_: It may have been that we just use the latest version of windows as an alias.
[2014-06-25 11:18:14] nirvdrum_: simonstewart would probably the be guy to answer that.

[2014-06-25 11:19:39] barancev|2: or, the original question was "should Platform.is method be symmetric?"
[2014-06-25 11:19:43] simonstewart: VISTA.is(WINDOWS) should return true
[2014-06-25 11:19:54] barancev|2: right
[2014-06-25 11:19:57] simonstewart: Because vista is a version of windows
[2014-06-25 11:20:10] barancev|2: what WINDOWS.is(VISTA) should return?
[2014-06-25 11:20:23] simonstewart: VISTA is a kind of windows

[2014-06-25 11:21:53] nirvdrum_: simonstewart: He's asking about the inverse.  Apparently WINDOWS.is(VISTA) evaluates to true.
[2014-06-25 11:22:06] nirvdrum_: Was that intentional?  Or just a bug?
[2014-06-25 11:22:14] simonstewart: It’s both true and false
[2014-06-25 11:22:30] simonstewart: Because Vista is a version of windows
[2014-06-25 11:22:43] nirvdrum_: No disagreement on that point.
[2014-06-25 11:22:57] barancev|2: dimacus: #5051

[2014-06-25 11:23:02] simonstewart: So either answer would be correct

[2014-06-25 11:24:00] dimacus: barancev|2: i'm gonna take a guess that it's not availble for safari
[2014-06-25 11:24:07] dimacus: until that bug is fixed, eh?
[2014-06-25 11:24:31] nirvdrum_: dimacus: MacOS doesn't have a way to set the proxy just for the browser.  It needs to be system-wide, FYI.
[2014-06-25 11:25:24] dimacus: hmmm ok i think i can work with that :)
[2014-06-25 11:25:26] nirvdrum_: barancev|2: According to the comment, it's intentional "Never returned, but can be used to request a browser running on any version of Windows."

[2014-06-25 11:38:59] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-25 11:39:28] jleyba: b/c not all Unix variants are Linux distros
[2014-06-25 11:39:29] barancev|2: jleyba: if LINUX is more general, should I expecta solaris node to accept a request when I want LINUX?
[2014-06-25 11:41:24] barancev|2: I thought LINUX is nore restrictive than UNIX, it should allow only LINUX nodes and disallow other flavours of unices
[2014-06-25 11:42:00] jleyba: oh wait...i got that backwards. Asking for UNIX should match on LINUX
[2014-06-25 11:42:20] jleyba: LINUX.is(UNIX) == true; UNIX.is(LINUX) == false
[2014-06-25 11:42:59] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 828
[2014-06-25 11:43:25] nirvdrum_: It seems to be defined as solaris and bsd, which are actually unix.  Linux technically isn't.  I don't know if the distinction really matters here.
[2014-06-25 11:43:42] JasmeetQA, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-06-25 11:44:03] jleyba: should we just have a POSIX platform?

[2014-06-25 11:44:25] nirvdrum_: And NT4!
[2014-06-25 11:44:58] nirvdrum_: It might make sense.  But I kinda come back to my original question of whether this is practically a problem.
[2014-06-25 11:45:08] barancev|2: LINUX.is(UNIX) == true; UNIX.is(LINUX) == false -- that's what I'm ready to agree with
[2014-06-25 11:45:16] barancev|2: but why not the same for windows?

[2014-06-25 11:47:01] barancev|2: nirvdrum_: the practical problem is that when I have a linux node and a solaris node, and when I request a LINUX session it matches both nodes
[2014-06-25 11:47:21] nirvdrum_: barancev|2: Gotcha.  That's what I was asking about :-)
[2014-06-25 11:47:23] nirvdrum_: Thanks.
[2014-06-25 11:47:48] nirvdrum_: Asking for a Linux node should never match Solaris.

[2014-06-25 11:48:27] jleyba: barancev|2: so you want WINDOWS.is(VISTA)? So you could ask for generic WINDOWS and get any random flavor registered?
[2014-06-25 11:49:07] nirvdrum_: That's how it currently work.  Changing that would break several grids I'm aware of.
