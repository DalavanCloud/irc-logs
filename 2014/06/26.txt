[2014-06-26 06:22:29] jimevans: Zoddie: because using a firefox profile, even the default one is a two-step process.
[2014-06-26 06:23:13] Brando753, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-26 06:23:14] jimevans: the driver creates a copy of the profile in the tmp directory (so as to allow multiple instances of firefox to be executed by the driver simultaneously).

[2014-06-26 06:23:59] jimevans: the driver executes with the -silent switch to force firefox to attempt to load it, and clean it up so that it *is* a 100% valid profile.
[2014-06-26 06:24:14] Zoddie: I kill it because it's silent and not visible via Gui.
[2014-06-26 06:24:26] Zoddie: oh ok jimevans
[2014-06-26 06:24:35] jimevans: then launches firefox "for realsies" with the window visible, loading that profile, and allowing the driver to automate it.
[2014-06-26 06:25:21] garndt: "for realsies"...I love that
[2014-06-26 06:25:26] Zoddie: How do you suggest I get it to load for realsies, because atm each time I "Run" the test, it does -silent until I manually kill -silent to invoke the realsies
[2014-06-26 06:26:11] Zoddie: and as u said
[2014-06-26 06:26:13] jimevans: the silent load *should* be exiting on its own. you shouldn't have to kill it.
[2014-06-26 06:26:15] Zoddie: i guess its because the tmp directory
[2014-06-26 06:26:24] Zoddie: OK i'll try to give it more time
[2014-06-26 06:26:26] Zoddie: and let you know
[2014-06-26 06:27:11] barancev: how long do you wait until you kill it?
[2014-06-26 06:27:48] Zoddie: Also, I get a Firefox <defunct> process as well
[2014-06-26 06:27:58] Zoddie: May I post the two lines of code I'm using to load the profile
[2014-06-26 06:28:11] jimevans: Zoddie: sure. use :gist or similar.

[2014-06-26 06:31:25] Zoddie: deleted it
[2014-06-26 06:32:06] Zoddie: jimevans: Let me know what you think, not sure if you code Java
[2014-06-26 06:32:36] jimevans: i do, but i'm not an expert with what firefox may be doing there. i'm not sure i can offer much more help; i'm pretty swamped at the moment.
[2014-06-26 06:32:56] barancev: looks corect. how long do you wait until you kill it?
[2014-06-26 06:33:02] Zoddie: Not a problem!
[2014-06-26 06:33:08] Zoddie: well i've had it running since i told you guys i'd test it
[2014-06-26 06:33:16] barancev: and, btw, do you really need to copy an existing profile? it can be big enough
[2014-06-26 06:33:43] Zoddie: and still only have running "dwebdriver.firefox.profile" junit runner, firefox -silent and firefox <defunct>
[2014-06-26 06:34:17] Zoddie: when i kill the -silent, the automation test starts for realsies
[2014-06-26 06:34:28] Zoddie: Copy an existing profile,
[2014-06-26 06:34:37] Zoddie: i need to do that due to greasemonkey loading javascripts i require

[2014-06-26 06:37:23] WhereIsMySpoon: Is there a system property I can set to let selenium know where my firefox binaryis?
[2014-06-26 06:37:41] WhereIsMySpoon: binary is*
[2014-06-26 06:37:41] barancev: Zoddie: no you can't :)
[2014-06-26 06:37:50] Zoddie: FirefoxBinary binary = new FirefoxBinary();
[2014-06-26 06:37:54] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: use FirefoxBinary class
[2014-06-26 06:38:00] Zoddie: webDriver = new FirefoxDriver(binary);
[2014-06-26 06:38:16] WhereIsMySpoon: there is no constructor with that signature
[2014-06-26 06:38:37] WhereIsMySpoon: is this new?
[2014-06-26 06:38:42] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: in java?
[2014-06-26 06:38:49] WhereIsMySpoon: im on 2.39
[2014-06-26 06:38:50] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2014-06-26 06:38:56] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: driver = new FirefoxDriver(binary, new FirefoxProfile());
[2014-06-26 06:39:23] WhereIsMySpoon: aha
[2014-06-26 06:39:25] Zoddie: barancev: I am thinking that it has to do with a tmp file location you guys mentioned
[2014-06-26 06:39:47] WhereIsMySpoon: how come I dont need to do this for chrome?
[2014-06-26 06:39:52] WhereIsMySpoon: chrome isnt on my %path%
[2014-06-26 06:40:05] barancev: Zoddie: can you run the tests with the empty profile?
[2014-06-26 06:40:17] WhereIsMySpoon: or rather, how come i *do* need to do it for firefox i guess
[2014-06-26 06:40:35] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: where is firefox installed?
[2014-06-26 06:40:46] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: the same location as chrome, appdata/local
[2014-06-26 06:40:49] numdig: chrome and IE use an external process that does the driver. you only need to know the path to that project, and they willprobably look for standard locations
[2014-06-26 06:40:52] barancev: Zoddie: or, can you start a new browser with an empty profile
[2014-06-26 06:40:56] barancev: just to ensure Firefox can start and the issue is related to the existing profile
[2014-06-26 06:41:08] numdig: whereas FF is using an emedded Driver
[2014-06-26 06:41:14] rodrigomartin, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-26 06:41:22] Zoddie: ok i'll run the "firefox -P" and select another profile
[2014-06-26 06:41:27] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: you've installed firefox to appdata/local? that's not the default location.
[2014-06-26 06:41:40] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: not my choice
[2014-06-26 06:41:42] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-06-26 06:42:02] jimevans: but then, that'd be why you need it. non-default location.
[2014-06-26 06:42:11] WhereIsMySpoon: but surely that isnt default for chrome?>
[2014-06-26 06:42:13] Zoddie: default profile, and a custom profile both load on command barancev
[2014-06-26 06:42:28] Zoddie: it must be related to how it is called within eclipse
[2014-06-26 06:42:29] WhereIsMySpoon: does the chromedriver do some extra searching or something?
[2014-06-26 06:42:32] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: on windows? yeah, i'm pretty sure it is.
[2014-06-26 06:42:36] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-06-26 06:42:37] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-06-26 06:42:47] WhereIsMySpoon: well i guess that's that then
[2014-06-26 06:42:47] barancev: Zoddie: I mean, with Selenium, driver = new FirefoxDriver() -- does it start?

[2014-06-26 06:44:03] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: you need to supply the FirefoxBinary constructor with the path to firefox.exe.

[2014-06-26 07:36:53] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: what if to download the file, i needed to put some stuff into teh app, and if you dont put the right stuff in it, it doesnt download it

[2014-06-26 07:38:13] WhereIsMySpoon: i need the file save popup to stop appearing
[2014-06-26 07:38:16] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: the popup will happen unless and until you set that preference.

[2014-06-26 07:39:28] jimevans: i just don't understand why people insist on trying to download files, insisting that's something required.
[2014-06-26 07:39:31] jimevans: it's not. full stop.
[2014-06-26 07:39:34] jimevans: there are better ways.
[2014-06-26 07:39:41] barancev: also set browser.download.dir
[2014-06-26 07:40:00] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: such as?
[2014-06-26 07:40:00] barancev: to make sure it is set to a dir that does exist
[2014-06-26 07:40:35] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: already said. examine the element you'd click to download the file. verify it points to a valid url location.
[2014-06-26 07:40:52] jimevans: this is particularly true if you don't care about the contents of the file.

[2014-06-26 07:41:28] WhereIsMySpoon: what if the url is valid but the file server is dead
[2014-06-26 07:41:38] barancev: yes, but it not part of UI testing, that's what Selenium is intended for
[2014-06-26 07:41:39] WhereIsMySpoon: that would be a thing I would want to knoiw about if im running my tests
[2014-06-26 07:41:49] jimevans: how do you know it's valid? if the file server is dead, it's not a valid url.
[2014-06-26 07:42:24] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, so I test its a valid url by just calling it and testing the response
[2014-06-26 07:42:32] jimevans: bingo.
[2014-06-26 07:42:51] WhereIsMySpoon: what if the fileserver is broken somehow and doesnt give you the file even if its giving you back an OK
[2014-06-26 07:43:00] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 830
[2014-06-26 07:43:28] jimevans: how would you know that through the browser? that would involve validating the file contents.
[2014-06-26 07:43:30] WhereIsMySpoon: iunno maybe someone broke something in the main app to stop it accepting that particular file type
[2014-06-26 07:43:35] WhereIsMySpoon: no it wouldnt
[2014-06-26 07:43:41] WhereIsMySpoon: it involvse checking the file exists
[2014-06-26 07:43:44] barancev: check the fileserver availability with more appropriate tools
[2014-06-26 07:43:45] WhereIsMySpoon: that is it
[2014-06-26 07:44:16] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: respectfully, i disagree, but i can see i'm going to be entirely unable to convince you otherwise, so i'm bowing out of this conversation.
[2014-06-26 07:44:46] Zoddie: WhereIsMySpoon: i found something called updateUserPrefs which might pertain to ur issue
[2014-06-26 07:45:03] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: Sorry if I seem stubborn, but I dont see how "check that the url gives back an OK" is the same as "check that the url gives you a file"
[2014-06-26 07:45:04] Zoddie: within firefoxProfile
[2014-06-26 07:45:04] barancev: actually, I do use Selenium to test file downloading too. but I use a proxy to handle file downloading, and the proxy just reports to the browser that all is OK
[2014-06-26 07:45:30] barancev: no file dialogs, no file content in the browser
[2014-06-26 07:46:10] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: the act of "checking the URL gives an OK" will give you an http response. that http response will tell you everything you need to know about whether it's a file, or an error page, or whatever.
[2014-06-26 07:46:29] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-06-26 07:46:35] jimevans: because mime types

[2014-06-26 07:52:53] WhereIsMySpoon: oh ffs
[2014-06-26 07:53:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ofc the button to do the download is a javascript call

[2014-06-26 08:17:38] jimevans: brockfredin: you also need to make sure the exe is in the directory you think it's in. depending on how you run your tests, it may not be at that relative path. additionally, the .NET bindings expect the path *without* the file name.

[2014-06-26 08:22:10] jimevans: brockfredin: i bet one of two things is happening. either the working directory of the executing process isn't what you think it is, meaning the relative path isn't correct; or the passing of the executable name ('chromedriver.exe') in the constructor is throwing it off.

[2014-06-26 08:57:26] jimevans: the whole "name of the driver executable" thing is because in your initial statement here in the channel you said you were attempting to use 'ChromeDriver(@"..\\..\\AcceptanceTests\\SolutionName\\lib\chromedriver.exe")'. that's copied and pasted from your earlier statement, and *does*, in fact, have the name of the executable in it. :)

[2014-06-26 10:45:14] brockfredin: jimevans I am trying and read every word.  Is there a solution to this relative path issue?  I'm a visual learner.
[2014-06-26 10:46:14] jimevans: i believe you that the relative paths of your assembly where you're instantiating chrome driver and the chromedriver.exe are correct. however, when your assembly and the webdriver assembly get loaded into memory, the current directory *of* *that* *process* may *NOT* be the directory where the assembly is stored on disk. which means the relative path is no longer correct.
[2014-06-26 10:48:04] dude-x: how do you deal with element not focused when using chrome?
[2014-06-26 10:48:46] brockfredin: jimevans So I'll probably have to use a config with variables that instantiate an absolute path for each individual system?
[2014-06-26 10:48:47] dude-x: "cannot focus element"
[2014-06-26 10:48:55] jimevans: brockfredin: nope. not at all.
[2014-06-26 10:49:08] jimevans: you could, but there's no need.

[2014-06-26 10:51:27] dude-x:   looks like the US blew it again
[2014-06-26 10:51:40] dude-x: and again
[2014-06-26 10:52:50] brockfredin: They just had two golden chances
[2014-06-26 10:52:55] jimevans: dude-x: doesn't matter. the US is advancing anyway.

[2014-06-26 10:55:04] jimevans: the USA and POR both finish the group stage with 4 points, but USA advances on the strength of the first tie-breaker (goal differential)
[2014-06-26 10:55:36] brockfredin: Kind of cheap.  They should be out.

[2014-06-26 10:56:32] jimevans: why? they have an identical record to portugal, and head-to-head, they drew. on what basis do you say they should be out?
[2014-06-26 10:57:35] brockfredin: jimevans Emotional give-up of the draw to Portgugal at the last minute.
[2014-06-26 10:58:04] brockfredin: jimevans So how can I get this to work?  I'm not seeing it.  Can you maybe point to the working directory that will work?  Give me a string?  :)

[2014-06-26 11:01:39] jimevans: the "shadow copying" bit is because nunit will often use a feature called "shadow copying", which means the paths get all screwed up.
[2014-06-26 11:02:35] dude-x: chrome not in focus issue is a bug; have to wait for chrome 36 :(

[2014-06-26 13:27:24] Ragnaroek: commented the part out. NOw it complains: Property getLogger of type goog.debug.Logger has been deprecated: use goog.log instead
[2014-06-26 13:27:39] Ragnaroek: maybe a lib update broke the safari build?
[2014-06-26 13:28:04] jimevans: the closure library has been updated. that may be the source of the confusion
[2014-06-26 13:28:30] jimevans: i know the safari driver is mostly unmaintained, as jleyba doesn't have time to maintain it any longer.
[2014-06-26 13:29:35] AutomatedTester: ooo that reminds me
[2014-06-26 13:29:41] AutomatedTester: I need to speak to an Apple chap
[2014-06-26 13:30:11] jimevans: if apple would get off their collective… resistance, and implement the w3c spec, we wouldn't have this problem
[2014-06-26 13:30:51] jimevans: (which is probably what AutomatedTester needs to speak to an Apple chap about)
[2014-06-26 13:31:44] Ragnaroek: can i force ./go to ignore deprecation warnings?
[2014-06-26 13:32:32] garndt: AutomatedTester just needs to get Tim Cook on the line real quick
[2014-06-26 13:33:22] AutomatedTester: no, I have been recommended someone who is on the Safari team that is interested in testing
[2014-06-26 13:33:40] jimevans: oh. well, never mind, then. :)
