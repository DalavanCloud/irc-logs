[2014-06-03 04:22:50] jimevans: this really doesn't have anything to do with selenium.
[2014-06-03 04:24:14] MattAtL: Hi.  Often on a test run I'll get a handful of test errors/fails that are false fails - down to a network issue or some weird timing thing or who knows what - next run they'll pass fine and a few others will fail.  I'm thinking of writing a wrapper (phpunit) to re-run the failing/erroring tests at the end of the run and see if we can get them to pass the second time round (and ignoring the initial failures if so).  Questio
[2014-06-03 04:24:16] MattAtL: n is: is this a bad idea in principle?
[2014-06-03 04:24:27] jimevans: Usr0011Bc: and without knowing what the page structure is, there's really no way to tell you how the script would be different. sorry.
[2014-06-03 04:24:53] jimevans: MattAtL: we do exactly that at my workplace.
[2014-06-03 04:25:14] MattAtL: jimevans that's very good to hear! Thank you
[2014-06-03 04:25:15] Usr0011Bc: I am so sorry!!
[2014-06-03 04:25:41] jimevans: we do flag tests that fail on the first run and pass on the second, so that the test author can know those tests are flaky

[2014-06-03 08:05:00] Jaro: It always happens after a driver.get timed out before it, after which it runs the test involving an iframe
[2014-06-03 08:05:18] Jaro: Which then causes all subsequent tests to fail
[2014-06-03 08:05:21] Jaro: because of the erorr
[2014-06-03 08:05:23] Jaro: error*
[2014-06-03 08:05:37] Jaro: (As in, drivers.get doesn't work, so no page changes happen)

[2014-06-03 14:26:58] nirvdrum: It's likely not remapped, but rather just wrapped.
[2014-06-03 14:27:22] nirvdrum: If you dig in and get the cause, you'll probably find the exception object you actually want.
[2014-06-03 14:28:00] detronizator: the fact is, why that doesn't happen for other browsers?
[2014-06-03 14:28:08] detronizator: at the end of the day I just send the right JSON back

[2014-06-03 14:28:47] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Well, I was assuming he had the client.  From the JSON, you're basically screwed.  Although in a lot of cases, it's still in the response body somewhere.
[2014-06-03 14:29:12] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: that bug report is awesome in detail
[2014-06-03 14:29:50] detronizator: AutomatedTester: u referring to the bug I linked or is this a cross-coversation?

[2014-06-03 14:30:53] detronizator: nirvdrum: wait - I can't possibly believe the code is so convoluted that a perfectly normal JSON response gets mapped in 2 very different ways between browsers
[2014-06-03 14:31:03] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I'm speaking specifically about the Java server implementation here.
[2014-06-03 14:31:12] AutomatedTester: ahh my bad
[2014-06-03 14:31:48] *detronizator is somehow more confused now...'
[2014-06-03 14:32:03] lukeis: detronizator: the java server is not a straight through proxy… it likes to deserialize all objects and then re-serialize them to send back to the client
[2014-06-03 14:32:17] detronizator: there must be a place X where phantomjs -> JSON with error -> selenium server -> wraps the error into a generic error -> sends it to client
[2014-06-03 14:32:34] lukeis: in the 'translation' it seems like it grabs the base exception class instead of the concrete instance
[2014-06-03 14:32:50] detronizator: lukeis: but if that is the case
[2014-06-03 14:32:56] detronizator: other implementations of the protocol
[2014-06-03 14:32:59] detronizator: should have the same issue
[2014-06-03 14:33:00] detronizator: no?
[2014-06-03 14:33:10] lukeis: have you checked? :)
[2014-06-03 14:34:03] detronizator: well, I haven't. I worked on the basic assumption: if this is broken for other browsers too, issues would be already raised
[2014-06-03 14:34:09] detronizator: anyway, I'll check right now

[2014-06-03 15:19:35] AutomatedTester: raminoid: get the viewport size
[2014-06-03 15:20:06] AutomatedTester: Since everything is clickable (might not fire anything) it will give you what you want
[2014-06-03 15:20:34] raminoid: AutomatedTester, I may have miss represented myself. I want to find all events that could be fired by a click so I can click on it
[2014-06-03 15:21:12] AutomatedTester: all elements that could fire events?
[2014-06-03 15:21:17] AutomatedTester: from a click?
[2014-06-03 15:21:26] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-03 15:22:29] raminoid: I want to write a generic tester that will find all buttons, for example and click on them. These could be HTML buttons, images or even a div that when clicked on will trigger an event
[2014-06-03 15:22:30] phasze: Click all the things!
[2014-06-03 15:23:21] raminoid: I am new to selenium so excuse me if I don't have my terminology straight.
[2014-06-03 15:23:28] phasze: raminoid: you could probably find all the buttons, but finding specific images and divs that are also clickable (and actually perform an action) is going to be problematic

[2014-06-03 15:25:01] phasze: you could always just "try" and click on everything lol
[2014-06-03 15:25:24] raminoid: phasze, I would like to think there is a better way :)

[2014-06-03 15:26:45] raminoid: Is there a way to find all the areas that when you hover over it changes to a click mouse icon
[2014-06-03 15:27:32] aljohri, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-03 15:28:54] phasze: raminoid: I believe that mouse/hand icon is browser specific
[2014-06-03 15:29:52] raminoid: phasze: unserstood, but can find all the regions that are (am I may be using the wrong word here) hovera-ble
[2014-06-03 15:30:05] raminoid: as it may be an indication that I can click this area
[2014-06-03 15:30:10] phasze: anything visible is "hovera-able"
[2014-06-03 15:31:02] phasze: and there are a few ways that browsers parse and interpret pages
[2014-06-03 15:31:17] phasze: for example, something with an href could be "clickable"
[2014-06-03 15:31:32] phasze: javascript can add click funcationility
[2014-06-03 15:31:48] phasze: buttons
[2014-06-03 15:31:49] phasze: etc
[2014-06-03 15:32:00] raminoid: is there a way to trigger all javascript click events, for example?

[2014-06-03 15:34:46] phasze: raminoid: your easiest solution would be to place some unique html attribute on every clickable thing beforehand
[2014-06-03 15:34:53] phasze: if you have access to source
[2014-06-03 15:35:40] raminoid: phasze, that I don't
[2014-06-03 15:39:00] phasze: tell your developers to :P
[2014-06-03 15:39:22] raminoid: phasze, that is not an option.
[2014-06-03 15:39:50] raminoid: My code will be tested using sites I don't know. So, I need this to be as generic as possible
[2014-06-03 15:40:04] raminoid: Is there a way to inject my own javascript into a page?
[2014-06-03 15:40:13] phasze: I'm afraid I'm not aware of another easy way besides clicking everything then
[2014-06-03 15:40:21] phasze: yes, you can execute javascript
[2014-06-03 15:41:23] raminoid: can you point me in the right direction. I think using jQuery I can find all click-able regions
[2014-06-03 15:41:38] raminoid: i.e. how can I inject my own javascript in the sire
[2014-06-03 15:41:39] raminoid: site
[2014-06-03 15:42:00] phasze: what language are you using?
[2014-06-03 15:42:15] raminoid: i'm using python, but can take examples in any language
[2014-06-03 15:43:07] phasze: driver.execute_script should do what you want
[2014-06-03 15:43:28] raminoid: the script can be local on my machine?
[2014-06-03 15:43:42] phasze: it can be in the selenium test
