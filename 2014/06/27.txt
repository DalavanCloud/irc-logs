[2014-06-27 11:20:13] LocusAsaf: can anyone explain why I get the following exception when I access an element? selenium.common.exceptions.StaleElementReferenceException during page refresh
[2014-06-27 11:22:24] jimevans: LocusAsaf: you found an element. then the page refreshed, which means the actual element you found is now gone (even though another element that can be found with the exact same criteria may exist on the refreshed page), but you tried to access it anyway. since the actual element you're attempting to access is gone, the reference to it is stale.
[2014-06-27 11:23:36] LocusAsaf: is there any method you can call on an element to handle that error besides wrapping it in a try catch?
[2014-06-27 11:25:21] jimevans: try-catch is the appropriate way to handle it. you, as the developer, should *know* when the page will refresh. thus, attempting to access an element to which you have a reference after it's gone is an exceptional state, which is why an exception is thrown.
[2014-06-27 11:27:00] jimevans: note: you may disagree with that philosophy; many do, but the fact remains that is the philosophy of the API, so you have to live with it or construct a framework that hides that philosophy.
[2014-06-27 11:27:12] dude-x: LocusAsaf: most people use wrappers around the core webdriver library
[2014-06-27 11:27:25] LocusAsaf: I am
[2014-06-27 11:28:04] LocusAsaf: return WebDriverWait(cls.driver, timeout).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, locator)))
[2014-06-27 11:28:30] jimevans: so the element is getting stale during the wait?
[2014-06-27 11:28:35] LocusAsaf: yes
[2014-06-27 11:28:50] jimevans: in that case, you can use FluentWait, and control what exceptions get ignored. :)
[2014-06-27 11:28:55] LocusAsaf: actually
[2014-06-27 11:29:05] LocusAsaf: the wait returns the object and then the page refreshes right afterwards
[2014-06-27 11:29:09] dude-x: you can do ignore=[StaleElementException]
[2014-06-27 11:29:17] dude-x: :apidocs

[2014-06-27 11:29:48] LocusAsaf: the thing I'm confused about is why it's returning the element in the first place
[2014-06-27 11:29:52] jimevans: or, you could also wait until stalenessOf(By.CSS_SELECTOR, locator)
[2014-06-27 11:30:11] dude-x: actually ignored_exceptions=[StaleElementExcpetion] in the construct for the wait
[2014-06-27 11:30:27] LocusAsaf: dude-x: awesome I'll take a look at using that
[2014-06-27 11:30:40] LocusAsaf: so like I was saying
[2014-06-27 11:30:48] LocusAsaf: the webdriver wait returns the element
[2014-06-27 11:31:01] LocusAsaf: and then the calling function gets the element back which is stale
[2014-06-27 11:31:30] LocusAsaf: what's confusing me is how it was able to return the element while the page was refreshing because during that time there is a lightbox and the element should not be clickable even though its on the page
[2014-06-27 11:31:50] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-27 11:31:58] LocusAsaf: does presence_of_element_located not check if its possible to interact with it?
