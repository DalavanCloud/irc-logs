[2014-06-21 13:42:47] lolwaitwut: tried using xpath, css path, id. nothing works. cant seem to find a way to click on it

[2014-06-21 13:47:26] AutomatedTester: lolwaitwut: //div[@role = "button"] will click on the first element that matches htat
[2014-06-21 13:48:00] AutomatedTester: so it could be somewhere else on the page
[2014-06-21 13:48:37] lolwaitwut: yea. I saw that. Is there any way to match it to the second or third item that matches it?
[2014-06-21 13:49:05] lolwaitwut: the second item is the button i actually want it to click
[2014-06-21 13:50:27] AutomatedTester: you could do find_elements(By.XPATH, '//div[@role = "button"]')[n].click()
[2014-06-21 13:50:38] AutomatedTester: but that could lead to flakey tests
[2014-06-21 13:51:29] lolwaitwut: mhmm, let me try
[2014-06-21 13:51:42] ato: Why not select by ID?
[2014-06-21 13:51:53] ato: There can only be one gc-quicksms-send2 in the document.
[2014-06-21 13:53:11] lolwaitwut: I tried that as well. it's unable to click on it
[2014-06-21 13:54:46] ato: Are you sure the event handler is connected to that element?  Even if it's a div element WD should click on it.
[2014-06-21 13:55:51] lolwaitwut: Yea, here's the screenshot of the html
[2014-06-21 13:55:52] lolwaitwut: http://puu.sh/9E9ZG/f622b1ebcb.png
[2014-06-21 13:58:48] lolwaitwut: Looks like when I use find_elements(By.XPATH, '//div[@role = "button"]')[0].click()
[2014-06-21 13:58:59] lolwaitwut: it clciks on the first button with the role="button"
[2014-06-21 13:59:09] lolwaitwut: like it did before. but when i change it to find_elements(By.XPATH, '//div[@role = "button"]')[1].click()
[2014-06-21 13:59:15] lolwaitwut: it fails to click on the second button =/
[2014-06-21 14:02:54] lolwaitwut: the form I'm submitting, i had to fill out with javascript using:
[2014-06-21 14:03:13] lolwaitwut: .execute_script("return document.getElementById('gc-quicksms-number').value = '2146363987';")
[2014-06-21 14:03:14] lolwaitwut: .execute_script("return document.getElementById('gc-quicksms-number').value = '2146363987';")
[2014-06-21 14:03:14] lolwaitwut: .execute_script("return document.getElementById('gc-quicksms-number').value = '2146363987';")
[2014-06-21 14:03:14] lolwaitwut: .execute_script("return document.getElementById('gc-quicksms-number').value = '11111111';")
[2014-06-21 14:03:31] lolwaitwut: is there any way i can use the same method to press the button?
