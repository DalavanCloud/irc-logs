[2014-06-02 07:48:35] jimevans: Recent history recap: I had a staph infection in my leg severe enough to cause hospitalization to receive IV antibiotics. After my release from the hospital, I was prescribed a follow-on course of oral antibiotics, to one of which I have a (previously-unknown) allergy. Now I am taking an antihistamine to counteract the symptoms of the allergic reaction, which of course, makes me incredibly drowsy.

Of course if there are any "frameworks" that do this that would be good too. We don't want to buy we are looking to build.

[2014-06-02 12:14:00] dimacus: hehehe, just curious if somoene wrote it and it's been left behind for decades or it actually reflects the current "best practices" on the idea of Page Objects
[2014-06-02 12:14:26] simonstewart: I wrote it
[2014-06-02 12:14:45] simonstewart: Approximately a billion years ago
[2014-06-02 12:15:08] simonstewart: And it’s what I still tell teams to do
[2014-06-02 12:15:12] dimacus: simonstewart: nice, are there any new bits of knowledge hard learned from experience that should be added to it?
[2014-06-02 12:15:31] simonstewart: I now build Page Objects on “Interactables"
[2014-06-02 12:15:46] dimacus: ok, do tell more
[2014-06-02 12:15:58] simonstewart: The genesis of which you can see in https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BotStyleTests
[2014-06-02 12:16:26] simonstewart: It arose from the need to expose the ability to interact with a modeled UI component

[2014-06-02 12:16:39] simonstewart: wihtout needing to become aware of the underlying WebDriver instance
[2014-06-02 12:16:59] simonstewart: So behind some Page Objects, I now have a set of interactions that the page permits
[2014-06-02 12:17:06] simonstewart: And these are exposed to users as needed
[2014-06-02 12:17:08] barancev, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-02 12:17:09] dimacus: i see, so the WD instance is just passed around in the class instanciation but never again
[2014-06-02 12:17:38] dimacus: i mean this makes a lot of sence ans that's how i typically think of the page object
[2014-06-02 12:17:43] simonstewart: If that. It’s possible to wire everything up using something like guiceberry
[2014-06-02 12:18:16] dimacus: true, so at that point the page object "factory" takes care of everything and the test does not even know the WD exists
[2014-06-02 12:18:41] simonstewart: Right
[2014-06-02 12:18:42] dimacus: it only knows that something has a interaction method, but it can be in WD, or Watir, or w/e else
[2014-06-02 12:19:06] simonstewart: Which means you can do something very cool: hold references to page objects you navigate to on fields (assuming they’re stateless)

[2014-06-02 12:20:27] dimacus: it abstracts everything to a point that you only have "page" variable that takes care of the
[2014-06-02 12:20:50] dimacus: actual interactions but it's not as tightly coupled to your DSL, it just wraps the WD instance

[2014-06-02 12:24:00] jarib: i think what simonstewart is talking about is intentionally coupled to the domain, otherwise it wouldn't be pretty pointless

[2014-06-02 12:24:19] simonstewart: jarib: yes. Exactly
[2014-06-02 12:24:37] jarib: you want to move away from describing UI interactions, and describe domain interactions
[2014-06-02 12:24:39] dimacus: i think that makes sense
[2014-06-02 12:25:05] dimacus: go for RegisteratPage.fillOutForm(formData) instead of
[2014-06-02 12:25:18] dimacus: RegistrationPage.type(foo, bar)
[2014-06-02 12:25:19] dimacus: right?
[2014-06-02 12:26:10] jarib: yeah, or go even further and not talk about "forms" at all
[2014-06-02 12:26:23] swypych, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-06-02 12:40:25] dimacus: simonstewart: one quick question, after reading the PageFactory wiki, https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageFactory why would i use a PageFactory over having a SearchPage inherit from BasePage which knows how to instanciate itself with a new driver instance?
[2014-06-02 12:40:36] dimacus: let me rephrase

[2014-06-02 12:40:57] dimacus: PageFactory vs Pages that inherit from a BasePage

[2014-06-02 12:42:19] dimacus: i see, this is where the 2 common ideas of Page Objects i've seen start to diverge
[2014-06-02 12:42:48] dimacus: 1) Page interaction that leads to a new page should return a new instance of that page as a return value for the method call
[2014-06-02 12:42:49] dimacus: vs
[2014-06-02 12:43:12] dimacus: 2) When a page change occurs, a new instance of the current page should be spun up by the page factory

However, later on I found that maximizeWindow also doesn't wait - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=7405. But it was declined. Why?
