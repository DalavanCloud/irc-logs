[2014-06-10 01:31:24] Jaro: I've been working on a reproducible piece of code, but nothin seems to do it
[2014-06-10 01:31:29] Jaro: nothing*
[2014-06-10 01:32:20] Jaro: The gist of it is, I use driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.tagName("iframe"))) to switch to an iframe, log in there with sendKeys etc... and as it logs me in, the iframe closes automatically, at which point I try to search for elements again, but that seems to fail
[2014-06-10 01:32:37] Jaro: sometimes
[2014-06-10 01:33:00] Jaro: in an undetermined pattern
[2014-06-10 01:35:00] Jaro: I think it somehow remains inside that non-existing iframe.
[2014-06-10 01:35:09] Jaro: Am I missing a function to jump out of it, or something?

[2014-06-10 02:01:14] michael_lee: so I guess this was caused by firefox 29.0

[2014-06-10 07:33:02] ingshtrom: PDL: do do a WebDriverWait().Until() and inside the Until, wait for a OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException or StaleElementReferenceException is thrown.
[2014-06-10 07:33:18] ingshtrom: If you get the NoSuchElementException, then a search couldn't find the element.
[2014-06-10 07:33:45] ingshtrom: If you get the StaleElementReferenceException, then you had a reference to an element that is no longer there, or the DOM has updated.
[2014-06-10 07:34:47] ingshtrom: If I were you, I would continually wait for the NoSuchElementException and keep calling FindElement every iteration because StaleElementReferenceExceptions don't necessarily mean the element is removed from the DOM. It could also have just changed properties, or location in the DOM.

[2014-06-10 07:35:59] ingshtrom: Usually when I see that it is because I didn't clean up a firefox instance correctly

[2014-06-10 13:22:48] kyoob: where do you make the call?  do you poll the driver object as soon as you get to the page object?
[2014-06-10 13:23:26] kyoob: at what point does the test know it's running in safari so it'll need method S vs. method F?
[2014-06-10 13:24:03] kyoob: sorry, it's kind of a vague best practices question
[2014-06-10 13:24:29] kyoob: do you just write a whole other test suite for safari?
