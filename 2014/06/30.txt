[2014-06-30 05:41:00] simonstewart: I’m grumpy today, so, you know, fair warning
[2014-06-30 05:41:17] barancev: :)
[2014-06-30 05:41:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Ave?
[2014-06-30 05:41:57] WhereIsMySpoon: what is 'Ave'
[2014-06-30 05:42:12] simonstewart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ave
[2014-06-30 05:42:31] barancev: salutation to the Caesar
[2014-06-30 05:42:52] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, ave
[2014-06-30 05:42:58] WhereIsMySpoon: I thought this was some weird english word
[2014-06-30 05:43:00] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 811
[2014-06-30 05:43:03] simonstewart: Latin :)
[2014-06-30 05:43:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i know that one ^^
[2014-06-30 05:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: ya
[2014-06-30 05:43:20] simonstewart: There was one memorable day when this channel broke out into Latin
[2014-06-30 05:43:28] simonstewart: Very odd, but lots of fun
[2014-06-30 05:43:46] WhereIsMySpoon: salwe
[2014-06-30 05:44:06] simonstewart: Excellent
[2014-06-30 05:44:13] WhereIsMySpoon: puella est in Canor
[2014-06-30 05:44:15] WhereIsMySpoon: salwe puella
[2014-06-30 05:44:28] WhereIsMySpoon: (I hope someone gets that reference)
[2014-06-30 05:44:53] barancev: salve, iirc, not salwe
[2014-06-30 05:44:55] simonstewart: Ecce, Romani!
[2014-06-30 05:45:19] WhereIsMySpoon: blah
[2014-06-30 05:45:43] WhereIsMySpoon: I know quite a lot of religious latin
[2014-06-30 05:45:53] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know what it means
[2014-06-30 05:45:56] WhereIsMySpoon: but I can recite it
[2014-06-30 05:45:57] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-06-30 05:46:27] simonstewart: Ha!
[2014-06-30 05:46:39] simonstewart: Ecce Romani -> “Look! The Romans!"
[2014-06-30 05:47:20] WhereIsMySpoon: I prefer italian
[2014-06-30 05:47:21] barancev: "w" is a rare letter in classic Latin, it was more typical for barbaric names and titles
[2014-06-30 05:47:34] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: yea true
[2014-06-30 05:47:46] WhereIsMySpoon: singing in latin is annoying

[2014-06-30 06:13:09] Zoddie: Hello again guys, I think I am going to switch from java to javascript. Does anyone here write for selenium in javascript? If so, how do you get your work flow fluid. Do you use something like Webstorm?
[2014-06-30 06:13:59] barancev: journey to the dark side? why? :)
[2014-06-30 06:14:52] *WhereIsMySpoon quite likes the dyanmic typing that js brings'
[2014-06-30 06:15:09] barancev: groovy?
[2014-06-30 06:15:16] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-06-30 06:15:17] Zoddie: I have to write automations for work using javascript, so I might as well learn it
[2014-06-30 06:15:22] Zoddie: groovy is used here too
[2014-06-30 06:15:41] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: we only use java here
[2014-06-30 06:15:54] Zoddie: but yeah, i figure if i have to learn javascript for work, then i might as well use javascript for selenium
[2014-06-30 06:15:59] barancev: groovy, jython, jruby, scala -- they are all "java", in essense
[2014-06-30 06:16:15] barancev: jvm-based langs
[2014-06-30 06:16:25] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: yah but nobody else knows those here so I cant effectively write code with them
[2014-06-30 06:16:38] WhereIsMySpoon: if I could write jruby i would be quite happy
[2014-06-30 06:16:41] WhereIsMySpoon: i like ruby
[2014-06-30 06:17:45] Zoddie: plus i'm also studying node js and socket io and other things
[2014-06-30 06:18:22] *WhereIsMySpoon has heard a lot of bad things about node'
[2014-06-30 06:18:41] Zoddie: i've used it a lot ... it's fine
[2014-06-30 06:19:00] Zoddie: look @ this http://threejs.org/
[2014-06-30 06:19:10] Zoddie: all of those incredibly detailed and high quality graphics games
[2014-06-30 06:19:17] Zoddie: instantly loaded and playable via browser
[2014-06-30 06:19:21] WhereIsMySpoon: eww
[2014-06-30 06:19:23] Zoddie: node js is an amazing thing
[2014-06-30 06:19:27] WhereIsMySpoon: dislike
[2014-06-30 06:19:32] Zoddie: what do you dislike
[2014-06-30 06:19:33] WhereIsMySpoon: the website
[2014-06-30 06:19:43] Zoddie: oh the way they display the three.js games?
[2014-06-30 06:19:45] WhereIsMySpoon:  dont like the layout
[2014-06-30 06:19:50] barancev: webdriver js bingings use promices very active, if you like this style - you're lucky, otherwise...
[2014-06-30 06:19:53] Zoddie: they should have just used a word list
[2014-06-30 06:19:55] Zoddie: instead of pictures
[2014-06-30 06:19:57] Zoddie: i agree
[2014-06-30 06:20:06] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: what?
[2014-06-30 06:20:09] Zoddie: but that's not the point WhereIsMySpoon
[2014-06-30 06:20:10] WhereIsMySpoon: can you try that in english?
[2014-06-30 06:20:12] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-06-30 06:20:14] WhereIsMySpoon: Zoddie: yah I know
[2014-06-30 06:20:15] barancev: what is promices?
[2014-06-30 06:20:20] Zoddie: i would much prefer it if the website had the ftp directory layout
[2014-06-30 06:20:29] WhereIsMySpoon: "bindings use promises very active"?
[2014-06-30 06:20:33] Zoddie: it's the games on it... high quality, graphics, instantly playable
[2014-06-30 06:20:36] Zoddie: it's a future tech
[2014-06-30 06:20:52] barancev: https://www.promisejs.org/
[2014-06-30 06:21:14] WhereIsMySpoon: the sentence still doesnt make sense
[2014-06-30 06:21:18] barancev: callback-based programming style
[2014-06-30 06:21:31] WhereIsMySpoon: callbacks are so 5 years ago
[2014-06-30 06:21:38] barancev: webdriver js bindings are callback-based
[2014-06-30 06:21:40] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-06-30 06:22:11] barancev: async callback-based api

[2014-06-30 06:23:45] *chp hoping you guys are python guys'
[2014-06-30 06:24:02] *WhereIsMySpoon has looked at python before'
[2014-06-30 06:24:10] *WhereIsMySpoon has even written some code in it 2 years ago'
[2014-06-30 06:24:21] chp: lol well maybe this will be a general question and im just being an idiot
[2014-06-30 06:24:26] WhereIsMySpoon: fire ahead

[2014-06-30 06:26:09] chp: i got a cold sore the last time i went in there
[2014-06-30 06:26:12] chp: its like going into #cisco
[2014-06-30 06:26:16] WhereIsMySpoon: try #ruby instead
[2014-06-30 06:26:20] WhereIsMySpoon: theyre lovely there
[2014-06-30 06:26:22] chp: ...
[2014-06-30 06:26:25] WhereIsMySpoon: also ruby is very similar to python
[2014-06-30 06:26:30] chp: if your name is Chris
[2014-06-30 06:26:33] chp: ill shit my pants
[2014-06-30 06:26:35] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-06-30 06:26:36] WhereIsMySpoon: nope
[2014-06-30 06:26:44] chp: i have an old work buddy
[2014-06-30 06:26:46] chp: that loved ruby
[2014-06-30 06:26:50] WhereIsMySpoon: i like ruby
[2014-06-30 06:26:52] chp: and we used to fight abt python vs ruby
[2014-06-30 06:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: many people like ruby
[2014-06-30 06:26:57] WhereIsMySpoon: naw
[2014-06-30 06:27:01] WhereIsMySpoon: theyre similar
[2014-06-30 06:27:01] chp: so you suggesting to go to ruby
[2014-06-30 06:27:10] chp: reminded me of him, small world ya never know
[2014-06-30 06:27:11] WhereIsMySpoon: #ruby is full of helpful people who dont curse at you
[2014-06-30 06:27:14] chp: maybe ill look into it
[2014-06-30 06:27:16] chp: hah
[2014-06-30 06:27:17] WhereIsMySpoon: i know i know, radical

[2014-06-30 06:27:33] chp: as a fellow curser
[2014-06-30 06:27:37] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-06-30 06:29:08] WhereIsMySpoon: chp: out of curiosity, why did you come to #selenium to ask this
[2014-06-30 06:29:11] WhereIsMySpoon: seems rather...odd
[2014-06-30 06:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: been here much before?
[2014-06-30 06:29:39] chp: i partied in here a few months ago when i was writing a script using selenium + phantomjs
[2014-06-30 06:29:46] chp: got help
[2014-06-30 06:29:49] chp: helped some
[2014-06-30 06:29:52] chp: then left

[2014-06-30 06:57:19] chpp: not selenium related
[2014-06-30 06:57:20] chpp: this question
[2014-06-30 06:57:49] chpp: im telnetting to a cisco device using telnetlib and it's just flakey. i read_until("username") then write('admin')
[2014-06-30 06:57:53] chpp: but it never writes the username
[2014-06-30 06:58:09] chpp: i read_until(password) underneath and while it never shows password on the read_all
[2014-06-30 06:58:12] chpp: it still writes the pw
[2014-06-30 06:58:40] chpp: so im just trying to understand why telnetlib is either 1. super buggy or 2. why its reading until username then writing the pw
[2014-06-30 06:59:18] chpp: im abt to try switching to ruby lol
[2014-06-30 06:59:42] chpp: want to see the script?
[2014-06-30 07:00:53] dude-x: telnet lib is very tempermental
[2014-06-30 07:01:22] dude-x: there are heavier alternatives like twisted; or you can use something like pexpect
[2014-06-30 07:01:59] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-30 07:02:08] chpp: so its probably safe to blame telnetlib

[2014-06-30 07:12:23] dude-x: use netcat

[2014-06-30 09:09:39] jimevans: (around for a long time, that is)
[2014-06-30 09:09:56] jimevans: but not as a spec at the w3c level.
[2014-06-30 09:10:04] WhereIsMySpoon: I see
[2014-06-30 09:11:08] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: and my other q? :)
[2014-06-30 09:11:10] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: it would be next to impossible for that to happen. the copyright for all of the code is assigned to a non-profit (501(3)(c)) corporation
[2014-06-30 09:11:24] jimevans: who would they "pay" for it?
[2014-06-30 09:11:28] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-06-30 09:11:32] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont have a clue how that works
[2014-06-30 09:12:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno, maybe one or more of you guys get offers to work on the drivers for more money for a specific company

[2014-06-30 09:15:59] jimevans: we get some donations, but not always in cash. google has been particularly generous with hosting, ci infrastructure, and employee time and effort. saucelabs has been very generous too
[2014-06-30 09:16:29] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: google gets some employees to help work on chrome webdriver i guess?
[2014-06-30 09:16:31] jimevans: but no, there's not a hugely funded, ton-of-cash-on-hand foundation that employs people specifically to work on Selenium.
[2014-06-30 09:17:08] jimevans: inasmuch as they have employees working on chromium (the open-source project on which chrome is based), yes.
[2014-06-30 09:17:17] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I see...seems like a pity as this stuff is very useful to a lot of people ^^
[2014-06-30 09:17:29] WhereIsMySpoon: bet you could do a lot more with some proper funding
[2014-06-30 09:17:36] jimevans: from your lips to $deity's ears.

[2014-06-30 09:18:46] *WhereIsMySpoon looks up what saucelabs is'
[2014-06-30 09:18:47] jimevans: but the whole point of the w3c spec effort is to eliminate a lot of the currently volunteer browser-specific work.
[2014-06-30 09:19:14] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: and put the burden back on the companies that make the browsers?
[2014-06-30 09:19:18] jimevans: because if the browser manufacturer can provide the driver, the language bindings are pretty lightweight.
[2014-06-30 09:19:24] WhereIsMySpoon: yah
[2014-06-30 09:19:38] WhereIsMySpoon: I bet a lot of time is spent either asking the companies questions or trying to reverse engineer stuff
[2014-06-30 09:20:04] WhereIsMySpoon: or waiting on them for bugfixes
[2014-06-30 09:20:16] WhereIsMySpoon: like for ie11 atm :)
[2014-06-30 09:20:25] jimevans: and that's happening. the chromium project provides chromedriver; mozilla has marionette, its driver for firefox, under active development; microsoft has pushed a first-version alpha of its IE driver.

[2014-06-30 11:36:14] lukeis: flash has a javascript api, the flash object should be coded to accept certain function calls to it
[2014-06-30 11:36:38] dogarrhea: lukeis: it doesn't change the fact that the content could show an elephant raping a hippo
