[2014-06-04 05:07:02] santhosh: Is it good practise to convert IDE script to Java file in selenium and use those scripts for automation
[2014-06-04 05:07:24] MattAtL: santhosh: yes, I think so
[2014-06-04 05:07:50] MattAtL: I think IDE generated scripts are seen as rather fragile and not as clear as hand-written ones
[2014-06-04 05:08:08] MattAtL: Selectors for locating DOM elements especially
[2014-06-04 05:08:16] santhosh: yep..
[2014-06-04 05:08:26] MattAtL: plus source control
[2014-06-04 05:08:30] santhosh: but thing is it is reducing some time
[2014-06-04 05:09:20] MattAtL: There's a bit more work to do, the IDE ones execute directly in the browser, whereas others have to get there via java/selenium hub
[2014-06-04 05:09:42] MattAtL: But is it much different, compared to the time it takes for the tests themselves to run?
[2014-06-04 05:10:32] santhosh: Not much difference...

[2014-06-04 10:03:10] jimevans: assume you wanted to create a new driver in java. knowing that you have to implement the WebDriver interface, doesn't it make sense that you'd reference at least the client .jar in your class path?
[2014-06-04 10:05:28] jimevans: no, because clearly the right answer is to create your own interface that sort of (but doesn't quite) have methods with similar names to the selenium project's WebDriver methods, and implement *that*. and furthermore, have zero reference to the actual WebDriver interfaces anywhere.
[2014-06-04 10:05:52] jleyba: ?

[2014-06-04 10:33:51] detronizator: that said, the documentation of the WireProtocol is very much missing that important detail and I wonder if this behaviour shouldn't be changed
[2014-06-04 10:34:07] detronizator: yesterday night I haven't got any strong "opinion" and later I might give it a go at rewriting that bit
[2014-06-04 10:34:09] bitgeeky, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-04 10:35:09] detronizator: I have in mind to map the "status" (that is an integer code) to the exception class - the "class" field will be left to the Remote Driver to report which class failed (or maybe we can ditch it)
[2014-06-04 10:37:14] jleyba: why do you have to pass the class back? (you dont)
[2014-06-04 10:39:05] detronizator: u do, otherwise Selenium server defaults to WebDriverException

[2014-06-04 10:41:34] detronizator: nope
[2014-06-04 10:41:39] detronizator: check the code please
[2014-06-04 10:41:40] jleyba: then that is a big fat bug in the java code
[2014-06-04 10:41:46] detronizator: yep, it is
[2014-06-04 10:41:51] detronizator: I have reproduced it clearly yesterday
[2014-06-04 10:42:01] detronizator: the test to reproduce is in the issue above
[2014-06-04 10:42:10] detronizator: and I have managed to run the Selenium Server in debug mode to prove it
[2014-06-04 10:42:37] detronizator: it's all down to this method: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c40285e5242f796b15b4
[2014-06-04 10:42:50] Usr0011Bc, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-06-04 10:42:52] detronizator: essentially it takes the "class" field AS IS
[2014-06-04 10:42:58] detronizator: and does a Class.forName()
[2014-06-04 10:43:17] detronizator: so you got to pass a fully qualified Java Class name
[2014-06-04 10:43:27] detronizator: to have Selenium Server re-serialize your exception right
[2014-06-04 10:43:45] detronizator: of course, if you use your driver directly, none of that code is used and all is good in the Shire
[2014-06-04 10:44:05] detronizator: I also have to "suppose" Grid doesn't behave like Server, otherwise more people would know about this "funny business"
[2014-06-04 10:44:18] jleyba: no....this doesn't seem right... I think you might be misreading something
[2014-06-04 10:44:52] detronizator: well, I have tested and managed to make this code "play ball" with GhostDriver
[2014-06-04 10:45:09] detronizator: by just passing "class" : "org.....NoSuchElementException"
[2014-06-04 10:46:45] jleyba: The bug report is pretty clear
[2014-06-04 10:46:56] jleyba: you're returning the wrong status code when an element cannot be found
[2014-06-04 10:47:05] jleyba: {"status":13,"sessionId":"937ab686-2ddf-452f-b782-
[2014-06-04 10:47:08] detronizator: nope - please read it again
[2014-06-04 10:47:11] jleyba: that should be {"status":7
[2014-06-04 10:47:26] detronizator: the bug shows that if using the driver DIRECTLY the status is correct and the exception as well
[2014-06-04 10:47:48] detronizator: but when using a Selenium Server the exception get defaulted to WebDriverException (that is mapped to generic 13)
[2014-06-04 10:48:10] detronizator: i.e. without Selenium Server in the middle, there is no bug

[2014-06-04 13:26:17] ato: jash4: I think the problem is that strongly typed languages typically need different signatures for returning a single and a sequence of elements.
[2014-06-04 13:26:38] jash4: ato, guess you're right! :)
[2014-06-04 13:26:46] ato: Whereas in a dynamically typed language you can go els[0] or els.first and be done with it.
