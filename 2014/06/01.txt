[2014-06-01 12:39:44] WLP|Away: I derived from NavigationWrapper, but my class needs extra parameters that the base class doesn't take.
[2014-06-01 12:40:16] WLP|Away: So the constructor that AbstractWrapper.WrapOriginal is looking for won't exist.

[2014-06-01 12:47:49] barancev: WLP|Away: show your code (and a use case)
[2014-06-01 12:48:55] WLP|Away: Here's one class. http://pastebin.com/A4h5Q1MJ
[2014-06-01 12:49:34] WLP|Away: And the rest >> http://pastebin.com/8njw6Shj
[2014-06-01 12:51:18] WLP|Away: The goal is to log all messages on each page surrounded by a specific CSS class.
[2014-06-01 12:51:18] barancev: btw, I've created new EventFiringWrapper, it is pushed to the repo, but not deployed to maven central yet
[2014-06-01 12:51:36] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-01 12:51:52] WLP|Away: barancev: Is the related to the bug I filed?

[2014-06-01 12:53:11] WLP|Away: No recent posts on it. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=7385&can=4&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary
[2014-06-01 12:53:26] barancev: no idea, I have not looked yet, sorry
[2014-06-01 12:55:33] WLP|Away: With WebDriverWrapper, it makes more sense for the derived class (for me, RemoteEvtFiringWebDriver) to allocate the instance of NavigationWrapper.
[2014-06-01 12:55:50] WLP|Away: Rather than simply listing the class.
[2014-06-01 12:56:05] WLP|Away: Time for laundry.  Be back shortly.
[2014-06-01 12:56:29] barancev: I think your use of wrappers does not fit my intention :)
[2014-06-01 12:57:24] barancev: they are designed to delegate, not extend
[2014-06-01 13:00:37] barancev: I suppose you want to log something after methods of Navigate
[2014-06-01 13:01:39] barancev: so you'd better use the new EventFiringWrapper and implement a listener that extends AbstractWebDriverListener and overrides several methods
[2014-06-01 13:03:05] barancev: EventFiringWrapper wrapper = new EventFiringWrapper(driver); wrapper.addListener(...); driver = wrapper.getDriver();
[2014-06-01 13:04:47] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-06-01 13:07:24] WLP|Away: barancev: And that's when the bug I mentioned happened.  So unless you think your recent changes fix that...
[2014-06-01 13:09:45] barancev: EventFiringWrapper != EventFiringWebDriver
[2014-06-01 13:11:11] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-01 13:12:11] WLP|Away: Oh.  Didn't realize you were talking about a new class.  Where's the Javadoc for it?
[2014-06-01 13:13:02] barancev: no javadoc yet :)
[2014-06-01 13:13:10] barancev: EventFiringWrapper wrapper = new EventFiringWrapper(driver); wrapper.addListener(...); driver = wrapper.getDriver();
[2014-06-01 13:14:01] WLP|Away: It uses the same listerner class as the old Selenium EventFiringWebDriver?
[2014-06-01 13:14:09] barancev: a listener extends AbstractWebDriverListener and overrides some methods
[2014-06-01 13:14:13] WLP|Away: And where do I download it?
[2014-06-01 13:14:27] barancev: it is much more precise than the default implementation
[2014-06-01 13:14:35] barancev: https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-extensions/tree/master/webdriver-wrapper/src/main/java/ru/stqa/selenium/wrapper
[2014-06-01 13:14:46] barancev: the code can be downloaded here
[2014-06-01 13:15:21] barancev: I'm going to deploy it to maven tomorrow... or the day after tomorrow
[2014-06-01 13:15:32] WLP|Away: Oh.  So you updated your extensions jar?
[2014-06-01 13:15:39] WLP|Away: Now I think I understand.
[2014-06-01 13:17:35] barancev: the jar is not updated yet. the source repository is
[2014-06-01 13:18:26] WLP|Away: I meant it's going to be part of the same library.

[2014-06-01 13:46:49] barancev: yes, I have a plan to suggest including this wrapper implementation to the main source tree as it is mature enough and well-documented
[2014-06-01 13:47:12] WillPittenger: "Well documented" being relative.
[2014-06-01 13:47:27] WillPittenger: Selenium documentation is lousy-especially in the server stuff.
[2014-06-01 13:48:45] barancev: wrappers are designed to be used to extend the driver functionality, so it must be well-documented

[2014-06-01 15:03:43] regedit: a pesky popup throws selenium off and boom i'm outa business
[2014-06-01 15:06:45] WillPittenger: regedit: As in window.alert?
[2014-06-01 15:07:33] WillPittenger: regedit: barancev just recently pointed me to code he's been working on: https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-extensions/blob/master/webdriver-wrapper/src/test/java/ru/stqa/selenium/wrapper/UnhandledAlertHandlingWrapperTest.java#L13

[2014-06-01 15:08:25] WillPittenger: Don't know then.
[2014-06-01 15:08:41] regedit: in addition, i'm using FireFox and i disabled popups entirely...

[2014-06-01 15:33:17] aaronds: Hi. I've just started developing with selenium on OSX. I've had everything run great on windows but for some reason I get a NoSuchFieldError when initialising the web driver on osx. Using 2.42.1. I've submitted a post to the google group but it hasn't been approved as of yet. Stacktrace: http://pastebin.com/AfiwLYLu
[2014-06-01 15:33:27] aaronds: Does anyone know what I'm missing?

[2014-06-01 17:13:32] mircer: Hi I had a question about using selenium in an Android App created in Eclipse....
[2014-06-01 17:14:46] WillPittenger: mircer: I remember there was a library specific to Android.  I figure there aren't any WebDrivers for Selenium itself.
[2014-06-01 17:16:04] mircer: hmmm....
[2014-06-01 17:16:49] mircer: i can run a standalone selenium project in eclipse if i create it as a java project...
[2014-06-01 17:17:42] mircer: but if i try to import the selenium jar files into eclipse and run the same code (i.e create a webdriver and open a webpage) in an android hello world app....i get errors when i run it
[2014-06-01 17:18:25] mircer: i tried it with selenium and also with htmlunit but get the exact same type of errors...
[2014-06-01 17:19:04] nirvdrum: mircer: Check out Selendroid.
[2014-06-01 17:22:31] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 824
[2014-06-01 17:23:23] WillPittenger: mircer: Sounds like Selenium is calling code that doesn't exist in Dalvik.  I suggest you do what nirvdrum suggested.

[2014-06-01 17:33:00] mircer: i loaded the selendroid server on the phone....and then if i use just a selendroid client compiled as a java project it works.....but if i include the client calls in an android app and then compile i get errors
[2014-06-01 17:33:42] mircer: i was thinking it had something to do with the files within in the selenium jar file and maybe they were conflicing wiht the files in the android.jar or something like that

[2014-06-01 17:36:49] mircer: i'm trying to have my android app do some basic web scraping....thought using the selenium libraries would be the easiest way to go....
[2014-06-01 17:37:26] mircer: i chose it cause u can also execute the javascript on pages....hence the reason i didn't go with jsoup
