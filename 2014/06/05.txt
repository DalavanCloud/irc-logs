[2014-06-05 05:18:47] MattAtL: but then it looked like Selenium internals
[2014-06-05 05:19:02] MattAtL: so are you still getting that error when it can't find the element that you can see?
[2014-06-05 05:19:12] cgoldberg: is anyone using subunit (python) for streaming test results?
[2014-06-05 05:19:49] user1: MattAtL,  when it cant find the loaded element. it just says, "cant find it" and that makes the browser stuck and opened up for ever
[2014-06-05 05:20:07] user1: as driver.quit() is at the next line. the next line is never reached
[2014-06-05 05:20:46] MattAtL: well it looks like it's something to do with Selenium communicating, but I'm afraid that's beyond me...
[2014-06-05 05:25:37] user1: MattAtL,  is this fine code ? http://pastie.org/9260898

[2014-06-05 07:47:49] jimevans: and i'm quite sure the python and ruby maintainers feel the same way.

[2014-06-05 08:31:55] jimevans: but the standalone server isn't the only server in the world that understands that protocol
[2014-06-05 08:32:16] jimevans: chromedriver.exe does too, and so does phantomjs.
[2014-06-05 08:32:37] crocket: However, webdriver.io fails to communicate with phantomjs directly.
[2014-06-05 08:32:59] crocket: webdriver.io is said to implement JSON protocol well.
[2014-06-05 08:33:02] jimevans: so if the language binding knows how to launch the executable (which the webdriver javascript bindings do), it can launch that, and use it directly to talk to those server implementations using the same wire protocol.

[2014-06-05 08:36:23] jimevans: i don't say that to be a jerk, i just don't use javascript language bindings of any flavor, and i have other tasks that i'm actually getting *paid* to do, so i really can't take the necessary time to see how robust the wire protocol implementation is of a third-party language binding in a language i don't even use in my day-to-day work right now. :)
[2014-06-05 08:38:29] crocket: It seems python is better for my needs.

[2014-06-05 08:39:13] jimevans: no, it means i work on webdriver on a volunteer basis.

[2014-06-05 09:01:01] ato: crocket: Yep.
[2014-06-05 09:01:06] crocket: cgoldberg, I'm not very rich, but I'm more or less a free citizne of ancient greece.
[2014-06-05 09:01:14] ato: lukeis: Very unbritish!
[2014-06-05 09:01:50] crocket: Nowadays, there are wage slaves and capitalists.

[2014-06-05 09:02:53] lukeis: ato: the funny thing to me is that we have a much larger presence in dublin
[2014-06-05 09:03:09] ato: Oh many IT companies do.
[2014-06-05 09:03:20] ato: The company tax there is very low IIRC.
[2014-06-05 09:03:22] ato: So are the wages.
[2014-06-05 09:03:25] lukeis: yep
[2014-06-05 09:03:32] jimevans: MSFT used to have a *huge* operation in dublin.
[2014-06-05 09:03:38] jimevans: i assume they still do
[2014-06-05 09:03:39] lukeis: all of our front-line ops are in dublin
[2014-06-05 09:03:46] crocket: hmm....
[2014-06-05 09:03:47] ato: Yeah.  A friend of mine worked for IBM over there.  Worst job he's had.
[2014-06-05 09:04:05] crocket: What is the best selenium webdriver library regardless of its officiality?
[2014-06-05 09:04:13] lukeis: also the 'central' sales office for europe is in dublin ;)
[2014-06-05 09:04:27] lukeis: crocket: for what language?
[2014-06-05 09:04:37] jimevans: crocket: that's a very, very subjective question, as well as being language-dependent
[2014-06-05 09:04:37] crocket: For any decent langauge except java?
[2014-06-05 09:04:48] lukeis: i'm partial to java and python :)
[2014-06-05 09:05:17] lukeis: you should choose the language that your developers also know
[2014-06-05 09:05:28] crocket: If I don't care about cross-browser testing, I can just stick to zombiejs or ghost.py
[2014-06-05 09:05:55] crocket: lukeis, I currently use casperjs.
[2014-06-05 09:05:57] lukeis: i highly recommend not using *only* selenium for testing :)
[2014-06-05 09:06:11] crocket: Everyone knows js.
[2014-06-05 09:06:16] lukeis: unit test, functional test, integration tests… all different ;)

[2014-06-05 09:06:34] lukeis: (there's more in there… but those are the main ones in my mind)
[2014-06-05 09:06:58] crocket: lukeis, My company doesn't do automated test.
[2014-06-05 09:07:05] crocket: lukeis, It does tests manually.
[2014-06-05 09:07:10] lukeis: phantomjs + ghostdriver works for me… and I run it locally with python selenium ;)
[2014-06-05 09:07:25] crocket: lukeis, Why not ghost.py?
[2014-06-05 09:07:27] lukeis: but my work here is all Java
[2014-06-05 09:07:40] lukeis: cause i happen to like the selenium api ;)
[2014-06-05 09:07:45] jimevans: crocket: would you care to share where you're employed? i want to make sure i never ever attempt to work there.
[2014-06-05 09:08:00] crocket: jimevans, It's in south korea, and you'll never know about it.
[2014-06-05 09:08:00] lukeis: :)
[2014-06-05 09:08:13] crocket: jimevans, It's about to become irrelevant.
[2014-06-05 09:08:28] jimevans: fair enough.
[2014-06-05 09:08:41] crocket: My company doesn't do automated tests because workers weren't given enough time to automate tests.
[2014-06-05 09:08:59] crocket: The CEO doesn't see how it affects the bottom line with 6-7 QA workers hired to do manual tests.
[2014-06-05 09:09:17] crocket: If all tests were automated, the company didn't need any QA.
[2014-06-05 09:09:47] crocket: Maybe 1 QA worker at most.
[2014-06-05 09:10:21] garndt: Most of our company develops in Java, but I fight hard to not convert my stuff :)  I'm stubborn
[2014-06-05 09:10:30] crocket: garndt, your stuff?
[2014-06-05 09:11:01] garndt: crocket: the automation that I'm working on
[2014-06-05 09:11:13] crocket: Writing tests in java is nuts.
[2014-06-05 09:11:22] crocket: unless codebase is in java.
[2014-06-05 09:11:25] garndt: and the product line I'm on, I'm the only one working on it.  we have selenium elsewhere in the company but it's ranges between java and .NET

[2014-06-05 09:14:13] crocket: That doesn't sound reasonable.
[2014-06-05 09:14:43] jimevans: sorry. 40 hours.
[2014-06-05 09:14:50] jimevans: slipped finger.
[2014-06-05 09:15:13] crocket: Modern theories suggest that we don't need to work 40 hours.
[2014-06-05 09:15:38] jimevans: well, that includes "non-productive" time too, like meetings and the like.

[2014-06-05 09:17:42] crocket: If you work more, extra workhorus are filled with bullshits or executive pet projects.

Doesn't always work out that way, but it does help that we have a no-meeting day. And well, turning on and off that "developer productive" switch is often hard :)

[2014-06-05 14:00:42] lukeis: it's to maintain the Selenium test infrastructure at salesforce (for desktop and mobile)

[2014-06-05 14:06:50] lukeis: the test harness i suppose, coordinating efforts with other teams to get the hardware needed or integrate with third party tools

[2014-06-05 14:09:37] detronizator: this morning was on a rush
[2014-06-05 14:10:03] detronizator: so, it sounds like you are saying we should ditch the current behaviour for just mapping the "status" to the right "XException"
[2014-06-05 14:10:16] AutomatedTester: that sounds more sane
[2014-06-05 14:10:30] detronizator: my patch does that, but before doing that tries to still use the "old" behaviour
[2014-06-05 14:10:43] detronizator: AutomatedTester: if you get a sec to look at the patch
[2014-06-05 14:10:51] detronizator: would love your comments too
[2014-06-05 14:11:04] detronizator: my initial work was just changing the behaviour to the "sane" one
[2014-06-05 14:11:08] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I haven't looked because jleyba commented and he knows what he is doing :)
[2014-06-05 14:11:13] AutomatedTester: sometimes...
[2014-06-05 14:11:33] detronizator: it took quite the arguing to make him see my reasons, right jleyba?
[2014-06-05 14:11:35] detronizator: :)
[2014-06-05 14:12:23] AutomatedTester: detronizator: he took over from Simon at Google so he needs to be a little curmudgeon
[2014-06-05 14:12:25] detronizator: plus, I must say, it feels like this "discovery" was unexpected: before assuming "it's just wrong" I want to make sure I'm not just ignoring some obscure reasoning
[2014-06-05 14:12:53] detronizator: AutomatedTester: LOL - no he doesn't! :)
[2014-06-05 14:13:14] detronizator: unless what you are saying that Googlers need to be like that "by design"
[2014-06-05 14:13:30] AutomatedTester: not Googlers

[2014-06-05 14:14:57] p_l|backup: been in interviews for Google SET, in the end I'm happy I didn't get in
[2014-06-05 14:15:00] detronizator: so that I can sleep at night
[2014-06-05 14:15:13] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I dont know the code in that area but your patch looks good to me
[2014-06-05 14:15:24] p_l|backup: doing testing all time is not my kind of fun in the end :)
[2014-06-05 14:15:29] detronizator: I'll wait for jleyba to give a final confirm
[2014-06-05 14:15:35] detronizator: thanks AutomatedTester ;)
[2014-06-05 14:15:55] AutomatedTester: it loaded it in Atom... I need to delete that
[2014-06-05 14:16:02] detronizator: p_l|backup: I think they mostly yell at you "SVN > Mercurial > Git" - that's what the job requires
[2014-06-05 14:16:33] AutomatedTester: detronizator: well they are a little right
[2014-06-05 14:16:38] AutomatedTester:  Mercurial > Git
[2014-06-05 14:16:44] AutomatedTester: on large code bases
[2014-06-05 14:16:56] detronizator: I'm not going there

[2014-06-05 14:19:35] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: it might be due to how they use git...
[2014-06-05 14:20:07] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: no not really, they have been able to optimize mercurial where they cant with git
[2014-06-05 14:20:17] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: and mercurial has extension points
[2014-06-05 14:20:26] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: the facebook repo is ~54GB

[2014-06-05 14:20:39] *detronizator is going to play Watch Dogs now and ignore AutomatedTester - if jleyba comes around and gives a final confirm I'm good to go'
[2014-06-05 14:20:57] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: I hope they at least consider forest extensions
[2014-06-05 14:21:17] *p_l|backup likes both hg and git, even though git is his personal choice'
[2014-06-05 14:21:19] AutomatedTester: p_l|backup: yea, once you get to a certain since, trunk based single repo is best
[2014-06-05 14:21:31] AutomatedTester: s/since/size
[2014-06-05 14:22:11] p_l|backup: AutomatedTester: or a better management of multiple repos and their interdependencies ... which is why I mentioned hg forest extensions (iirc, Sun played around with them)

[2014-06-05 14:51:15] newblord: im using selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2.jar
[2014-06-05 14:51:33] newblord: i have the hub setup on a virtual box on my pc
[2014-06-05 14:51:48] newblord: and im trying to register a node from my pc to that virtual box
[2014-06-05 14:52:10] newblord: it says registering to http://<ip>
[2014-06-05 14:52:12] lukeis: how?
[2014-06-05 14:52:16] newblord: but i get no confirmation
[2014-06-05 14:52:34] newblord: the virtualbox is part of my local network

[2014-06-05 14:53:04] lukeis: how are you trying to connect the selenium node to the selenium grid?

[2014-06-05 14:53:53] newblord: do i need to open up my port 5566 on my firewall?
[2014-06-05 14:54:03] lukeis: yes :)
[2014-06-05 14:54:04] newblord: i opened 4444, 5555 on the hub
[2014-06-05 14:54:13] lukeis: on the node 5566 should be open
[2014-06-05 14:54:28] lukeis: (since that's the port you're telling it to run on)

[2014-06-05 15:36:36] phasze: newblord: what version was he using?
[2014-06-05 15:36:37] newblord: so do i need to keep both the cmd open in order for selenium grid to work?
[2014-06-05 15:36:43] newblord: 2.13
[2014-06-05 15:36:57] phasze: heh, yeah it may have changed since then
[2014-06-05 15:37:17] phasze: you need the hub and at least one node open for it to work yes
[2014-06-05 15:37:34] phasze: with the proper browsers registered for your program of course
[2014-06-05 15:37:34] newblord: man i was going crazy for like past 4 hrs
[2014-06-05 15:37:49] phasze: if you can see it in the grid console you're usually OK
[2014-06-05 15:37:57] newblord: when i registered the node it registered 5 chrome versions and 5 firefox versions and 1 ie
[2014-06-05 15:38:18] phasze: that's the default
[2014-06-05 15:38:36] newblord: is there a way to start the selenium server instead of using a cmd prompt?
[2014-06-05 15:38:53] newblord: i dont want the qa ppl to close the cmd and start bitching
[2014-06-05 15:39:25] lukeis: you have to leave the command prompt open...
[2014-06-05 15:39:46] lukeis: running it as a service is Not Supported™
[2014-06-05 15:40:14] phasze: *hopes one day it is*
[2014-06-05 15:40:28] newblord: i have it running using a task scheduler
[2014-06-05 15:40:40] lukeis: phasze: that one day will be when IE takes over it completely and they support it...
[2014-06-05 15:40:50] lukeis: so when you only need to support IE11+  ;)
[2014-06-05 15:40:53] newblord: ahah doubt that will happen
[2014-06-05 15:40:54] phasze: *concedes it will never happen*
[2014-06-05 15:40:59] phasze: lol
[2014-06-05 15:41:13] lukeis: well, MS has written a driver for IE11
[2014-06-05 15:41:21] newblord: so how do i pass the scripts to the hub to test than?
[2014-06-05 15:41:22] phasze: IE11 is supported by MS?
[2014-06-05 15:41:26] phasze: oh gand
[2014-06-05 15:41:28] phasze: dang*
[2014-06-05 15:41:38] lukeis: but they have no intention of supporting anything earlier than 11
[2014-06-05 15:41:47] phasze: at least you got them to do something
[2014-06-05 15:41:47] newblord: or do i just run the scripts from hte node box

[2014-06-05 15:54:01] zerg: how did you guys solve the "non-unique users running in parallel" test problem?
[2014-06-05 15:54:33] zerg: i have a user, User.  I log in with this user simultaneously with other tests now that we are parallel.
[2014-06-05 15:54:39] zerg: how do I manage a user pool?
[2014-06-05 15:55:05] zerg: so each test logs in with a unique user, therefore not writing junk into a databse
[2014-06-05 15:55:40] zerg: This is something that would prevent grid/sauce or even hub tests from running correctly
[2014-06-05 15:57:37] zerg: guess the salesforce people never really solved it
[2014-06-05 15:57:38] zerg: https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/ForumsMain?id=906F000000090LEIAY
[2014-06-05 16:00:53] zerg: a lot of apps use the database to track sessions
[2014-06-05 16:01:11] zerg: so, there's no real way to do this or people don't know or it's a limitation is what i'm hearing from all the activity in here
[2014-06-05 16:02:20] zerg: I can think of schemes where I hard code numbers in each test to uniquely identify which user a test should log in with and running some database script to create those users
[2014-06-05 16:02:29] zerg: but that's retarded maintenance wise.
[2014-06-05 16:03:03] zerg: We could also call some api service and attempt to incrementally log in every time the service says that a user is already logged in
[2014-06-05 16:03:06] zerg: but this also is stupid
[2014-06-05 16:04:29] aljohri: anyone here part of the python developers from selenium webdriver? or part of the android webdriver?

[2014-06-05 16:06:48] aljohri: had a question about potential collab for python bindings on the chrome side specifically. wondering if any of you have come across the "Remote Debugging Protocol 1.1" for Chrome or Android Webviews? https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/protocol/1.1/index
[2014-06-05 16:07:12] AutomatedTester: aljohri: ChromeDriver should handle those
[2014-06-05 16:07:19] aljohri: I needed to connect to an existing webview on android kitkat (which is why I couldn't use the android webdriver) so I wrote a library that wraps around this API
[2014-06-05 16:07:25] aljohri: oh shit
[2014-06-05 16:07:31] aljohri: haha, let me check it out

[2014-06-05 16:09:50] AutomatedTester: how are you starting the app to get the webview?

[2014-06-05 16:10:24] AutomatedTester: heard of Selendroid?
[2014-06-05 16:10:52] aljohri: ya but it requires an app on the android side and the webview runs within the app if i'm not mistaken

[2014-06-05 16:13:59] AutomatedTester: must have been a great learning experience :)
[2014-06-05 16:18:09] aljohri: yeah it seems like ChromeDriver can do exactly what I want although I'm not sure how "ChromeDriver supports running tests on Chrome browser (version 30+) as well as WebView-based apps starting in Android 4.4 (KitKat) that have enabled web debugging and JavaScript."
[2014-06-05 16:18:38] AutomatedTester: thats a question for my learned colleagues at Google
[2014-06-05 16:19:37] p_l|backup: aljohri: there's a bridge available to control apropriately-enabled WebView or Chrome from "desktop" Chrome
[2014-06-05 16:20:06] aljohri: p_l|backup: yeah, are you talking about using chrome://inspect ? I needed a way to do it programmatically
[2014-06-05 16:21:40] aljohri: AutomatedTester: do you know any of the ChromeDriver guys? are they on IRC per chance? Just want to know the full extent of what the project can do and if the whole API is implemented. hopefully I can just contribute to an existing one instead of reinventing the wheel

[2014-06-05 16:29:55] zzebelzz: AutomatedTester: thanks
[2014-06-05 16:34:39] aljohri: p_l|backup: yeah, it seems like that's how it works - I'm not sure if the webdriver wire protocol maps to all features of the remote debugging protocol. found the source for it and it seems pretty comprehensive https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/test/chromedriver/README.txt
[2014-06-05 16:35:02] aljohri: I really wish googlesource had a nicer interface haha
[2014-06-05 16:35:54] p_l|backup: aljohri: I simply suspect that the actual protocol is the same for both desktop and mobile chrome, and chromedriver just knows how to tunnel it to mobile

[2014-06-05 16:40:30] aljohri: maybe, one key difference I see is that the JsonWireProtocol is all synchronous json requests while the remote debugging protocol uses websockets and has these "notifications", for example when the DOM changes it gives you a notifications
[2014-06-05 16:42:42] p_l|backup: aljohri: I suspect the remote one might be used to dynamically drive in-browser devtools
[2014-06-05 16:45:24] aljohri: p_l|backup: yeah, that makes sense. some little features like highlighting sections of the screen which I use extensively don't seem to be available in the json wire protocol
[2014-06-05 16:47:45] p_l|backup: JSON Wire Protocol is more about logical operations that you drive programmatically, the remoting protocol appears to me like fast event bridge supplying what devtools normally get with direct calls and callbacks
