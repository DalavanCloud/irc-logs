[2014-06-12 03:02:26] bl4ckscor3: oh
[2014-06-12 03:02:33] bl4ckscor3: alright let me rephrase it
[2014-06-12 03:02:35] ato: bl4ckscor3: Are you trying to get the results from the input in the field after pressing the button?
[2014-06-12 03:02:40] bl4ckscor3: yes
[2014-06-12 03:02:44] ato: bl4ckscor3: Do you have an example link I can try out?
[2014-06-12 03:03:01] bl4ckscor3: http://adf.ly/o9Q0p
[2014-06-12 03:03:23] barancev|2: bl4ckscor3: use findElements to get the list
[2014-06-12 03:04:04] ato: bl4ckscor3: els = findElements(By.cssSelector("#results a")) should do the trick
[2014-06-12 03:04:34] ato: Then getAttribute("href") or something on each of those els.
[2014-06-12 03:05:15] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-12 03:06:53] bl4ckscor3: so #results searches for an element with result as an id, and a gets all the elements defined within the given id?
[2014-06-12 03:09:16] ato: The CSS expression "#results a" finds all a elements inside #results.  findElementS (note plural ending) returns list of web elements.

[2014-06-12 03:32:38] bl4ckscor3: ato, im using java
[2014-06-12 03:32:51] bl4ckscor3: should have added that
[2014-06-12 03:32:53] ato: edoloughlin: IIRC you can't interact with the chrome in ChromeDriver.
[2014-06-12 03:33:32] ato: edoloughlin: Pressing the tab character might send you to the UI element, but that might put WebDriver into a non-recoverable state.
[2014-06-12 03:34:01] ato: edoloughlin: I don't know which JS binding you're using, so it's quite hard for me to say which file the Tab constant key is defined in.
[2014-06-12 03:34:09] ato: bl4ckscor3: Should be fairly easy to translate into Java.
[2014-06-12 03:34:14] edoloughlin: ato: I need to give permission to access the camera/mic. Is it possible to do this using Selenium?
[2014-06-12 03:34:25] edoloughlin: I can use Java - the docs seem better :)
[2014-06-12 03:34:39] ato: That was for the other guy (-:
[2014-06-12 03:35:03] ato: edoloughlin: I'm not sure really.  It might be possible to instrument Chrome by setting a pref or sending a command-line flag.
[2014-06-12 03:35:06] edoloughlin: I'm in the middle of switching anyway - the JS docs are just too raw
[2014-06-12 03:35:23] ato: In Java it's found in org.openqa.selenium.Keys IIRC.
[2014-06-12 03:35:30] edoloughlin: The command line flags don't seem to work at the moment....
[2014-06-12 03:35:33] ato: So sendKeys(Keys.TAB)
[2014-06-12 03:35:46] ato: Then that's a bug in Chromium.
[2014-06-12 03:36:04] edoloughlin: I'll bash away  - thanks. If I serve my tests over HTTPS then I can give permission manually once (I hope)

[2014-06-12 03:37:11] ato: Right.
[2014-06-12 03:37:21] ato: I wouldn't be surprised if there was a way to instrument this in Chrome FWIW.
[2014-06-12 03:38:02] bl4ckscor3: ato, what does lambda mean?
[2014-06-12 03:38:38] ato: bl4ckscor3: A lambda is equivalent to an anonymous function in Java.
[2014-06-12 03:38:45] bl4ckscor3: ah
[2014-06-12 03:39:03] ato: I could've written the whole thing as a regular function and passed it in as a function reference instead.
[2014-06-12 03:39:40] ato: So in Java it would be .until(new ExpectedCondition() { public apply(…) } something or another.
[2014-06-12 03:42:33] bl4ckscor3: ato, what do i need to let the method apply return?
[2014-06-12 03:42:43] bl4ckscor3: or is that not really neede?
[2014-06-12 03:42:48] bl4ckscor3: neede*
[2014-06-12 03:42:54] bl4ckscor3: needed
[2014-06-12 03:42:56] bl4ckscor3: there we go
[2014-06-12 03:43:50] bl4ckscor3: and what is the map(...) method equivalent to in java?
[2014-06-12 03:45:33] ato: A functional map is only built into Java 8 onwards I think.
[2014-06-12 03:45:38] bl4ckscor3: oh right
[2014-06-12 03:45:42] bl4ckscor3: i remember
[2014-06-12 03:45:46] ato: The easiest is to do a for-loop over the elements.
[2014-06-12 03:46:22] ato: So for (WebElement el : els) { links.add(el.getAttribute("href")); }.
[2014-06-12 03:46:33] ato: My Java is a bit rusty.
[2014-06-12 03:47:05] bl4ckscor3: and links is a string array?
[2014-06-12 03:47:52] ato: Yeah, or whatever data structure you prefer.  But getAttribute returns strings in this case.

[2014-06-12 11:29:48] ato: I'm guessing he means from a Function or ExpectedCondition.
[2014-06-12 11:29:53] sevaseva, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-12 11:30:17] ato: bl4ckscor3: You return type T you specify in the method's signature.
[2014-06-12 11:30:26] bl4ckscor3: jimevans, yes
[2014-06-12 11:30:46] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: what ato said.
[2014-06-12 11:31:26] jimevans: returning null causes the wait to continue waiting; returning non-null of type T causes the wait condition to be met.
[2014-06-12 11:32:04] bl4ckscor3: so i do return driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("#results a"));?
[2014-06-12 11:32:10] ato: bl4ckscor3: So in this case I guess something like until(new ExpectedCondition<WebElement> { public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) { return driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("#results a")); } }).
[2014-06-12 11:32:16] bl4ckscor3: ok
[2014-06-12 11:33:11] jimevans: yeah, but for something like that, i'd probably use one of the existing ExpectedConditions, if one already exists.
[2014-06-12 11:33:22] *jimevans isn't an expert on the java implementation.'
[2014-06-12 11:33:36] ato: There's probably a shorthand in ExpectedConditions.java, indeed.
[2014-06-12 11:33:41] ato: I'm not very familiar with them though.
[2014-06-12 11:34:12] *ato has found his use cases for explicit waits is always special cased'
[2014-06-12 11:34:30] jimevans: yep. how about ExpectedConditions.presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy()
[2014-06-12 11:35:21] ato: bl4ckscor3: So using what jimevans suggested you could do .until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy(By.cssSelector("#results a"))) or something.
[2014-06-12 11:35:57] ato: This is for reference: https://gist.github.com/andreastt/b11e042d459750130ac6
[2014-06-12 11:35:58] jimevans: precisely
[2014-06-12 11:37:44] bl4ckscor3: 	elementList = new WebDriverWait(driver, 5L).until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy(By.cssSelector("#results a"))); is throwing a TimeoutException
[2014-06-12 11:38:40] jimevans: then for whatever reason, it's not finding any elements meeting that criteria within 5 seconds.
[2014-06-12 11:39:02] bl4ckscor3: ill try to give it more time
[2014-06-12 11:39:21] jimevans: but without seeing a sample page and being able to debug it, i'd not be able to say more.

[2014-06-12 11:43:31] ato: Does it actually load the expected results?

[2014-06-12 11:45:13] ato: When you run the program, does it do all the steps you expect it to?  Is it hitting the button?  Are the results appearing, why does it time out?
[2014-06-12 11:45:39] zzebelzz: bl4ckscor3:: thats a valid css selector i presume ?
[2014-06-12 11:45:48] bl4ckscor3: zzebelzz, ato gave it to me

[2014-06-12 11:47:00] bl4ckscor3: ato, im not using a browser at all - im doing that for an irc bot, which puts the url parsed as an argument by the user into the box, clicks the button, and should reply with the result

[2014-06-12 12:00:33] bl4ckscor3: would it be needed for the vps the bot is hosted on to have the browser installed?
[2014-06-12 12:00:55] ato: bl4ckscor3: But if you're writing this as a backend service for an IRC bot, chances are you might be interested in finding out if that site has a proper API.  Or possibly just do these requests via something like libcurl or Apache HttpClient.
[2014-06-12 12:01:01] jimevans: bl4ckscor3: yes, but my suggestion would be to try it locally first, on a machine with the browser installed.
[2014-06-12 12:01:17] jimevans: ato: +1
[2014-06-12 12:01:22] bl4ckscor3: ato, i already asked the owner of the site, they currently dont have an api
