[2014-06-24 04:44:18] HolyGoat: Is there any clean way to check if any 404s were encountered when loading a page using Selenium server? (am using the Python bindings)
[2014-06-24 04:45:13] ato: HolyGoat: WebDriver automates the browser from a user's perspective, and the user doesn't “see” 404 HTTP status codes.
[2014-06-24 04:45:31] ato: HolyGoat: So the only option is that you check for some trademark in the document that signifies that it's a 404 page.
[2014-06-24 04:45:50] ato: HolyGoat: E.g. if the page contains a h1 with the text "404 Not Found", you could check for that.
[2014-06-24 04:46:52] HolyGoat: ato: Hm ok, thanks. No way to see if any resources on the page (like images) threw a 404 either?
[2014-06-24 04:47:16] ato: Not unless you put a proxy in between WebDriver and the server.
[2014-06-24 04:47:52] HolyGoat: That's a shame.. thanks
[2014-06-24 04:48:14] HolyGoat: I think maybe I shouldn't be abusing Selenium to implement some means of web application monitoring
[2014-06-24 04:48:42] ato: There are a lot things Selenium isn't suited to do.
[2014-06-24 04:48:57] HolyGoat: I'm becoming aware of that :)
[2014-06-24 04:49:21] HolyGoat: I based this on it. https://github.com/objectified/selmon
[2014-06-24 04:49:44] ato: You have to remember that it's a framework that emulates user interaction to the browser; not one which instruments the browser internals to retrieve technical information from the browser debugger.
[2014-06-24 04:49:45] HolyGoat: But I'm heavily beginning to doubt that this is a good idea
[2014-06-24 04:50:06] HolyGoat: A very important viewpoint indeed.
[2014-06-24 04:50:20] HolyGoat: Maybe Phantom is more suitable for what I need
[2014-06-24 04:50:31] ato: So I don't know this tool, but it's a good tool if what you want to check is that the _website_ loads fine and that it behaves as it should be in that context.
[2014-06-24 04:51:37] HolyGoat: Well I wrote it, no one knows it ;) But yeah, it only works for very basic checks
[2014-06-24 04:52:13] ato: If your site has resources loaded dynamically they will only be fetched using a real browser, and the only way you can check that they were indeed loaded is by putting a proxy in between the thing that loads the websites into your browser, and your remote server.
[2014-06-24 04:52:50] ato: For the simpler case maybe a curl call is enough.
[2014-06-24 04:52:55] HolyGoat: ato: Or something that has a more tight coupling to a browser engine (like PhantomJS with V8), right?
[2014-06-24 04:53:11] ato: Possibly.  I don't know PhantomJS well enough.
[2014-06-24 04:53:21] ato: But I know it's not a real browser.
[2014-06-24 04:53:55] HolyGoat: Yes I've done this stuff many times with cURL, but I was looking at a more "real" way of monitoring. And especially in the case of ever more complicated javascript frameworks, it's hard to do any "headless" monitoring anymore (meaning, monitoring without a browser engine)
[2014-06-24 04:54:10] HolyGoat: Not a real browser indeed
[2014-06-24 04:54:24] ato: Right, that's exactly the problem.
[2014-06-24 04:55:09] barancev|2: phantomjs is much more real than curl, at least
[2014-06-24 04:55:44] HolyGoat: I was trying to implement monitoring for a GWT application the other day, that's when I was forced to stop using cURL (serialized Java objects passed around etc.. yuk)
[2014-06-24 04:56:04] ato: Solution is to replace Java, obviously (-:
[2014-06-24 04:56:24] HolyGoat: Completely different department, fortunately :)
[2014-06-24 04:56:38] barancev|2: to replace google, not java
[2014-06-24 04:56:44] HolyGoat: heh
[2014-06-24 04:56:57] ato: It would be cool if the browsers had standardized developer tools protocols.
[2014-06-24 04:57:22] HolyGoat: Yes, or something like monitoring hooks
[2014-06-24 04:57:23] ato: That would allow us to load a page in WebDriver, hook into Firefox' devtools to check if a resource was loaded.
[2014-06-24 04:57:34] ato: Right, you could build something like that on top of that.
[2014-06-24 04:57:38] HolyGoat: That would be heaven

[2014-06-24 04:57:54] ato: I suggested this in… 2009.  Google and Mozilla didn't agree it was a good idea.
[2014-06-24 04:58:04] HolyGoat: Bah
[2014-06-24 04:58:19] HolyGoat: We should break up with them
[2014-06-24 04:58:22] ato: At the time I worked on Scope, which did this for Presto-Opera.
[2014-06-24 04:58:39] ato: Anyways, it'll come eventually.
[2014-06-24 04:58:45] HolyGoat: It will?
[2014-06-24 04:58:55] ato: I can't see how not.
[2014-06-24 04:58:56] barancev|2: on the other hand, both java-based web toolkits I dealt with (google, oracle) are ugly

[2014-06-24 07:39:52] workthrick: hi, in the JS driver, how can I get the locator used when I get a NoSuchElementError? Most of the time, I get only "NoSuchElementError: no such element", which is useless, and including the full stacktrace by default makes it awfully spammy
[2014-06-24 07:40:09] workthrick: for reference, I'm running it via protractor + jasmine

[2014-06-24 07:43:40] workthrick: oddly enough, I do get a specific error messages for *some* locators: "Error: No element found using locator: By.cssSelector("select")" and "Error: No element found using locator: by.repeater(size in pagingOptions.pageSizes").row("1")""
[2014-06-24 07:44:15] workthrick: not By.id though

[2014-06-24 07:47:02] workthrick: ato: oh, maybe I phrased it poorly. In this specific case, the cssSelector is perfectly adequately reported. I'd like the same kind of informative message when a findElement(By.id(...)) fails, instead of the rather useless "NoSuchElementError: no such element"
[2014-06-24 07:47:37] workthrick: I don't quite get why it doesn't show the selector always
[2014-06-24 07:47:40] ato: My answer is still the same (-:
[2014-06-24 07:47:40] workthrick: *locator
[2014-06-24 07:47:49] ato: You store your locator in a separate variable before you catch the exception.
[2014-06-24 07:47:55] workthrick: ato: what does that acomplish?
[2014-06-24 07:48:18] ato: Preserving the locator you passed in.

[2014-06-24 07:51:16] workthrick: also, it might be related to the fact those are locators from protractor.* namespace

[2014-06-24 10:10:57] ato: nirvdrum: You can infer from that.
[2014-06-24 10:11:21] Guest33220: why does selenium also select hidden elements?
[2014-06-24 10:11:23] nirvdrum: ato: Heh. Well, I really like the look of the language.  But I'm an ML fan.
[2014-06-24 10:11:53] ato: ML the language?
[2014-06-24 10:12:33] ato: Besides the type declarations from ML, what similarities are there?
[2014-06-24 10:13:00] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 834
[2014-06-24 10:13:27] nirvdrum: The let syntax is ML.  Variable scoping is the same I believe.  And all the pattern matching stuff.
[2014-06-24 10:14:04] ato: Ah right, I don't know ML.
[2014-06-24 10:14:19] nirvdrum: Using OCaml would probably be the natural answer.  But it has a really poor multi-process model.  GIL and all that.
[2014-06-24 10:14:20] ato: But it's not functional per se.
[2014-06-24 10:14:33] ato: It's more like C++ in that regard because of its class system.
[2014-06-24 10:14:45] nirvdrum: I'm not a pure functional nut.
[2014-06-24 10:15:01] nirvdrum: I do like immutable variables by default and things like that.
[2014-06-24 10:15:05] nirvdrum: And I love pattern matching.
[2014-06-24 10:15:31] ato: So pattern matching is pretty interesting.
[2014-06-24 10:15:40] nirvdrum: It's amazing.
[2014-06-24 10:15:47] ato: But I think I'm more a purist in that I think it has too many features already.
[2014-06-24 10:16:18] ato: Like, it keeps accumulating all of these in and by themselves novel ideas from all sorts of various languages.
[2014-06-24 10:16:24] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2014-06-24 10:16:30] nirvdrum: They've removed some.
[2014-06-24 10:16:35] ato: I guess it'll remain to be seen if they can be successfully be combined to make a good language
[2014-06-24 10:16:36] ato: .
[2014-06-24 10:16:45] nirvdrum: Yeah.  It's an interesting project.
[2014-06-24 10:16:47] ato: (It should be noted I don't really know it very well, but that's my immediate impression.)
[2014-06-24 10:16:58] nirvdrum: I'm far from an expert.
[2014-06-24 10:17:29] ato: I think they have got a lot of things right.
[2014-06-24 10:17:35] nirvdrum: But I used to like doing low-level stuff.  Having that much control over memory could be nice, especially if it's all safe by default.  Picking up an ML-variant along the way is icing on the cake.
[2014-06-24 10:18:06] nirvdrum: I've flirted with go, but it just isn't my thing.  Cloning master from git repos and calling it a dependency is kinda lame.
[2014-06-24 10:18:24] ato: The interfacing with C is pretty important, I think.  And that they support shared libraries.
[2014-06-24 10:18:32] nirvdrum: Scala & F# are the other two big ML-variants.  Both have hefty VMs.
[2014-06-24 10:18:56] ato: Right, I'm pretty into Go at the moment.  I like its simplicity.
[2014-06-24 10:18:58] nirvdrum: Fine for long-lived processes.  Sucky for short-lived tools.
[2014-06-24 10:19:11] ato: Yup.
[2014-06-24 10:19:31] ato: We should have a language discussion next time we meet.  I love languages.
[2014-06-24 10:19:33] nirvdrum: I can appreciate its simplicity.  But it feels too constraining.  And call me crazy, but I like inheritance.
[2014-06-24 10:20:02] nirvdrum: The implicit interface thing is pretty nice at face value.  But I can see it utterly falling apart, too.
[2014-06-24 10:20:08] ato: I agree about the constraints (-:
[2014-06-24 10:20:10] nirvdrum: And it's been abused to support generics.
[2014-06-24 10:20:36] nirvdrum: But the biggest complaint I have by far is no one seems to tag their libraries.  It's just expected you use whatever master happens to be.
[2014-06-24 10:20:36] ato: But I must leave you on that cliff as it were.
[2014-06-24 10:20:41] ato: I need to get some food.
[2014-06-24 10:20:43] nirvdrum: Not exactly the best way to build a stable platform.
[2014-06-24 10:20:45] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2014-06-24 10:20:51] nirvdrum: Over scotch sometime :-)
[2014-06-24 10:20:58] ato: Yeah, I agree with what you say here.

[2014-06-24 11:56:28] CSWookie: Hi all.  I'm using webdriver with python bindings.  I'm resizing using driver.set_window_size() before taking a screenshot, and the screenshot is cutting up an element that is fixed to be the height of the screen on the right side of the window.
[2014-06-24 11:57:05] CSWookie: The webdev suggested that maybe selenium was resizing window or viewport without resizing the other, and was confusing things.

[2014-06-24 13:41:14] nirvdrum: maven, for all its faults, gets the dependency part right for the most part these days.  Dependencies can be downloaded in parallel.  They can be marked as "provided".  They can be overridden if something wants X.Y.2 and you know X.Y.4 is compatible.  And there's a rich mirror system where once published, an artifact remains published.

[2014-06-24 13:44:27] AutomatedTester: I like that maven does that part really well but once the dependecies are down I would like a npm layout on disk (so I can commit the downloaded modules if I want) with the ease of recreating virtual environments like virtualenv in python
[2014-06-24 13:45:57] nirvdrum: I'm not super familiar with virtualenv (it came after my Python hayday).  But I think it was based on RVM and I can't stand RVM gemsets.

[2014-06-24 14:02:05] nirvdrum: What's doubly weird is it only removes it from the index.  And bundler uses the index.
