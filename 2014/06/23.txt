[2014-06-23 02:31:45] AutomatedTester: morning simonstewart
[2014-06-23 02:31:58] simonstewart: I actually have time set aside this week for spec work
[2014-06-23 02:32:02] simonstewart: The mind boggles
[2014-06-23 02:32:06] AutomatedTester: wow...
[2014-06-23 02:32:15] simonstewart: And I’ve been hacking on the selenium build to package up the tests into a single executable unit
[2014-06-23 02:32:20] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I nearly fainted there
[2014-06-23 02:32:21] simonstewart: For MS to have a play with
[2014-06-23 02:32:26] simonstewart: Yeah, yeah, yeah
[2014-06-23 02:32:41] AutomatedTester: we also need an agenda for the f2f
[2014-06-23 02:32:44] simonstewart: I just described my week to the new guy on the team here. He looked suitably scared
[2014-06-23 02:32:56] simonstewart: 1) Review current spec
[2014-06-23 02:33:05] simonstewart: 2) Figure out what’s missing and if it’s needed
[2014-06-23 02:33:18] simonstewart: 3) Plans for mobile?
[2014-06-23 02:33:22] simonstewart: 4) Spec work
[2014-06-23 02:33:46] AutomatedTester: we have discussed mobile before and we decided that its been punted
[2014-06-23 02:33:56] simonstewart: Then we have three items :)
[2014-06-23 02:33:58] AutomatedTester: mobile specific items
[2014-06-23 02:34:03] simonstewart: Anything that needs to be brought up?
[2014-06-23 02:34:09] AutomatedTester: bugs
[2014-06-23 02:34:36] AutomatedTester: the main one that has people grumbling is getProperty needs to be added and getAttribute MUST stop conflating things
[2014-06-23 02:35:27] simonstewart: FFS
[2014-06-23 02:35:48] simonstewart: That old chestnut
[2014-06-23 02:35:58] AutomatedTester: yup
[2014-06-23 02:36:09] AutomatedTester: and its not just from 1 side
[2014-06-23 02:36:10] simonstewart: Who are “people"?
[2014-06-23 02:36:19] AutomatedTester: Mozillians and Googlers
[2014-06-23 02:37:09] simonstewart: Then we’ll replay the Great Debate of Our Time one more time
[2014-06-23 02:37:23] AutomatedTester: there is a bug for it
[2014-06-23 02:38:45] simonstewart: THis is planned to be the last f2f before we ship, right?
[2014-06-23 02:40:57] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-23 02:41:00] AutomatedTester: I think so
[2014-06-23 02:41:06] AutomatedTester: we can do phone calls after that
[2014-06-23 02:41:40] AutomatedTester: one person described getAttribute returning properties as "Oh great, webdriver trying to be fucking helpful but being the exact opposite"
[2014-06-23 02:42:26] simonstewart: One person hasn’t had to deal with QA before
[2014-06-23 02:42:47] wilhelm: I've added a placeholder agenda page here: https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebDriver/2014-July-F2F
[2014-06-23 02:42:49] simonstewart: Replied on the list
[2014-06-23 02:42:50] wilhelm: Feel free to add stuff.
[2014-06-23 02:42:57] AutomatedTester: this person has a lot of experience with QA

[2014-06-23 02:43:28] simonstewart: I’ll copy the agenda in

[2014-06-23 02:43:40] neeti, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-06-23 02:43:49] AutomatedTester: browser QA, W3C QA
[2014-06-23 02:44:18] neeti, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-23 02:44:41] simonstewart: So not “QA with an offshoring team” QA
[2014-06-23 02:45:00] AutomatedTester: no, but thats just 1 person
[2014-06-23 02:45:37] AutomatedTester: as I said, there are more than 1 person who wants this change and some don't work on the browser
[2014-06-23 02:45:51] simonstewart: Then we’ll have the debate again
[2014-06-23 02:45:56] simonstewart: One. Last. Time
[2014-06-23 02:46:32] wilhelm: How about ... HTTP response headers? :D

[2014-06-23 02:48:10] simonstewart: COME HERE AND SAY THAT!
[2014-06-23 02:48:35] wilhelm: I can add it to the agenda...
[2014-06-23 02:48:37] simonstewart: BTW, if this helps, according to a survey I just took, I’m ENTP: http://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality
[2014-06-23 02:49:16] wilhelm: Weak or strong P? (c:
[2014-06-23 02:49:40] simonstewart: “Turbulant”
[2014-06-23 02:50:15] simonstewart: Strong P
[2014-06-23 02:50:28] wilhelm: Interesting.
[2014-06-23 02:50:43] simonstewart: Yeah. Thought you might find that handy

[2014-06-23 04:15:17] Mr-F: I've found that if I change it to driver.find_element_by_xpath("//a[contains(text(),'Existing Users Log-In')]").click() that it works a treat

[2014-06-23 07:21:05] simonstewart: Greetings!
[2014-06-23 07:21:24] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: have you organised that we don't need to sign NDAs for the F2F?
[2014-06-23 07:21:41] simonstewart: I’ll ask again.
[2014-06-23 07:21:58] jimevans: so in response to your email, should we add specific bugs to the agenda, if we want to make sure they're discussed and give people time to review? or should we just bring a list.
[2014-06-23 07:22:10] simonstewart: yes, add specific bugs
[2014-06-23 07:22:17] jimevans: copy that.
[2014-06-23 07:22:24] simonstewart: That way we can get going as fast as we can
[2014-06-23 07:22:34] simonstewart: Because (hopefully) people will read up ahead of time
[2014-06-23 07:23:02] jimevans: also, can you refresh my memory about the reason for a rest-ish interface rather than a single http end point? i tried to remember your argument for that last week, and i'm afraid i botched it rather horribly.
[2014-06-23 07:23:33] papegaaij, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-06-23 07:25:26] simonstewart: Ha!
[2014-06-23 07:25:59] *jimevans should really write that down somewhere so he can remember it'
[2014-06-23 07:26:01] simonstewart: There were several, but the main reason is that having the session id in the URL makes it ridiculously simple to redirect JSON traffic without unpacking everything
[2014-06-23 07:26:11] simonstewart: And I believe that resources should be individually addressable
[2014-06-23 07:26:29] simonstewart: In the ideal world, I’d have gone full hypermedia
[2014-06-23 07:26:34] barancev|2: yes, the grid was the reason, iirc
[2014-06-23 07:26:47] simonstewart: And had your session return a set of links that could be used for “stuff"
[2014-06-23 07:26:59] simonstewart: But that would bake smarts into the client, and I’d prefer not to do that
[2014-06-23 07:27:17] simonstewart: So the RESTish approach is a compromise between pure REST and ease of implementation
[2014-06-23 07:28:00] barancev|2: but for the same "grid" reason only session id ir really important in the URL
[2014-06-23 07:28:45] simonstewart: True, but the REST reason means that I’d like resources to be addressable individually
[2014-06-23 07:29:24] barancev|2: yes, but we are RESTish :)
[2014-06-23 07:29:45] simonstewart: Only because we misuse the verbs and some of the state requriements
[2014-06-23 07:30:05] simonstewart: And the verbs is because I wanted to be able to write an HTML form to drive webdrivers

[2014-06-23 07:30:25] simonstewart: The original idea being that if you pointed a browser at the session URL you’d have an admin interface
[2014-06-23 07:30:43] simonstewart: Never implemented it, and I think that the MIME-type negotiation is now largely ignored
[2014-06-23 07:30:45] simonstewart: Bah!
[2014-06-23 07:30:56] jimevans: i guess my challenge is as a server-side implementer, i have to assemble my own json payload anyway, which breaks out the tokens from the url, even for operations implemented as "get" commands.
[2014-06-23 07:31:10] simonstewart: You’d need to do that anyway

[2014-06-23 07:31:51] jimevans: i'm thinking of the specifics of the IE driver at the moment.
[2014-06-23 07:32:04] simonstewart: k
[2014-06-23 07:33:06] jimevans: currently, we match on the url, extracting tokens as required, and stuff those into a hashmap ("locator parameters"), and grab the body of the request, if there is one, and stuff those into another hashmap ("command parameters").

Doesn't work on IE, several paths are hard-coded, cannot be built from the command line, and doesn't support all the commands that it should.

[2014-06-23 07:35:11] jimevans: of course, if we're planning on using the new MSFT-provided interface, we need to re-assemble everything into a single json payload that includes everything in one go. not insurmountable, of course, but a bit of a pain nevertheless.

[2014-06-23 08:07:12] HolyGoat: hm.. then in my case it doesn't work
[2014-06-23 08:08:07] numdig: sounds like you are having a data exchange problem like I did. we have to be asymetrical : we need the javascript executor to hack the HTML/DOM and then, and only then, we can use the standard Selenium API to retrieve the information we want

[2014-06-23 08:09:37] HolyGoat: what do you mean by having to be asymmetrical?
[2014-06-23 08:11:10] numdig: assymetrical because we use one technique on one side ( hacking the HTML/DOM using the generic Javascript executor ) and a different opposite one on the other ( reading the value using the standard Selenium API )
[2014-06-23 08:11:26] numdig: use the "Inspect Element" capabilitye of your browser to make sure that the data you are trying to retrieve was well written in the DOM

[2014-06-23 14:09:30] ato: Guest33220: Could be that your expecting n number of li items to load, which would mean you'd have to check that length(els) == 10.

[2014-06-23 16:11:42] Guest33220: french vanilla granola?
[2014-06-23 16:11:56] garndt: AutomatedTester: do you typically avoid grains?
[2014-06-23 16:12:02] Guest33220: i thought it was supposed to be high fiber anyways
[2014-06-23 16:12:06] Guest33220: woudln't you poop it out
[2014-06-23 16:12:08] garndt: Guest33220: crunchy flax granola
[2014-06-23 16:12:15] Guest33220: even mroe fiber
[2014-06-23 16:12:16] Guest33220: flaxseed
[2014-06-23 16:12:22] AutomatedTester: garndt: yea
[2014-06-23 16:12:40] garndt: AutomatedTester: I'm about 75% of the way there, except for my occasional relapse :(
[2014-06-23 16:12:41] garndt: working on it

[2014-06-23 16:13:05] AutomatedTester: garndt: I have lost ~30 pounds this year by avoiding grains
[2014-06-23 16:13:19] Guest33220: wutever happened to good old exercise and liposuction
[2014-06-23 16:13:23] garndt: That's awesome to hear.
[2014-06-23 16:13:45] garndt: I'm attempting to go along that same path
[2014-06-23 16:14:16] AutomatedTester: If I had more time to exercise I reckon I could lose the last ~7 pounds I want to lose
[2014-06-23 16:14:30] garndt: I first worked on just trying to consume better quality products and now I'm trying to reduce excess grains, sugar, and some other things.
[2014-06-23 16:14:43] garndt: Figure it can't hurt compared to my old take away habits
[2014-06-23 16:15:10] AutomatedTester: sugar and grains are the main one
[2014-06-23 16:16:06] AutomatedTester: I did paleo for a while but have moved to more of a low carb high fat diet
[2014-06-23 16:17:03] garndt: I had a moment with paleo, but I found that I had a harder time following it strictly
[2014-06-23 16:17:11] garndt: slow/low carb is definitely what I'm going after
[2014-06-23 16:18:07] garndt: <----weak will power sometimes

[2014-06-23 16:23:37] garndt: it's a shame that 3 of my favorite hobbies involves things that are (sometimes) not necessarily great for me .  Cooking, baking, and brewing beer.  My arduino never caused me to gain weight though!
[2014-06-23 16:24:18] AutomatedTester: garndt: swap the cooking/baking thing for things that fit your new way of eating
[2014-06-23 16:25:05] AutomatedTester: garndt: you can still have things like http://500px.com/photo/64977351/can-i-have-more-please-by-david-burns
[2014-06-23 16:25:10] garndt: yea, I'm working on learning how to cook healthier meals and then still enjoying myself when I do cheat once in awhile
[2014-06-23 16:25:16] AutomatedTester: but you remove nearly all the refined crap
[2014-06-23 16:25:36] garndt: oh my
[2014-06-23 16:26:03] AutomatedTester: the only "bad" thing in those is the dark chocolate

[2014-06-23 16:26:32] sooraj: hi, can anyone please help, i am new to selenium and testing, i want to select everything in a ace editor and replace it with something else. i tried id the element and click in it and select all but when i do that its selecting the whole page
[2014-06-23 16:26:35] garndt: awesome
[2014-06-23 16:26:37] AutomatedTester: garndt: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s63/sh/c0a89a3d-82ea-4c34-9e5d-58f10bde60dd/d2d5603842d3b83e8234315f0cd9a4ee
[2014-06-23 16:26:43] AutomatedTester: thats the recipe for you ;)
[2014-06-23 16:26:54] garndt: nice, thank you
[2014-06-23 16:27:17] AutomatedTester: sooraj: with webdriver?
[2014-06-23 16:27:24] sooraj: yes
[2014-06-23 16:28:04] AutomatedTester: sooraj: you will need to find the iframe that ace editor lives in and then do driver.switchTo.frame(<insert frame reference here>)
[2014-06-23 16:28:26] AutomatedTester: sooraj: and then do sendKeys(<ctrl + A>)
[2014-06-23 16:28:39] garndt: ah, this recipe has one of my all time favorite snacks...almond butter.  Love getting it freshly ground at the store.
[2014-06-23 16:29:02] AutomatedTester: wherever you see < > you will need to replace them with the information from your app or full webdriver commands
[2014-06-23 16:29:28] garndt: and, this recipe has just reminded me that the wife asked me to pick something up while I was at the store and I forgot to.  whoops.
[2014-06-23 16:30:14] sooraj: ok thanks, can you please give me an example of < >
[2014-06-23 16:30:27] AutomatedTester: 00:28 AutomatedTester: sooraj: and then do sendKeys(<ctrl + A>)
[2014-06-23 16:31:47] sooraj: thanks AutomatedTester
[2014-06-23 16:37:19] AutomatedTester: so I have found 2 things on Amazon that are ~£30 cheaper than from the manufacturers site
[2014-06-23 16:37:50] AutomatedTester: and its from ~£130 to ~£99
[2014-06-23 16:38:18] garndt: That's quite a bit of a difference

[2014-06-23 16:44:34] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-23 16:45:44] garndt: I think some of my headphones were much cheaper on there too.
[2014-06-23 16:46:20] AutomatedTester: garndt: yea, I want a sports watch and my Jawbone up has given up the ghost
[2014-06-23 16:46:31] AutomatedTester: so want to replace it with the new up24
[2014-06-23 16:47:28] garndt: Have you tried the fitbit or other products that are similar? Just curious because I've been thinking of investing in one.
[2014-06-23 16:47:51] AutomatedTester: the Up has a idle monitor which I like
[2014-06-23 16:48:34] garndt: Is the band comfortable?

[2014-06-23 16:48:55] AutomatedTester: I can get into a Flow State easily when coding
[2014-06-23 16:49:04] AutomatedTester: and staying too still is bad
[2014-06-23 16:49:43] garndt: Yea, if I get the proper music on and working on something it's very easy for me to get lost for a long time
[2014-06-23 16:50:05] garndt: I started to purposely drink  more water and find that it helps with that
[2014-06-23 16:50:32] AutomatedTester: so the Up is the only device, when I last looked that will vibrate after X minutes (which I set) if it thinks I have been idle
