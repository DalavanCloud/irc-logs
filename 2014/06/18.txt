[2014-06-18 03:36:55] barancev: but!
[2014-06-18 03:37:02] ato: Thanks for finding the culprit.
[2014-06-18 03:37:10] barancev: I can't understand how can it be the root cause
[2014-06-18 03:37:19] barancev: because it is a small python code change
[2014-06-18 03:37:33] barancev: I need a fresh view :)
[2014-06-18 03:37:36] ato: Yeah I'd guess it just triggers a problem underneath.
[2014-06-18 03:40:40] barancev: I suspect d834b32b04055cfee803932ff68836addecc5301 is the real root cause

[2014-06-18 09:00:31] jimevans: i guess i'm not seeing the distinction. it's still a threat to go elsewhere if it's not fixed, in an attempt to influence the bug getting faster attention because "OMG! we might lose a user!"

[2014-06-18 13:14:24] daemon: let me find out
[2014-06-18 13:14:33] dimacus: bc that;'s my best guess right now, no display to open firefox into

[2014-06-18 13:17:43] daemon: AutomatedTester, \o/ having issues with ports
[2014-06-18 13:17:51] daemon: when I start a new firefox session
[2014-06-18 13:17:58] daemon: selenium listens on 127.0.0.1:7054
[2014-06-18 13:18:05] dimacus: current theory is that webdriver is running on the port that FF is using to start on
[2014-06-18 13:18:06] daemon: and firefox is saying it wants to connect to 7055
[2014-06-18 13:18:17] daemon: so it times out

[2014-06-18 13:20:33] AutomatedTester: barancev: ^ any thoughts?
[2014-06-18 13:20:57] daemon: if I manually redirect 7055 via 'redir' it then tells firefox to connect to port 7056
[2014-06-18 13:21:10] daemon: likewise using pf to force redirect the port
[2014-06-18 13:21:28] daemon: oddly though, if I connect to 7054 (what java is listening on)
[2014-06-18 13:21:31] daemon: with telnet or netcat
[2014-06-18 13:21:34] daemon: it declines the connection
[2014-06-18 13:21:59] daemon: but irc, nginx and a whole suite of other programs are quite happy
[2014-06-18 13:22:01] dimacus: daemon: i might be wrong but i think 7054 is reserved for firefox
[2014-06-18 13:22:23] daemon: its just the first assigned back connect for selenium
[2014-06-18 13:22:24] dimacus: that's how webdriver knows the firefox started, it checks that port for firefox… what if you run the server on a different port such as 4444
[2014-06-18 13:22:28] daemon: whatever runs first is told to connect to it
[2014-06-18 13:22:45] daemon: the server IS running on 4444
[2014-06-18 13:22:50] daemon: when you launch a new session
[2014-06-18 13:22:56] daemon: selenium opens up a second port in the 7044 range
[2014-06-18 13:23:06] daemon: the web driver in firefox chrome or IE then connects back to that port
[2014-06-18 13:23:11] daemon: to alert selenium that the browser is started
[2014-06-18 13:23:21] daemon: for whatever reason when selenium is launching ff on my system
[2014-06-18 13:23:28] daemon: the port its telling it is +1 to what it really is

[2014-06-18 13:39:46] daemon: because I will tell selenium and firefox to hopefully use a totally different interface
[2014-06-18 13:39:52] daemon: see if that resolves this odd network behaviour
[2014-06-18 13:40:21] daemon: also it appears it wants to ignore what I tell it port wise as well -_- why does everything have to be an uphil sturggle gah.

[2014-06-18 15:27:18] phasze: had to downgrade my installation thanks to that bug
[2014-06-18 15:28:22] AutomatedTester: phasze: to escalate that bug it needs a way to reproduce it
[2014-06-18 15:28:34] daemon: hmm I wonder if I should submit mine
[2014-06-18 15:28:37] phasze: I thought someone provided that
[2014-06-18 15:28:46] daemon: Selenium works weird in virtualbox, think its worth it?

[2014-06-18 16:26:58] llc422: i'm trying to determine whether selenium is the right tool for what i want to do. i am looking to have it open a page in firefox, copy certain portions given xpath locations, and save those selections to a file. does selenium do that? so far i just know how to have it open a URL but not copy and data

[2014-06-18 16:45:15] deadAnimal: for that particular use case, it's fine.
[2014-06-18 16:45:21] deadAnimal: maybe.
[2014-06-18 16:46:28] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-06-18 16:46:39] deadAnimal: it depends on what else you need to do. static page with xpath only? most likely it's fine. Then you see things like random timeouts even when using polling (because even polling is not thread safe as browser state may have changed by the time you start actually polling.  Maybe a checkbox was checked and unchecked 20 times via javascript)
[2014-06-18 16:46:51] deadAnimal: fundamentally, selenium has some major flaws that do need to be addressed
[2014-06-18 16:47:41] llc422: thanks
[2014-06-18 16:48:02] llc422: but how do i get selenium to save to an external file?
[2014-06-18 16:48:08] deadAnimal: i'm guess your use case, since i'm assuming things, is not QA but using selenium to automate some task you don't like to do
[2014-06-18 16:48:11] llc422: for example a file for all the catalog numbers it scrapes
[2014-06-18 16:48:24] deadAnimal: llc422: you can use Java or c# or whatever language you want forthat
[2014-06-18 16:48:51] deadAnimal: selenium's only file support is making downloading automatic
[2014-06-18 16:48:59] deadAnimal: such as when you click a download link
[2014-06-18 16:49:10] deadAnimal: it won't prompt you to save it and if it's safe and blah blah blah
[2014-06-18 16:49:35] llc422: ok i plan on using python. so i need to have python grab the different elements i want
[2014-06-18 16:49:48] deadAnimal: selenium grabs the xpath and the values at the xpath
[2014-06-18 16:49:53] deadAnimal: python does the file save
[2014-06-18 16:50:22] llc422: is there some tutorial or documentation on how to save the stuff selenium grabs?
[2014-06-18 16:50:31] deadAnimal: something like By.xpath("//.here/is/some/path/to/stuff/I/Want/To/put/in/file").getAttribute("value")
[2014-06-18 16:50:54] deadAnimal: above line is only for textareas with attribute that has a value
[2014-06-18 16:51:04] deadAnimal: you can use .getText or whatever else there is in the api
[2014-06-18 16:51:14] deadAnimal: python file management?
[2014-06-18 16:51:42] llc422: ok cool. that will put me on the right path
[2014-06-18 16:51:44] llc422: thanks
[2014-06-18 16:52:24] deadAnimal:       fileHandle = open ( ‘somefile’, ‘w’ )       fileHandle.write ( ‘now there is shit in the file )
[2014-06-18 16:52:35] deadAnimal: whoops forgot a close parentheses
[2014-06-18 16:52:53] deadAnimal: fileHandle.close() you're done
[2014-06-18 16:53:40] llc422: thanks so much
[2014-06-18 16:53:46] llc422: i will work on it and see what i can do
[2014-06-18 16:53:52] deadAnimal: good luck
[2014-06-18 16:54:17] deadAnimal: hope you are successful with automating your task (probably not a good idea to use selenium for QA IMHO however)
[2014-06-18 16:54:41] deadAnimal: you could even use a curl/http library to just take raw html and process the raw html string
