[2014-05-25 14:29:14] ato: I just landed a patch for Java 8 support in Selenium a couple of weeks ago from a contributor, so Java 8 hasn't been extensively tested.
[2014-05-25 14:29:25] ato: Yeah, that's all good (-:
[2014-05-25 14:30:25] ato: The testing we've done so far extends to “it compiles”.

[2014-05-25 14:36:45] damnuselenium12: hi
[2014-05-25 14:39:15] barancev: WillPittenger: you can also look at https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-extensions/blob/master/webdriver-wrapper/src/main/java/ru/stqa/selenium/wrapper/UnhandledAlertHandlingWrapper.java
[2014-05-25 14:39:49] damnuselenium12: i've been trying to get selenium running with python for the last 12 hours lol, i selenium won't install through pip, and fails with the same error when running the repository version (14.04)
[2014-05-25 14:40:24] ato: damnuselenium12: What error is that?
[2014-05-25 14:40:33] damnuselenium12: i'm asking here because all of my searching on google and so comes up with this was solved a while ago lol
[2014-05-25 14:43:34] damnuselenium12: http://pastebin.com/9shdUNRj
[2014-05-25 14:43:49] damnuselenium12: it's not a huge dump, 14 lines
[2014-05-25 14:44:07] damnuselenium12: the exact same error comes up when i install it from the repositories instead, and try to invoke from python
[2014-05-25 14:44:23] barancev: using EventFiringWebDriver is not the best idea to deal with alerts, especially unhandled onces
[2014-05-25 14:44:45] damnuselenium12: the same error is thrown by python with "from selenium import webdriver"
[2014-05-25 14:44:56] barancev: damnuselenium12: use python 2.7
[2014-05-25 14:45:16] ato: damnuselenium12: You're trying to install it on Python 3.
[2014-05-25 14:45:31] ato: damnuselenium12: I just fixed that exact bug a few days ago, and the fix should be in the next version.
[2014-05-25 14:45:46] damnuselenium12: i'll try that thanks, the reason for python3 is selenium is actually a dependency for something else, which is python3 only
[2014-05-25 14:45:55] barancev: nope
[2014-05-25 14:46:18] barancev: it is 2.7 compatible
[2014-05-25 14:46:25] damnuselenium12: the main program i'm trying to install is python3 anyway, not selenium
[2014-05-25 14:46:42] damnuselenium12: i'll try that though
[2014-05-25 14:47:00] damnuselenium12: thanks, i'll run this whole thing through 2.7
[2014-05-25 14:47:16] ato: Sorry for the inconvenience. |-:
[2014-05-25 14:47:23] ato: We should really get Python 3 running on the CI.
[2014-05-25 14:48:46] damnuselenium12: don't be it looks awesome i'll solve it; it's the parser that's using selenium that has no docs lol
[2014-05-25 14:49:22] WillPittenger: barancev: Is there a JAR for that?
