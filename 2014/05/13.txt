[2014-05-13 07:34:04] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not sure. does the venue have anything to do with it? i don't know if that's standard operating procedure for conferences in other parts of the world.
[2014-05-13 07:34:36] AutomatedTester: Ensure you provide links to:  "previous conference talks" <- what if this is your first recorded talk or public talk?
[2014-05-13 07:34:57] jimevans: or if diversity of presenters is "less important" because of that. (it's important to me, but i wonder about the evaluation committee)

[2014-05-13 07:36:29] jimevans: it's also pretty unclear at this point about the types of sessions they're expecting to have. (20 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60-90 minutes?) that sounds really confusing to me.

[2014-05-13 09:24:28] santiycr: maybe we can increase logging to get more insights into whats going on with the driver?
[2014-05-13 09:24:38] jimevans: that's pretty easy.
[2014-05-13 09:24:40] santiycr: if you can repro this reliably, we could always get to the vm by hand
[2014-05-13 09:24:54] jimevans: yeah, if it were reliably, i'd be done already. :)
[2014-05-13 09:25:09] santiycr: :)
[2014-05-13 09:25:51] jimevans: lukeis: can you log into jenkins and bump the IE driver log for the IE10 java tests job?
[2014-05-13 09:26:34] santiycr: I think this may require sauce changes?
[2014-05-13 09:26:37] santiycr: let me check
[2014-05-13 09:26:42] lukeis: bump how?
[2014-05-13 09:26:58] lukeis: USE_SAUCE=true SAUCE_OS=Win8 SAUCE_BROWSER_VERSION=10 SAUCE_JOB_NAME=jenkins-r$svnrevision-IE-10 REQUIRE_FOCUS=true ./go test_ie offline=true haltonerror=false haltonfailure=false log=true
[2014-05-13 09:27:01] jimevans: isn't there a capability that we pass over that has the IEDriverServer log level?
[2014-05-13 09:27:02] lukeis: is the line it uses
[2014-05-13 09:27:11] jimevans: i guess not then
[2014-05-13 09:27:17] santiycr: we use this:
[2014-05-13 09:27:21] santiycr:             sel_args.append('-Dwebdriver.ie.driver.logfile=%s' % automator_log_path)
[2014-05-13 09:27:21] santiycr:             sel_args.append('-Dwebdriver.ie.driver.loglevel=INFO')
[2014-05-13 09:27:35] santiycr: jimevans:  which level you think would help here?
[2014-05-13 09:27:45] lukeis: DEBUG! :)
[2014-05-13 09:27:48] santiycr: is DEBUG insane?
[2014-05-13 09:27:50] jimevans: well, you've got debug and trace left.
[2014-05-13 09:27:54] santiycr: cuz I may just turn it for all users
[2014-05-13 09:27:55] jimevans: debug isn't insane; trace is.
[2014-05-13 09:28:13] santiycr: I can maybe make trace happen only for the selenium-ci account
[2014-05-13 09:28:27] santiycr: worst case scenario, we make a 1GB file on every test?
[2014-05-13 09:28:28] JamesPrescott, quitting. (Quit: Logging off)
[2014-05-13 09:28:29] santiycr: :P
[2014-05-13 09:28:52] lukeis: disk space is infinite though right? ;)
[2014-05-13 09:29:07] santiycr: what is disk space? :P
[2014-05-13 09:29:27] jimevans: i've got a change i'm nearly ready to push anyway. let me know when i should, and we can let the next run pick up the config change.
[2014-05-13 09:30:33] santiycr: jimevans: you know you can also give Sauce custom IEDriver binaries, right?
[2014-05-13 09:30:44] santiycr: I think (hope?) that's how the build runs
[2014-05-13 09:30:59] jimevans: yep. that's how it works now. it picks up latest from prebuilt.
[2014-05-13 09:31:06] santiycr: so maybe you can build one with trace on independently of flags
[2014-05-13 09:31:18] santiycr: that would allow you get more feedback without waiting for me to deploy this change
[2014-05-13 09:31:28] santiycr: jimevans:  ah, awesomeness
[2014-05-13 09:31:58] lukeis: export SAUCE_SELENIUM_VERSION="sauce-storage:selenium-server-$svnrevision.jar"   export SAUCE_IEDRIVER_VERSION="sauce-storage:IEDriverServer-Win32-$svnrevision.zip"   :)
[2014-05-13 09:32:07] santiycr: sweet
[2014-05-13 09:32:47] santiycr: yeah, building all that magic dynamic pulling of every automation part wasn't particularly fun

[2014-05-13 09:33:57] santiycr: the bigger the company, the more custom stuff they eventually need
[2014-05-13 09:34:00] lukeis: yeah, i believe we use an aspect of it here too :)
[2014-05-13 09:34:02] santiycr: to the point they build their own jars and all
[2014-05-13 09:34:55] santiycr: that's what building a Selenium cloud for 5 full years gets you

[2014-05-13 09:41:48] jimevans: santiycr: so i'm ready to push this commit, if you think we can bump the logging for IEDriverServe.r
[2014-05-13 09:42:21] jimevans: did sevaseva get java updated on the CI build machine? he said he might get to it yesterday.
[2014-05-13 09:42:23] santiycr: jimevans:  I can bump it, but will require us deploying, which won't happen right now
[2014-05-13 09:42:32] jimevans: meh, alright.
[2014-05-13 09:42:37] jimevans: i won't wait then.
[2014-05-13 09:42:58] santiycr: (see my previous comment on potentially just making iedriver do TRACE independently of the cmd line flags sent)

[2014-05-13 09:43:50] santiycr: I'll push this change now into Sauce
[2014-05-13 09:43:51] lukeis: jimevans: why not? :) you can push and then immediately revert
[2014-05-13 09:44:04] santiycr: making all users get DEBUG, selenium-ci get TRACE
[2014-05-13 09:44:19] jimevans: lukeis: because i've got too many other things i need to do.
[2014-05-13 09:44:24] lukeis: ;)

[2014-05-13 10:09:05] jimevans: otherwise, they'll fail miserably.
[2014-05-13 10:09:25] jimevans: because they think they're running on firefox
[2014-05-13 10:09:28] jleyba: everyone gets "latest" here. trunk based development and everyone builds from head
[2014-05-13 10:09:29] jleyba: love it!
[2014-05-13 10:10:32] jimevans: that's great, as long as you own all the dependencies and can keep them perpetually in sync with their latest versions.
[2014-05-13 10:12:19] jimevans: but goog.userAgent.IE returns false on IE11 using the version of closure checked into third_party (because it explicitly looks for "MSIE" in the UA string). latest closure fixes that, but can't be built on the version of java we have installed on the CI machine.

[2014-05-13 11:57:42] jimevans: golangdude: selenium webdriver works in a completely different way than selenium rc. it amounts to an entirely different architecture for automating the browser.
[2014-05-13 11:58:46] lukeis: you can do it with a Proxy, there's a few blog posts out there that describe exactly how to do so
[2014-05-13 11:59:04] jimevans: the methods used by selenium rc meant that it acted as a proxy in some circumstances, being in between the browser and the web server hosting the site.
[2014-05-13 11:59:16] jimevans: since it was acting as a proxy, it could capture all network traffic.
[2014-05-13 11:59:20] jimevans: here's the thing though
[2014-05-13 11:59:26] jimevans: proxies are complex things
[2014-05-13 11:59:43] jimevans: they're tricky to get right
[2014-05-13 11:59:54] jimevans: with a fair number of edge cases involved.
[2014-05-13 12:00:32] jimevans: the team developing webdriver decided it would be better to be a library good at browser automation, and not act at all as a proxy, than to be a library that was half-assed at both.
[2014-05-13 12:01:04] jimevans: this is particularly true when there are a number of good proxy projects already available. open-source ones too!

[2014-05-13 12:02:02] jimevans: rather, the project make it pretty easy to set the proxy settings of the browser being automated to be whatever proxy you'd want to use, and that includes one that can be started at will, programmatically, and can capture all of the the network traffic you could want, also programmatically.
[2014-05-13 12:02:10] jimevans: so that's why.
