[2014-05-03 13:34:08] PANDA__: i'm just getting started with selenium
[2014-05-03 13:34:13] Zeukkari: why cambridge ?
[2014-05-03 13:34:23] PANDA__: IRC is part of my immersion into learning
[2014-05-03 13:34:29] PANDA__: that's where I am
[2014-05-03 13:34:46] Zeukkari: neat
[2014-05-03 13:34:57] PANDA__: I just finished my last full-time semester in my MS Mathematics program and am now looking to get a job doing web testing and automation
[2014-05-03 13:35:41] PANDA__: so now I am going to live, breathe and sleep selenium
[2014-05-03 13:35:59] PANDA__: I'm looking for good video tutorials, do you know if the QTP testing ones are any good?
[2014-05-03 13:36:23] Zeukkari: can't comment on video tutorials

[2014-05-03 13:37:03] Zeukkari: i stuck to the offical documentation, google and banging my head to the wall
[2014-05-03 13:37:10] PANDA__: nice
[2014-05-03 13:37:14] PANDA__: any good forums?

[2014-05-03 13:37:45] PANDA__: that's a good idea
[2014-05-03 13:38:11] PANDA__: i always get there through google for specific questions but maybe i should go to the main site for once and search for selenium
[2014-05-03 13:38:56] PANDA__: do you use Python bindings?
