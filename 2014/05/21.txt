[2014-05-21 01:07:47] cgoldberg: what does frozen browser mean, and what code got it into that state?
[2014-05-21 01:12:01] kingplusplus: cgoldberg, get_contact_url(url) returns a list of possible contact pages for for a given website... so when it was parsed this http://www.cnilike.cn/ it prints bunch of urls to screen (that is url that it assumes are contact url) which is expected but at some point it stops because browser is frozen whil trying to open one of the URL

EventFiringWebDriver isn't a RemoteWebDriver.

[2014-05-21 14:02:58] WillPittenger: It all uses the findBy* functions.
[2014-05-21 14:03:04] lukeis: you could always extend EventFiring and add that it implements FindsBy* interfaces
[2014-05-21 14:03:15] WillPittenger: I may.
