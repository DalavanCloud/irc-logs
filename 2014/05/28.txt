[2014-05-28 06:41:19] Jaro: I've been having an issue with Selenium WebDriver 2 and I'm kind of stuck on what to do.

[2014-05-28 06:42:34] Jaro: but I did
[2014-05-28 06:42:40] Jaro: and have done so for the past 8 months

[2014-05-28 06:42:49] Jaro: :/
[2014-05-28 06:42:59] jimevans: Jaro: what version of firefox, and what version of webdriver?
[2014-05-28 06:43:01] livestrong: Hi
[2014-05-28 06:43:31] Jaro: Sel Version 2.41.0 I believe
[2014-05-28 06:44:30] jimevans: Jaro: what version of firefox?
[2014-05-28 06:44:38] jimevans: also what language bindings are you using?
[2014-05-28 06:44:42] dcboycm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-28 06:45:57] Jaro: Sorry for the delay: Version of firefox 27.0.1
[2014-05-28 06:46:03] Jaro: And I'm using Java
[2014-05-28 06:46:13] Jaro: I think it might have something to do with iframes
[2014-05-28 06:46:18] livestrong: I have a page with multiple products and an "add to cart" button for each product. If the product name is not in my list, I have to click on its add to cart button, make the checkout and go back to the page with products and repeat the process
[2014-05-28 06:46:20] Jaro: As right before it starts happening
[2014-05-28 06:46:31] Jaro: An iframe was used for a connection with an external site
[2014-05-28 06:46:48] Jaro: oops, not 27.0.1, but 29.0.1*
[2014-05-28 06:47:01] livestrong: How to I click on all buttons and how do I check if the product's name is not in my list before click the button?
[2014-05-28 06:47:06] livestrong: how do*
[2014-05-28 06:47:41] jimevans: Jaro: try updating to 2.42. it probably won't make a difference, but you'll want a version of webdriver that explicitly supports the version of firefox you're using.
[2014-05-28 06:47:59] Jaro: Okay, I will
[2014-05-28 06:48:08] Jaro: It started happening fairly recently, and fairly sporadic
[2014-05-28 06:48:27] Jaro: So I was quite confused after having those tests run fine for 8 months every 4 hours
[2014-05-28 06:48:37] jimevans: the next thing you'll be asked for is a reproducible case, just so you can prepare for that.

[2014-05-28 06:48:51] Jaro: The thing is
[2014-05-28 06:48:56] Jaro: it doesn't happen every time
[2014-05-28 06:48:59] Jaro: Just randomly

[2014-05-28 06:50:52] jimevans: :kittens
[2014-05-28 06:50:52] selbot2: Before you say you cannot provide html, think of the kittens! http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html
[2014-05-28 06:50:54] Jaro: I know
[2014-05-28 06:51:07] Jaro: I was hoping it was a more common issue
[2014-05-28 06:51:13] Jaro: and I was just overlooking the docs
[2014-05-28 06:51:14] Jaro: :p
[2014-05-28 06:51:21] Jaro: But I'll update the drivers
[2014-05-28 06:51:25] Jaro: and see if it keeps happening
[2014-05-28 06:51:35] Jaro: if it does, I'll try and make a reproducing test
[2014-05-28 06:51:39] Jaro: small enough to debug
[2014-05-28 06:52:02] Jaro: 'til then
[2014-05-28 06:52:06] Jaro: have a good day
[2014-05-28 06:52:11] jimevans: even if it happens sporadically, say, one in 100 times, just providing a test case that loops 100 times and triggers the bug once within that time would help.

[2014-05-28 07:00:43] livestrong: Some ideas with my question? I have multiple products with "Add to cart" button on a page. If the product's name is not in my list, I need to click add to cart, then check out then go back to the products.
[2014-05-28 07:01:07] livestrong: How I click on all buttons? How I can make the link between a product name and it's button? If the name is on my list, to skip that button
[2014-05-28 07:01:53] jimevans: livestrong: how are the products listed in the HTML markup? in a table?
[2014-05-28 07:02:39] livestrong: jimevans: yes, there is a table. Each product is on a raw
[2014-05-28 07:03:10] jimevans: then find the cell with the product you're looking for, and find its corresponding button using xpath.
[2014-05-28 07:03:19] OscarRieken: find row => find "add to cart" => click
[2014-05-28 07:03:51] jimevans: (ordinarily, i shy away from recommending xpath, but this is one time where i don't think you can avoid it)
[2014-05-28 07:04:02] acke, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-05-28 07:04:18] livestrong: so I will find all rows by xpath, and for each result, find the name, compare it and then click the button or skip it
[2014-05-28 07:04:19] livestrong: ?
[2014-05-28 07:04:37] jimevans: (because you have to walk the DOM from the <td> containing the product name, up to the <tr>, then back down to the <td> containing the button)
[2014-05-28 07:04:50] jimevans: livestrong: that's one way to do it.
[2014-05-28 07:05:22] jimevans: probably not the way i would approach it, but it would probably work.
[2014-05-28 07:05:56] jimevans: it kinda depends. if clicking on the add button means you have to navigate to another page (like the shopping cart page) i almost certainly wouldn't do it that way.
[2014-05-28 07:06:31] livestrong: yeah, it's going on another page after clicking on add to cart
[2014-05-28 07:06:40] livestrong: how you suggest to do it in this case?
[2014-05-28 07:06:58] jimevans: how are you locating the rows now?
[2014-05-28 07:07:24] livestrong: I haven't made anything yet, just thinking how to do it :)
[2014-05-28 07:08:05] jimevans: then i've given you as much guidance as i'm willing to at the moment.
[2014-05-28 07:10:02] livestrong: ok, thank you. I will try to see how is working the way I said :)

[2014-05-28 09:49:52] jimevans: and how are you deleting that stuff via a batch file?
[2014-05-28 09:50:04] simonstewart: From orbit
[2014-05-28 09:50:09] simonstewart: It’s the only way to be sure
[2014-05-28 09:50:36] jleyba: pretty much
[2014-05-28 09:50:55] jleyba: start server with -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=iedriver.bat
[2014-05-28 09:51:10] jleyba: .bat nukes various directories before starting IEDriverServer.exe
[2014-05-28 09:51:12] jimevans: yes but what does the batch file *do*?
[2014-05-28 09:51:22] jleyba: del /f /q /s %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\*
[2014-05-28 09:51:24] jimevans: so, you're guessing. i see.
[2014-05-28 09:51:38] jimevans: that's fair

[2014-05-28 09:51:51] dimacus: jleyba: i'm highly interested in what you are doing there, if you figure it out please let me have the bat file

[2014-05-28 09:54:11] jimevans: whereas "rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 2559" does all that work
[2014-05-28 09:54:32] jleyba: right, but believe it or not that .bat is several seconds faster
[2014-05-28 09:54:38] jimevans: not surprised.
[2014-05-28 09:54:40] jimevans: the other does more.
[2014-05-28 09:55:47] jimevans: it clears the following: history, cookies, Temp Internet Files folder, offline favorites and download history, saved form data for form auto-fill-in, saved passwords, phishing filter data, webpage recovery data, and tracking data.
[2014-05-28 09:56:53] jimevans: either you want a clean session, or you don't. :)

[2014-05-28 09:58:41] jleyba: Right...sorry
[2014-05-28 09:58:42] jimevans: if you added that, it *wouldn't* use multithreading to do the delete
[2014-05-28 09:59:40] jimevans: but, if you only cared about a few of those things, you could do "rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 7"
[2014-05-28 09:59:51] jimevans: which would give you history, cookies and temp internet files.
[2014-05-28 10:01:22] jimevans: also, you need to be aware of difference between the medium integrity level cache/cookie store and the low integrity level cache/cookie store.
[2014-05-28 10:01:59] jleyba: del /f /q /s %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\* gets them both
[2014-05-28 10:02:04] jleyba: low integrity is in Cookies\Low

[2014-05-28 11:34:01] Voyage: lukeis,  the javascript query works ok with firefoxdriver. but gives the stated error if the same code is ran with phantomjs
[2014-05-28 11:34:49] lukeis: yes, have you tried to manually run that jquery script with phantomjs (without webdriver)
[2014-05-28 11:35:17] lukeis: phantomjs !== firefox  (especially with the javascript engine)
[2014-05-28 11:35:37] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-05-28 11:35:48] Voyage: manually run? am.. well  do you want me to make up a page and run this script in console?

[2014-05-28 11:36:20] Voyage: lukeis,  but phantomjs and firefox should run the js in similar way. no?

[2014-05-28 11:36:35] lukeis: obviously you've hit one of the points where they aren't ;)
[2014-05-28 11:36:42] Voyage: lukeis,  the same pages is reached by several walkthroughs, redirects and logins
[2014-05-28 11:37:04] Voyage: lukeis,  something.click() should not be that point though i think
[2014-05-28 11:37:22] lukeis: something.click() is actually the jQuery library function at this point
[2014-05-28 11:37:50] jimevans: Voyage: in all likelihood, the click() is probably not what's failing. it's probably the locator leading up to that.
[2014-05-28 11:37:50] lukeis: you sure jQuery has made sure they are 100% compatible with phantom's?
[2014-05-28 11:37:56] Voyage: lukeis, and the #phantomjs guys said that selenium wraps the .executeScript() it is own way . that not pure phantom
[2014-05-28 11:38:25] lukeis: yes, "undefined" is not a method… meaning the [0] being returned does not have a "click" method
[2014-05-28 11:38:35] Voyage: jimevans,  hm. yes.  I think. but why the locater is failing
[2014-05-28 11:39:05] lukeis: your bug is in the javascript itself… what i'm trying to suggest is remove webdriver as the factor to figure it out
[2014-05-28 11:39:31] jimevans: Voyage: i have no earthly idea. could be any of a number of things. jquery incompatibility. that the object you're getting back from jquery isn't an element like you think it is. that phantomjs just plain renders the DOM differently. i really couldn't say.
[2014-05-28 11:39:52] Voyage: lukeis,  well, I said that the same script works perfect if I use firefoxdriver
[2014-05-28 11:40:01] jimevans: Voyage: we're talking in circles.
[2014-05-28 11:40:12] lukeis: phantomjs does not equal firefox
[2014-05-28 11:40:24] lukeis: completely different javascript engines
[2014-05-28 11:40:25] Voyage: got it.
[2014-05-28 11:40:26] jimevans: let me ask you this: is phantomjs the same browser as firefox?
[2014-05-28 11:40:31] Voyage: hm i got it

[2014-05-28 11:41:20] jimevans: lukeis: +1, especially with respect to javascript engine.
[2014-05-28 11:41:46] Voyage: jimevans,  lukeis  i think that it cannot _reach_ the element...[0] thing.  why that element is not visible to it by javascript. I think then that jquery is not used by phantom. i mean that version of jquery that the page has

[2014-05-28 12:43:23] jimevans: DeLorean731: so, what's failing? and that looks suspiciously like raw javascript.
[2014-05-28 12:44:01] DeLorean731: jimevans, jarib: So yes, that is raw javascript. That javascript returns the element I want, I'm trying to write the python-selenium code that will capture the same element!

[2014-05-28 12:45:25] jimevans: and that might not be correct python
[2014-05-28 12:45:28] DeLorean731: it is, that javascript snags the right element
[2014-05-28 12:45:54] jimevans: well, yeah, but it's possible you could be executing it from within a nested frame too.
[2014-05-28 12:45:54] jarib: well, isn't a DOM NodeList 0-indexed, and switch_to_frame 1-indexed?
[2014-05-28 12:46:23] jimevans: jarib: it's not in some languages. java and .NET it's specifically 0-based

[2014-05-28 12:47:23] jarib: DeLorean731: perhaps you need .switch_to_frame(2) - it's not clear from the docs whether it's 0-indexed or 1-indexed in python

[2014-05-28 13:03:01] jimevans: DeLorean731: what browser are you using?
[2014-05-28 13:03:10] DeLorean731: jimevans: Chrome
[2014-05-28 13:03:15] Voyage: jimevans,  I understand
[2014-05-28 13:03:16] jimevans: does it happen only in one, or in multiple browsers?
[2014-05-28 13:03:40] DeLorean731: jimevans: let me verify
[2014-05-28 13:03:49] *jimevans wonders if chromedriver is doing something monumentally stupid like ignoring hidden iframes'
[2014-05-28 13:04:23] AutomatedTester: jimevans: frames are hard dude...
[2014-05-28 13:04:33] jimevans: yeah, i know.

[2014-05-28 13:05:27] *jimevans is on the same network as lukeis'
[2014-05-28 13:06:42] lukeis: the current issue with the sample provided is to do the action he's having trouble with, it's rendered after an ajax call...
[2014-05-28 13:07:13] jimevans: so, waits?
[2014-05-28 13:07:14] lukeis: and guess what I'm not running their server to handle said ajax request ;)
[2014-05-28 13:07:20] lukeis: possibly...
[2014-05-28 13:07:21] jimevans: :)
[2014-05-28 13:07:26] lukeis: but it's too hard to tell
[2014-05-28 13:07:42] DeLorean731: jimevans: Firefox locks up when I run that code... IE says "Errno 10053 connection aborted"
[2014-05-28 13:08:48] DeLorean731: jimevans, Firefox seems to lock up after "loginElem.click()"
[2014-05-28 13:10:37] Voyage: lukeis,  so even the ajax is there, it creates a UL LI. I just click it by javascript
[2014-05-28 13:10:39] Voyage: The "From" field when click makes a drop down window like thing. it has a <UR> and a <LI>. I am clicking that <LI> by the said javascipt.
[2014-05-28 13:11:08] andrey_: Regarding switch_to_window: I have a lot of intermittent failures in my test suite for window API (https://travis-ci.org/jnicklas/capybara/builds/26244843). I think they are caused by the fact that switch_to_window doesn't wait for window to be switched.
[2014-05-28 13:11:55] andrey_: I reproduced those failures for Chromedriver and reported bug there - https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=769
[2014-05-28 13:12:38] andrey_: I haven't been able to reproduce those intermittent failures for FirefoxDriver locally.

[2014-05-28 13:19:10] andrey_: jimevans: yes
[2014-05-28 13:19:19] jimevans: your bug report seems to do so.
[2014-05-28 13:21:02] andrey_: the issue in bug is that "switch_to.window" was invoked "resize_to" didn't lead to window resize. see?

[2014-05-28 13:24:49] DeLorean731: You have to use implicit waits right?

[2014-05-28 13:27:01] DeLorean731: andrey_: and I don't think explicit waits work in this situation, but the implicit example doesn't seem to actually wait at all
[2014-05-28 13:27:49] andrey_: Webdriver's implicit/explicit waits won't help in situation like described Chromedriver's bug.
[2014-05-28 13:28:11] DeLorean731: andrey_: Oh okay, then how did you pause?
[2014-05-28 13:28:41] andrey_: sleep

[2014-05-28 13:36:13] HMH: Hi, quick quesiton. Is there any way to get symbol files for the pre-compiled IEDriverServer releases?
[2014-05-28 13:36:21] jimevans: HMH: nope
[2014-05-28 13:36:29] HMH: :(
[2014-05-28 13:36:42] jimevans: pretty easy to build though.
[2014-05-28 13:37:03] jarib: andrey_: it's kind of hard to understand the spec that's failing in your travis link
[2014-05-28 13:37:42] jarib: andrey_: when i read 'should raise error if default_wait_time is less than timeout', it seems to me that this is something that could be tested without invoking any webdriver call
[2014-05-28 13:37:45] jimevans: HMH: and if you have specific questions or problems with the IE driver, i might be able to help.
[2014-05-28 13:38:00] HMH: Ok, I was trying to help someone who is getting an AV crash in IEDriverServer using 2.40 and 2.41, but not much to go on at this point.
[2014-05-28 13:38:16] jimevans: doing what, exactly. one was fixed in 2.42
[2014-05-28 13:38:34] jarib: andrey_: i.e. it could compare the timeouts and immediately raise, and never even invoke the block passed to window_opened_by
[2014-05-28 13:39:15] HMH: No consistent repro for the crash at this time.
[2014-05-28 13:39:32] jarib: andrey_: i may be misunderstanding what's actually being tested, but then the spec descriptions should probably be improved
[2014-05-28 13:39:36] HMH: So I was hoping the crash dump could give me a hint to narrow it down.
[2014-05-28 13:39:45] jimevans: if it has to do with openinig popup windows, have them update to 2.42.0.
[2014-05-28 13:40:11] HMH: Ok, I'll see if they can run their test automation using 2.42 as well.
[2014-05-28 13:40:33] HMH: Is there a link describing the issue with popup windows that was fixed in 2.42?

[2014-05-28 13:44:09] jarib: andrey_: also, what version of chromedriver? the code in #769 passes for me with 2.10.267517

[2014-05-28 13:44:45] jimevans: no problem.
[2014-05-28 13:45:34] jarib: uh, sorry - i meant chromedriver#769

[2014-05-28 13:46:54] andrey_: jarib: actually the spec 'should raise error if default_wait_time is less than timeout' should raise error if "timeout set using Javascript's setTimeout is less than Capybara.default_wait_time that is set to 0.4 in this scenario.
[2014-05-28 13:47:15] jarib: ah, ok
[2014-05-28 13:47:37] jarib: who's calling setTimeout, and for what purpose?
[2014-05-28 13:47:45] andrey_: jarib: however, the failure I linked to is with spec at row 18 of window_opened_by_spec.rb
[2014-05-28 13:48:20] andrey_: jarib: do you me to answer your question?
[2014-05-28 13:48:34] jarib: nope, i must've misread
[2014-05-28 13:49:08] jarib: though the chromedriver version may still be relevant

[2014-05-28 13:54:58] andrey_: jarib: yes
[2014-05-28 13:57:18] jarib: wouldn't the spec be less likely to fail if you (a) passed an empty block or (b) set the wait time to 0?
[2014-05-28 13:57:45] jarib: or - is the low wait time preventing the exception from being raised?
[2014-05-28 13:58:03] jarib: i.e. the synchronize { ... } block never even executes?
[2014-05-28 13:58:42] andrey_: jarib: actually I posted to this IRC chat the first intermittent failure without looking if it has something to do with "switch_to_window". Actually this spec failure wasn't an indicator of a bug in Selenium. It occured just because code works too slowly on Travis. I think increasing waiting times/timeouts etc. will solve this particular spec failure. Sorry, for disturbing you with such a simple case.
[2014-05-28 13:59:01] jarib: ok, no worries
