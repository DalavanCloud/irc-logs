[2014-05-30 05:54:49] gnoze5: how do I access it
[2014-05-30 05:55:01] gnoze5: what I mean is, I dont want do download the fiel directly
[2014-05-30 05:55:07] cgoldberg: gnoze5, ah
[2014-05-30 05:55:17] cgoldberg: why not?
[2014-05-30 05:56:00] cgoldberg: and are you really concerned that a file "downloads correctly"?  what are you actually testing?

[2014-05-30 05:56:41] gnoze5: im actually testing the integrity of a JS file
[2014-05-30 05:57:01] gnoze5: because I am having random stuff happening 1 out of 100 times
[2014-05-30 05:57:06] cgoldberg: so download the file and assert whatever you want
[2014-05-30 05:57:10] gnoze5: well
[2014-05-30 05:57:32] gnoze5: I want to check the file when the random ui event happens
[2014-05-30 05:58:00] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-30 05:58:20] cgoldberg: gnoze5, a file is a file is a file.  the JS might update the DOM to change it... but the underlying js is just static code/text
[2014-05-30 05:59:15] cgoldberg: sounds like it's the page source you are after, not the JS
[2014-05-30 05:59:21] gnoze5: agreed, i just want to match the two
[2014-05-30 05:59:24] gnoze5: no, not at all
[2014-05-30 05:59:29] gnoze5: the source is intact in every instance
[2014-05-30 05:59:40] gnoze5: in the rare occasions we replicated the issue
[2014-05-30 05:59:44] cgoldberg: how would the JS not be intact?
[2014-05-30 05:59:47] gnoze5: there was always a js filemessed up
[2014-05-30 05:59:56] cgoldberg: messed up means what?
[2014-05-30 06:00:01] gnoze5: means cut in half
[2014-05-30 06:00:08] cgoldberg: ah.. interesting
[2014-05-30 06:00:26] gnoze5: and this is consistent , obviously, with the messed up ui
[2014-05-30 06:00:34] gnoze5: hence why i wanted to check
[2014-05-30 06:00:36] gnoze5: for stuff like
[2014-05-30 06:00:40] gnoze5: if its always cut in the same place
[2014-05-30 06:00:47] gnoze5: or if its always the samefile
[2014-05-30 06:00:49] cgoldberg: i don't see how the UI events correlate to an issue though
[2014-05-30 06:01:02] cgoldberg: sounds more like a network or server issue
[2014-05-30 06:01:21] gnoze5: yep, but one I cant seem to replicate outside a browser
[2014-05-30 06:01:30] gnoze5: meaning,ive actually downloaded the file directly in tests
[2014-05-30 06:01:32] cgoldberg: why not just download the file a few thousand times and assert a checksum each time?
[2014-05-30 06:01:43] gnoze5: and it always comes in full
[2014-05-30 06:01:48] Dave_B_, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-05-30 06:03:34] cgoldberg: you should be able to do browser.execute_script() to return something
[2014-05-30 06:03:58] cgoldberg: gnoze5, ever used BMP (browsermob proxy)  sounds like it will behelpful here
[2014-05-30 06:04:02] cgoldberg: ?
[2014-05-30 06:04:09] gnoze5: never
[2014-05-30 06:04:12] cgoldberg: it's a recording proxy that works with webdriver
[2014-05-30 06:04:14] gnoze5: let me have a look
[2014-05-30 06:04:30] cgoldberg: you can see headers, file sizes, etc.. of all assetts that go across the network from your tests
[2014-05-30 06:05:36] cgoldberg: you could use BMP to record .har files of the network traffic.  and assert conditions on that (it's a json representation of the network traffic)

[2014-05-30 07:07:58] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-30 07:08:13] dimacus: yup
[2014-05-30 07:08:53] deanclkclk: I'm using the selenium-maven plugin
[2014-05-30 07:09:17] deanclkclk: and it is running a bunch of test cases..is there a way to tell it to kill a window?
[2014-05-30 07:09:27] dimacus: kill which window?
[2014-05-30 07:09:49] dimacus: IE?
[2014-05-30 07:11:14] deanclkclk: firefox
[2014-05-30 07:11:16] deanclkclk: sorry
[2014-05-30 07:11:39] deanclkclk: well here's the problem...I added pskill.exe to my windows/system32
[2014-05-30 07:11:48] deanclkclk: and from selenium we're trying to pskill
[2014-05-30 07:12:20] deanclkclk: the functional test are failing because, it's complaining it can't find the pskill.exe command
[2014-05-30 07:13:00] dimacus: is pskill in the path?
[2014-05-30 07:13:11] dimacus: maybe you should give full path to that exe
[2014-05-30 07:14:56] deanclkclk: even though I added it to the windows/system32 dimacus?
[2014-05-30 07:15:04] deanclkclk: does it needed to be added to the path/
[2014-05-30 07:15:05] deanclkclk: ?
[2014-05-30 07:15:24] deanclkclk: isn't everything under windows/system32 already added to the path by default?
[2014-05-30 07:15:33] dimacus: not sure
[2014-05-30 07:15:42] dimacus: not that good with windows $PATH :(
[2014-05-30 07:15:51] dimacus: deanclkclk: but i had a similar issue with IE and grid, not being able to clean up IE windows, so i started to work on this guy https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras
[2014-05-30 07:16:08] dimacus: basically it sets up a small server that you can send a kill_firefox or kill_ie or kill_chrome commands to

[2014-05-30 07:16:14] dimacus: don't know, might be overkill for you
[2014-05-30 07:16:30] deanclkclk: well I ran it in the command line and it work
[2014-05-30 07:16:39] deanclkclk: I ran pskill firefox and it works
[2014-05-30 07:16:47] deanclkclk: from the command line but, not the selenium test
[2014-05-30 07:17:26] dimacus: also, there is a chance that your java instance does not have full access to the system files
[2014-05-30 07:17:48] dimacus: you know being restricted and all, you might need to execute it as a stand alone shell command and not from within JVM
