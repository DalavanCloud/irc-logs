[2014-05-01 05:30:26] dude-x_: so the other day Boing Boing had an article about mysterious youtube videos, titled "Webdriver Torso" which had about 70,000 videos compiled
[2014-05-01 05:30:45] dude-x_: they thought it was mysterious because it was just different color boxes and a sine wave tone
[2014-05-01 05:31:13] dude-x_: and speculated that it was reminiscent of the CIA short wave radio stations that just reported numbers all day
[2014-05-01 05:31:54] dude-x_: then i spoiled the mystery by stating that it was really related to webdriver tests that some European company used and demonstrated at the GTAC'13 conference

[2014-05-01 06:41:50] Dave_B_: maybe it is finding the form initially before the page has reloaded, or maybe your form changes during page load? Sorry, not very helpful I realise

[2014-05-01 06:50:37] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-01 06:51:46] jimevans: i'd probably find the form, fill it out, execute the submit, then wait for the form element to become stale, then find it again.
[2014-05-01 06:55:21] joesmith: jimevans: so wait for the form itself to become stale before finding the "refreshed" one, instead of putting the find form and find inputs in a retry?

[2014-05-01 06:56:09] jimevans: after the submit, yes. because after the submit, you *know* the previously-used form element is going to become stale.
[2014-05-01 06:56:34] jimevans: there's even an ExpectedCondition for "stalenessOf" in the java bindings.

[2014-05-01 08:05:27] jmasseo: so i have to select the frame before i can interact with the elements on it

[2014-05-01 08:10:00] JamesPrescott: Yep, unfortunately
[2014-05-01 08:10:07] jmasseo: it's one of those things that looks like it's been around for quite a while
[2014-05-01 08:10:19] joesmith: update on my submit issue: if i find the submit button inside the form and click it, it works. so whatever submit() uses to find the submit button and click it is not working on this form
[2014-05-01 08:10:41] jmasseo: is the submit buttons type 'submit'?
[2014-05-01 08:10:54] jmasseo: i think there is some attr that is used for that
[2014-05-01 08:11:51] joesmith: jmasseo: yes it is, that's actually how i'm finding it within the form for the click alternative. but i did just find this: "submit() submits the form and executes the url that is given by the "action" attribute. If you have any javascript-function or jquery-plugin running to submit the form e.g. via ajax, submit() will ignore it. With click() the javascript-functions will be executed." http://stackoverflow.com/a/21238289/2149641
[2014-05-01 08:11:53] joesmith: that's the problem
[2014-05-01 08:12:16] jmasseo: right
[2014-05-01 08:12:17] joesmith: this form runs javascript onclick
[2014-05-01 08:12:50] jmasseo: writing this automation stuff for all these crusty EDI sites has been pretty educational.
[2014-05-01 08:12:54] jimevans: what the hell, IE10? seriously. what. the. hell.

[2014-05-01 08:19:45] jimevans: the IE10 ci build started breaking after a commit on 21 april.
[2014-05-01 08:19:49] nicholasdipiazza: Using chromedriver on Ubuntu 14 and i'm having sendKeys fail to send a few different keys. I'm connected through a VNC client. any ideas?
[2014-05-01 08:20:03] nicholasdipiazza: it will send 0, 1, and 2, but it won't send 6
[2014-05-01 08:20:41] Dave_B_: 9 day gap before that commit, wonder if something else got messed with
[2014-05-01 08:20:49] jmasseo: it's financial crap
[2014-05-01 08:20:52] jimevans: no, there were no commits during that time.
[2014-05-01 08:20:55] jmasseo: 'electronic data exchange'
[2014-05-01 08:21:00] jmasseo: like patient records and crap.
[2014-05-01 08:21:04] jmasseo: i don't look in the files
[2014-05-01 08:21:05] jmasseo: i just copy them

[2014-05-01 08:21:18] jmasseo: whatever
[2014-05-01 08:21:19] jmasseo: :)
[2014-05-01 08:21:39] jmasseo: basically i pull records from banks, insurance companys, and crap like that and copy them.
[2014-05-01 08:21:47] jmasseo: this is a task i picked up for the Computer Operators
[2014-05-01 08:21:55] jmasseo: since they would previously log in to these dozens of websites by hand and download the files.

[2014-05-01 08:22:42] jmasseo: i'd gotten a little gunshy about automating away parts of peoples workloads but this is a pretty good company i'm at.
[2014-05-01 08:22:57] jmasseo: also those guys were around before the web and i'm sure they'll find more work for them to do.
[2014-05-01 08:23:41] nicholasdipiazza: VNC problem
[2014-05-01 08:25:54] Dave_B_: jmasseo: Aye, it's always a touch sensitive if you can remove large chunks of work from someone - good in the long run but can make people more than slightly nervous
[2014-05-01 08:26:27] jimevans: okay.\
[2014-05-01 08:26:35] *jimevans rubs hands together'
[2014-05-01 08:26:40] jimevans: let's try firefox nightly
[2014-05-01 08:27:19] intchanter-work: If my most valuable job skill is doing some repetitive thing that can be done in 10 lines of code started by a cron job, I have bigger problems.
[2014-05-01 08:27:23] jmasseo: Dave_B_: when it works right though, it's my favorite kind of work.
[2014-05-01 08:27:33] jmasseo: A good sysadmin should be playing quake, because he's automated the rest of his tasks.
[2014-05-01 08:28:18] jmasseo: intchanter-work: they have probably hundreds of tasks they have to do.
[2014-05-01 08:28:21] jmasseo: they are the 'computer operators'
[2014-05-01 08:28:36] jmasseo: 'Operations'
[2014-05-01 08:28:54] jmasseo: i'd never actually worked at a place that had computer operators before.
[2014-05-01 08:29:05] jmasseo: the bank probably did, but i never saw them.
[2014-05-01 08:29:07] intchanter-work: I just mean that the prior existence of inefficiencies isn't reason to avoid eliminating inefficiencies.
[2014-05-01 08:29:14] jmasseo: intchanter-work: agreed.
[2014-05-01 08:29:22] jmasseo: all inefficiencies should be reduced or removed.
[2014-05-01 08:29:25] jmasseo: that does not mean firing people.
[2014-05-01 08:29:34] jmasseo: we employ an 80 year old guy who does like light facilities work.
[2014-05-01 08:29:42] jmasseo: i don't think the owner has ever done a layoff.
[2014-05-01 08:29:48] jmasseo: they just sort of find something else for you to do
[2014-05-01 08:30:02] intchanter-work: Right.  I have yet to hear of an actual situation where so much was automated so quickly that people lost their jobs as a result.
[2014-05-01 08:30:02] jmasseo: we'll see.  he's old and we've got 500 employees now.
[2014-05-01 08:30:17] jmasseo: i've heard of people losing their jobs due to automation.
[2014-05-01 08:30:28] jmasseo: but really only ancedotally.
[2014-05-01 08:30:36] intchanter-work: It's much more common for a company to be out-competed by another company that is leveraging technology.
[2014-05-01 08:30:53] jmasseo: right

[2014-05-01 08:32:03] Dave_B_: generally in a good way
[2014-05-01 08:32:27] Dave_B_: as repitition is basically bad in my eyes so any change to less repitition seems good, dunno if the people doing the work agree though
[2014-05-01 08:32:39] jmasseo: agreed
[2014-05-01 08:32:47] jmasseo: i'm all about doing certain tasks
[2014-05-01 08:32:52] jmasseo: but it has to be mentally involved
[2014-05-01 08:32:56] jmasseo: even if it is repetative
[2014-05-01 08:33:03] jmasseo: like filing something
[2014-05-01 08:33:16] jmasseo: (like a piece of metal, not putting files in a cabinet)
[2014-05-01 08:33:27] Dave_B_: haha I did wonder

[2014-05-01 08:46:25] pixelport: I am sorry for being so disrespectfull
[2014-05-01 08:46:31] pixelport: You are right
[2014-05-01 08:47:19] jimevans: as i outlined in the blog post, there is *literally* no response returned during the specified timeout from the remote end of the json wire protocol. you can increase the timeout, if you think the remote end is just taking awhile.

[2014-05-01 08:48:35] jimevans: otherwise, you'd need to either (1) provide a case that reproduces the issue (every. single. time.), or (2) debug into the remote end when it does happen and see if you can figure out why that http server hasn't sent a valid response.

[2014-05-01 09:35:49] dude-x: i have firefox 29 and python selenium, what do i need to run marionette, just the marionnete lib
[2014-05-01 09:36:53] jimevans: dude-x: no idea. marionette isn't integrated into the core webdriver bindings yet.
[2014-05-01 09:37:26] ato: dude-x: You can use the marionette_client library in Python, which is WebDriver-like.

[2014-05-01 09:41:41] jimevans: it also doesn't reset the currently-focused frame to the top-level frame on navigation.

[2014-05-01 09:55:23] lukeis: jimevans: looks to be a winning combination so far ;)
[2014-05-01 09:55:29] pixelport: It almost ever works after the first exception. The second try mostly works.
[2014-05-01 09:56:40] jimevans: pixelport: can't be guaranteed though. and you're just doing a blind retry. it's possible you could end up with unexpected results.
[2014-05-01 09:56:47] lukeis: kicked off this one too http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/view/IE%20Tests/job/IE%2011%20Win7%20Javascript%20Tests/
[2014-05-01 09:57:20] pixelport: what could I do better?
[2014-05-01 09:57:35] pixelport: beside of fixing the real problem
[2014-05-01 09:57:45] jimevans: have you tried expanding the timeout?
[2014-05-01 09:57:59] jimevans: are you sure that the request just isn't taking longer than expected?
[2014-05-01 09:58:00] pixelport: its already 60 seconds
[2014-05-01 09:58:09] lukeis: and what happens if the server is still actually processing something?
[2014-05-01 09:58:19] jimevans: lukeis: bingo!
[2014-05-01 09:58:27] lukeis: ;)
[2014-05-01 09:58:29] pixelport: this shoud not take 60s

[2014-05-01 09:59:04] jimevans: pixelport: but you don't *know* that for certain. you don't know *what* the remote end is doing. you've done no investigation there (that you've mentioned)
[2014-05-01 09:59:16] *lukeis loves 'should' in troubleshooting...'
[2014-05-01 09:59:51] pixelport: yes at least i am throwing the exception after 3 tryes
[2014-05-01 10:00:06] pixelport: so I would be informed anyway
[2014-05-01 10:00:22] jimevans: you're just assuming that a blind retry from the .net bindings is the answer. you haven't given any indication whether the problem happens on all browsers, or just one.
[2014-05-01 10:00:28] lukeis: we have that in selendroidâ€¦ i've yet to see the retry actually recover on a second attempt :(
[2014-05-01 10:01:06] pixelport: It seems to me that the problem is reproducable if you open many webdriver firefox windows

[2014-05-01 10:03:25] jimevans: always, always, *always* call the .quit method
[2014-05-01 10:03:54] jimevans: (and don't tell me it's impossible. you and i both know that's inaccurate)
[2014-05-01 10:04:07] pixelport: but the problem happens often enaugh even with just one webdriver firefox window

[2014-05-01 10:04:52] lukeis: (not to mention fill up in temporary disk space from the firefox profiles!)
[2014-05-01 10:04:53] jimevans: okay, so now we're back to the original question. "what on the remote end (the firefox extension that webdriver uses) is causing the request to not return?"
[2014-05-01 10:05:11] pixelport: hmm
[2014-05-01 10:06:08] jimevans: blindly retrying from the local end (the .net bindings) is *not* the solution. i will defend that assertion until i'm blue in the face, and i will fight adding such a hack workaround to the actual bindings until they pry my commit bit from my cold, dead fingers.
[2014-05-01 10:07:39] jimevans: until you can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that either the request never made it to the remote end (the firefox extension) or that the remote end simply didn't return the proper response, you're playing with fire by blindly retrying.,
[2014-05-01 10:07:40] pixelport: yes you are absolutly right. My workaround is not a solution at all.
[2014-05-01 10:10:38] pixelport: can there really go so much wrong with blindly retrying? What bad could happen?
[2014-05-01 10:12:01] pixelport: Maybe a click could be done twice.
[2014-05-01 10:12:19] jimevans: consider a click that does not return. if the remote call is actually just processing, you could get two clicks registered, which could be bad. or it could attempt to click on an element that doesn't exist, anymore because the first click finally got processed.
[2014-05-01 10:12:40] jimevans: either of which could generate false positive failures.
[2014-05-01 10:12:58] pixelport: thats not acceptable
[2014-05-01 10:13:17] jimevans: and now you're right back where you started from, except you're actually worse off, because you really don't know what the root cause was.
[2014-05-01 10:13:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 815
[2014-05-01 10:14:15] jimevans: you don't know if it was that an extra click was processed, or that the second click was superfluous. the hard failure on the first click gives you an explicit notice that the failure happened in a specific place.
[2014-05-01 10:15:22] jimevans: you could code a re-click into your wrapper logic, which would give you a snowball's chance of recognizing that you ran into a problem (because you could log it yourself).

[2014-05-01 11:24:03] jleyba: jimevans: IE11 should still leave traces of it being IE in the user agent

[2014-05-01 11:31:27] joesmith: dude-x: i suppose i could do that. i guess i figured there was some way i was missing since the enter key still works inside both so the browser must know how to submit
[2014-05-01 11:32:23] dude-x: it's most likely the submit button is not an <input submit> type, but a fancy div/span element that has a javascript click handler to do an XHR request
[2014-05-01 11:33:21] jimevans: ugh.
[2014-05-01 11:33:39] jimevans: now i have to dig into the atoms to figure out why contentEditable elements aren't visible in IE11
[2014-05-01 11:34:20] joesmith: dude-x: it's actually just a regular button - http://bpaste.net/show/E0L6jSl5ehkQxeSbQYUU/
[2014-05-01 11:34:32] joesmith: it has a onclick listener
[2014-05-01 11:34:56] dude-x: so find the button and just use .click()

[2014-05-01 11:36:59] dude-x: do you use the page object model?
[2014-05-01 11:38:04] jleyba: jimevans: it's probably a rogue if (goog.userAgent.IE) statement
