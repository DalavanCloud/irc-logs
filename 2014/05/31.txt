[2014-05-31 22:36:01] regedit: running selenium from eclipse, seems to spawn a new instance of FireFox that does not remember my usual FF settings
[2014-05-31 22:50:17] nVitius: regedit: correct. the ff profile selenium uses is a clean one
[2014-05-31 22:50:31] nVitius: not sure if you could make it use yours though
[2014-05-31 22:51:41] nVitius: take a look at this page: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/TipsAndTricks
[2014-05-31 22:51:49] nVitius: might be what you're looking for

[2014-05-31 23:12:21] regedit: nVitius: thanks, the folks at irc.mozilla.org #firefox told me selenium spawns its own FF profile, and directed me how to make it re-use my usual FF profile
[2014-05-31 23:15:10] regedit: if anyone else around; how much can I get done at once with a simple selenium webdriver; can I get work done in multiple tabs? multiple windows? other?
