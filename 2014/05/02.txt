[2014-05-02 15:48:56] simonstewart: The UNIX “ln” command and the Files.createSymbolicLink API in Java swap the order of their parameters
[2014-05-02 15:49:19] jimevans: sure they do. because why not?
[2014-05-02 15:49:37] p_l: For the glory of Satan?
[2014-05-02 15:49:38] jleyba: because oracle
[2014-05-02 15:49:44] simonstewart: Reminds me of a system I worked on that swapped the order of two parameters each time it went trhough a loop
[2014-05-02 15:49:59] simonstewart: If the loop was performed an even number of times, everuthing was fine
[2014-05-02 15:50:12] simonstewart: An odd number, and the wrong value ended up on the wrong part of the screen
[2014-05-02 15:50:31] p_l: jleyba: I think it's older than Oracle
[2014-05-02 15:50:34] simonstewart: It was at that moment that I truely grew to detest Stringly typed-code
[2014-05-02 15:50:37] jimevans: jleyba: something tells me that behaviour probably predates oracle's ownership.
[2014-05-02 15:50:56] jleyba: java.nio.file.Files is java 7
[2014-05-02 15:50:59] simonstewart: Paths and Files were introduced in Java 7
[2014-05-02 15:51:11] jimevans: oh well never mind then.
[2014-05-02 15:51:26] jimevans: the lesson, as always...
[2014-05-02 15:51:43] jleyba: Another fun java fact: you cannot disable automatic updates on windows

[2014-05-02 15:55:59] jimevans: two, if so, what's the magic target to run them with crazy-fun?
[2014-05-02 15:56:07] simonstewart: Oh. This is buck
[2014-05-02 15:56:39] jimevans: i have an os-specific IE bug with RC.
[2014-05-02 15:56:49] simonstewart: Is that OS “Windows"?
[2014-05-02 15:56:50] jimevans: don't ask why
[2014-05-02 15:57:12] jimevans: not just "windows" but specifically windows 8.

[2014-05-02 15:59:44] simonstewart: git commit -a -m ‘Too hard to handle’
[2014-05-02 15:59:45] jimevans: IE just plain doesn't launch in windows 8

[2014-05-02 15:59:57] jimevans: under RC
[2014-05-02 16:00:13] jimevans: webdriver is fine

[2014-05-02 16:01:05] jimevans: launching with *iexploreproxy is what does it.

[2014-05-02 16:01:55] jimevans: well, RC tries to write to the registry, and fails miserably, for one.
[2014-05-02 16:02:09] jimevans: tries to create hklm\software\javasoft\prefs
[2014-05-02 16:02:39] jleyba: probably https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/browserlaunchers/WindowsProxyManager.java

[2014-05-02 16:06:01] jimevans: consider it mentioned

[2014-05-02 16:10:32] lukeis: our team passive aggressively deals with it… any new bug we get we say "Switch to WebDriver" then deprioritize it and let it bit rot
[2014-05-02 16:11:02] jimevans: well, and there is an active refactoring effort happening too.
[2014-05-02 16:11:16] lukeis: semi-active
[2014-05-02 16:11:19] jimevans: which would make things easier to untangle at least.

[2014-05-02 16:11:28] jleyba: do you have a common framework everyone uses to write tests?
[2014-05-02 16:11:39] lukeis: yes
[2014-05-02 16:11:40] jimevans: for the most part.

[2014-05-02 16:12:08] jleyba: Yeah, we don't have anything like that
[2014-05-02 16:12:17] lukeis: and they all extend a horrible class called SeleniumTest… that basically looks like DefaultSelenium
[2014-05-02 16:12:31] jleyba: Please tell me that's at least junit3 and not testng
