[2014-05-15 07:54:26] WhereIsMySpoon: ...a good programmer?
[2014-05-15 07:54:32] AutomatedTester: change "someIframeId" to input.findElement(By.id("someIframeId")) in the switch to and see what error you get
[2014-05-15 07:54:46] AutomatedTester: plushwork: a programmer that writes tests is called a programmer
[2014-05-15 07:54:49] WhereIsMySpoon: all good programmers should write tests for their code

[2014-05-15 07:56:12] WhereIsMySpoon: OscarRieken: aye
[2014-05-15 07:56:35] plushwork: AutomatedTester: right now it's java. But they refused to name me a java dev. And "qa specialist" doesn't really discern me from those that do manual tests
[2014-05-15 07:56:52] sircapsalot: same here plushwork.  "Software Test Analyst" for me
[2014-05-15 07:56:58] sircapsalot: though i do nothing manual
[2014-05-15 07:57:02] AutomatedTester: plushwork: if you are writing java code you ar ea java developer
[2014-05-15 07:57:15] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: so I changed my apply method to this: public WebElement apply(WebDriver input) { 					return input.findElement(By.id("iframe")); 				}
[2014-05-15 07:57:19] AutomatedTester: plushwork: if they dont want to do that then I suggest finding work elsewhere
[2014-05-15 07:57:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and it runs fine
[2014-05-15 07:58:15] AutomatedTester: plushwork: automation requires programming skills, they should pay accordingly and have the right job title (job titles are mostly meaningless anyway)
[2014-05-15 07:58:37] sircapsalot: a title is a title.. if you are doing automation, but your title is something that doesn't discern you, as long as you are getting the right pay grade, who cares.   titles don't matter
[2014-05-15 07:58:58] AutomatedTester: you could go for Software Developer in Test
[2014-05-15 07:59:08] sircapsalot: that's a good one.
[2014-05-15 07:59:13] AutomatedTester: or Software Engineer in Test
[2014-05-15 07:59:14] sircapsalot: Test Automation Engineer
[2014-05-15 07:59:26] AutomatedTester: SETs at Google help write automation
[2014-05-15 07:59:29] sircapsalot: Software Test Engineer,, etc
[2014-05-15 07:59:35] AutomatedTester: but they are developers
[2014-05-15 07:59:38] plushwork: AutomatedTester: unless you find a good job offer that says "Experience in similar position". If you're a lead java developer and your job desc says you're junior windows admin noone will invite you over to see your skills

[2014-05-15 08:00:15] AutomatedTester: plushwork: right, but if you are writing java selenium code you are a java developer
[2014-05-15 08:00:50] AutomatedTester: last time I checked, both selenium code and normal production code still has to be compiled via javac
[2014-05-15 08:01:31] OscarRieken: AutomatedTester - I don't know about that I have seen some hacked together code that "worked" and those people called themselves developers
[2014-05-15 08:01:47] plushwork: But being a junior java developer in a company that doesn't have any other java devs is icky

[2014-05-15 08:02:06] WhereIsMySpoon: so write your tests in a different language
[2014-05-15 08:02:07] sircapsalot: OscarRieken  it's even worse when they have the "Senior" tag...........
[2014-05-15 08:02:14] AutomatedTester: OscarRieken: and thats why Automation people MUST be considered programmers too
[2014-05-15 08:02:16] cgoldberg: OscarRieken, anyone that develops code can call themselves that.. even if what they deliver is crap :)
[2014-05-15 08:02:18] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: what language is everyone else using
[2014-05-15 08:02:22] plushwork: hmm...Automation developer. Sounds good. Does it sound like someone who records macros with his mouse?
[2014-05-15 08:02:25] plushwork: WhereIsMySpoon: php
[2014-05-15 08:02:34] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess selenium doesnt have bin ds for php
[2014-05-15 08:02:41] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: no it doesnt :S
[2014-05-15 08:02:53] WhereIsMySpoon: [16:02] <plushwork> hmm...Automation developer. Sounds good. Does it sound like someone who records macros with his mouse? <--- no

[2014-05-15 08:03:35] WhereIsMySpoon: if php does have binds why not use those
[2014-05-15 08:03:43] cgoldberg: plushwork, don't sweat the title.. the macro recording people will be quickly screened out.. you are not competing with them
[2014-05-15 08:03:44] sircapsalot: because it's php
[2014-05-15 08:03:48] sircapsalot: i mean...

[2014-05-15 08:05:18] plushwork: I won't go into the details how the choices were made. But if I understand correctly the QA team was told by some specialist that they should write tests in IntelliJ
[2014-05-15 08:05:25] cgoldberg: plushwork, your writing tests in java for a php codebase with devs that don't know java?  sounds like recipe for disaster to me
[2014-05-15 08:05:44] WhereIsMySpoon: wtf does the ide have to do with selenium

[2014-05-15 08:05:58] AutomatedTester: plushwork: sounds like some consultant took your company for a ride
[2014-05-15 08:06:05] WhereIsMySpoon: intellij is a fine ide
[2014-05-15 08:06:11] WhereIsMySpoon: it just has nothing to do with selenium
[2014-05-15 08:06:13] sircapsalot: yes… yes it is
[2014-05-15 08:06:17] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: it is just not in a php shop
[2014-05-15 08:06:21] sircapsalot: so worth the money for the personal license
[2014-05-15 08:06:28] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: sure
[2014-05-15 08:06:30] WhereIsMySpoon: I meant for java

[2014-05-15 08:07:02] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: yup, some things are worth the money :)
[2014-05-15 08:07:03] plushwork: well php codebase has nothing to do with that. It's functional testing so I don't care if they have written that in php or befunge
[2014-05-15 08:07:07] OscarRieken: So I have to hire testers, So I built a small web page that i send to candidates, I ask them to test the 2 stories, the site has 13 actual defects in it :) if they submit code any kind they come in for face to face with 1 hour of pairing
[2014-05-15 08:07:14] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, i've yet to find one though :)
[2014-05-15 08:07:28] OscarRieken: I did the same thing at Thoughtworks but it never really took off
[2014-05-15 08:07:43] WhereIsMySpoon: OscarRieken: of any kind at all? :p
[2014-05-15 08:07:43] sircapsalot: plushwork: though you'll want to match the same software as the apps you write them for typically since the developers will be able to fix their mistakes on the automated tests if need be
[2014-05-15 08:07:50] OscarRieken: yeah
[2014-05-15 08:07:55] WhereIsMySpoon: even if totally unrelated?
[2014-05-15 08:08:04] OscarRieken: :p for the site

[2014-05-15 08:08:43] plushwork: sircapsalot: well, yeah, having a technology more developers understand and use would be good for company. But having technology only I will learn to use will be good for me.
[2014-05-15 08:08:57] OscarRieken: also the Jetbrains stuff always goes on sale for 1/2 price on black friday and xmas
[2014-05-15 08:08:57] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: I dont think you understand
[2014-05-15 08:09:06] OscarRieken: ccp?
[2014-05-15 08:09:16] WhereIsMySpoon: someone recommending you use java because you should use intellij for automated tests is braindead

[2014-05-15 08:09:38] OscarRieken: ah yeah
[2014-05-15 08:09:39] plushwork: WhereIsMySpoon: that' not my fault! When I pushed for automated tests I wanted CasperJS

[2014-05-15 08:10:06] cgoldberg: plushwork, learning java in a vacuum isn't a great career decision
[2014-05-15 08:10:26] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: tell them you'll be able to push out better tests, faster if you do it your way
[2014-05-15 08:10:35] WhereIsMySpoon: and that it will be more time and money if they want it their way
[2014-05-15 08:10:38] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-15 08:10:44] WhereIsMySpoon: and that also you will be less happy if their wa

[2014-05-15 08:11:26] WhereIsMySpoon: In any case
[2014-05-15 08:11:28] cgoldberg: WhereIsMySpoon, plushwork.. or explain that the devs certainly can't maintain, debug, create, or fix any test code... and that alone will make this test effort fail
[2014-05-15 08:11:47] WhereIsMySpoon: Test Automation Engineer is a good name for what you're doing
[2014-05-15 08:11:49] plushwork: cgoldberg: yeah, I'm kinda afraid of that vacuum thing. I mean, I started working full-time instead of freelancing so I would have other people around me
[2014-05-15 08:12:07] cgoldberg: plushwork, right.. collaboration is awesome
[2014-05-15 08:12:10] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: then say that
[2014-05-15 08:12:19] OscarRieken: If i get to pick the lang to write tests ill do it in ruby (they have the coolest testing tools imo), but here we have automation in ruby, java, c#, js, and go
[2014-05-15 08:12:32] WhereIsMySpoon: <3 ruby
[2014-05-15 08:12:41] WhereIsMySpoon: rails is awesomez

[2014-05-15 08:14:51] plushwork: How about js errors? Possible without injecting code?
[2014-05-15 08:15:15] sircapsalot: what do yo umean listeners?    just navigate to the page, then validate that the text 404 appears on the page, or something more unique than that, then force navigation elsewhere
[2014-05-15 08:15:36] sircapsalot: js errors is past me… i've never validated that js errors exist :|
[2014-05-15 08:16:53] plushwork: sircapsalot: that won't work if the css file fails to load. Unless I scrape the source and dom for all objects and check them seperetaly
[2014-05-15 08:17:40] plushwork: I mean. In CasperJS I have a simple script that's a few dozen lines long and crawls thru all site looking for anything that's dead

[2014-05-15 12:46:07] AutomatedTester: sircapsalot: when Jason was thinking of a name he looked at what competing products there were out there, and there werent any, but the main one that people were using was winrunner
[2014-05-15 12:46:17] jop008: I don't give in a path only a name
[2014-05-15 12:46:26] AutomatedTester: and winrunner was created by a company called Mercury (since bought by HP)

[2014-05-15 14:54:54] AutomatedTester: the main issue is we will need to discuss when do we check the value of capabilities
[2014-05-15 14:55:15] AutomatedTester: since we can populate the values at the beginning of a session and then use it
[2014-05-15 14:55:34] AutomatedTester: we may now need to check the value on each call

[2014-05-15 14:56:06] barancev: how to pass them on each call?
[2014-05-15 14:57:04] AutomatedTester: so I set the pageLoadingStrategy to be X for example, then using a potential new API change it to Y
[2014-05-15 14:57:45] AutomatedTester: anything that can invoke a page load will need to check the value of the capability before working
[2014-05-15 14:58:28] barancev: ah, I see
[2014-05-15 14:59:14] barancev: I vote for "check all the time"
[2014-05-15 14:59:32] AutomatedTester: but that has a cost to browser speed
[2014-05-15 14:59:56] barancev: checking capability value? are you joking?
[2014-05-15 15:00:26] jimevans: not to mention that capabilities are arbitrary. you could have any number of them.
[2014-05-15 15:00:59] AutomatedTester: for page loads for example you will need to check at least 2 capabilities
[2014-05-15 15:01:06] DDR_new, quitting. (Quit:)
[2014-05-15 15:01:09] AutomatedTester: timeout and the strategy
[2014-05-15 15:01:42] AutomatedTester: timeout isnt really one
[2014-05-15 15:02:02] barancev: checking is fast, or do I misunderstand something?
[2014-05-15 15:02:23] AutomatedTester: it might be fast for 1 call
[2014-05-15 15:02:48] AutomatedTester: its an arbitary amount of extra running when it can be cached on startup

[2014-05-15 15:04:01] barancev: checking a capability value is just "get capability value" plus a single "if"/"switch" operation, no?
[2014-05-15 15:04:38] barancev: I don't get what is slow here
[2014-05-15 15:04:47] AutomatedTester: in Firefox it will need to be pushed to disk
[2014-05-15 15:05:21] barancev: it is implementation specific
[2014-05-15 15:05:36] barancev: we don't have to use preferences to store capabilities
[2014-05-15 15:05:49] AutomatedTester: we dont need to make them mutable either

[2014-05-15 15:07:35] jimevans: agreed on "native events". with marionette, IE is the only one it applies to
[2014-05-15 15:07:42] barancev: you forget people want support for older versions too
[2014-05-15 15:07:49] lukeis: it applies for selendroid and ios-driver too
[2014-05-15 15:08:05] AutomatedTester: lukeis: what for firefox?
