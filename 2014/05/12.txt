[2014-05-12 02:34:24] Voyage: ato,  ok. how to set it?
[2014-05-12 02:34:37] ato: DISPLAY=:99 /usr/bin/firefox
[2014-05-12 02:34:42] Voyage: hm
[2014-05-12 02:35:03] ato: FWIW a more reliable approach is to use a Xvfb wrapper, such as xvfb-run.
[2014-05-12 02:35:28] ato: I say more reliable, but what I mean is that it makes the framebuffer session easier to control.
[2014-05-12 02:35:47] Voyage: ato,  $ DISPLAY=:99 /usr/bin/firefox
[2014-05-12 02:35:47] Voyage: Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":99".
[2014-05-12 02:35:55] ato: For example, replace your Firefox binary with "/usr/bin/xvfb-run /usr/bin/firefox".
[2014-05-12 02:36:15] ato: Voyage: I think that's just a warning?
[2014-05-12 02:36:44] Voyage: $ firefox
[2014-05-12 02:36:44] Voyage: Error: no display specified
[2014-05-12 02:36:45] teorias, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-12 02:37:08] ato: You need to prefix DISPLAY=:99.
[2014-05-12 02:37:18] ato: Or export it to your shell, like export DISPLAY=:99.
[2014-05-12 02:37:27] Voyage: hm
[2014-05-12 02:37:38] Voyage: I have already exported it
[2014-05-12 02:37:49] ato: What does `echo $DISPLAY` say?
[2014-05-12 02:38:04] Voyage: oh ok. now $ firefox
[2014-05-12 02:38:04] Voyage: Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":99".
[2014-05-12 02:38:31] ato: IIRC that shouldn't be fatal.
[2014-05-12 02:38:37] Voyage: HM OK
[2014-05-12 02:39:08] ato: If the process doesn't end immediately, you have your Firefox running in Xvfb.
[2014-05-12 02:39:10] Voyage: if I have set the export ok. I am ok to run the java code?
[2014-05-12 02:39:35] ato: Well you can't connect to an already running Firefox instance with Selenium.
[2014-05-12 02:40:01] Voyage: ok
[2014-05-12 02:40:02] ato: So you need to set up the framebuffer and the new Firefox instance from your Java code.
[2014-05-12 02:40:15] Voyage: I would ctrl^c
[2014-05-12 02:40:27] ato: Which is why I said it would likely be easier for you to replace the Firefox binary location with a custom one: "xvfb-run firefox".
[2014-05-12 02:40:46] ato: If you're running Debian, you could `sudo aptitude install xvfb-run`.
[2014-05-12 02:40:47] Voyage: now with java code, I am getting org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Failed to connect to binary FirefoxBinary(/usr/bin/firefox) on port 7055; process output follows:
[2014-05-12 02:40:48] Voyage: Error: no display specified
[2014-05-12 02:41:10] ato: Right.  It doesn't know which X display to put Firefox on.
[2014-05-12 02:41:32] ato: Try to replace /usr/bin/firefox with "xvfb-run /usr/bin/firefox".
[2014-05-12 02:42:20] Voyage: ato,  but that is not in my javacode
[2014-05-12 02:42:32] Voyage: i mean, I cant do xvfb-run /usr/bin/firefox    in java code
[2014-05-12 02:42:38] ato: Why not?
[2014-05-12 02:42:40] Voyage: for running firefox. it went well
[2014-05-12 02:43:01] Voyage: ato,  in java code. its something like. driver =  new Firefoxdriver..()
[2014-05-12 02:43:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 819
[2014-05-12 02:43:39] ato: The typical way is to provide the FirefoxDriver object with a set of capabilities, in which you can usually specify the browser's binary location.
[2014-05-12 02:44:59] Voyage: hm
[2014-05-12 02:45:03] Voyage: by the way E: Unable to locate package xvfb-run

[2014-05-12 02:45:45] ato: Or you can use the webdriver.firefox.bin system variable.
[2014-05-12 02:45:49] ato: (For Java.)
[2014-05-12 02:46:01] ato: You probably need to install it then?

[2014-05-12 02:51:28] barancev: set it for the console where you run the tests :)
[2014-05-12 02:51:55] Voyage: barancev,  actaully, that console is "i dont know" as its a java ee app.
[2014-05-12 02:52:00] Voyage: using servlets
[2014-05-12 02:52:26] barancev: the tests, not the app under testing!
[2014-05-12 02:52:55] Voyage: the tomcat server is runing as servidce. the test is ran by that server server call
[2014-05-12 02:53:14] Voyage: I need a var for all consoles
[2014-05-12 02:53:15] barancev: ok, set it in the console you run tomcat from
[2014-05-12 02:53:17] Voyage: possible?
[2014-05-12 02:53:27] Voyage: barancev,  tomcate is ran by system
[2014-05-12 02:53:40] barancev: one can't change env vars for already running processes
[2014-05-12 02:53:53] Voyage: I will reboot
[2014-05-12 02:54:13] Voyage: or stop proces. set var. run again
[2014-05-12 02:54:22] barancev: so set the vars in the script that starts tomcat

[2014-05-12 02:57:01] Voyage: barancev,  you have linux ?
[2014-05-12 02:57:09] barancev: sure
[2014-05-12 02:57:09] Voyage: do cat /etc/environment
[2014-05-12 02:58:47] barancev: and?
[2014-05-12 02:59:11] Voyage: barancev,  making and entry in this file of      DISPLAY=;99 would make an env var for all consoles
[2014-05-12 02:59:13] Voyage: no?
[2014-05-12 03:01:08] barancev: a file under /etc/profile.d/ would be a better place
[2014-05-12 03:01:19] barancev: or even the profile of a specific user

[2014-05-12 07:43:16] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: why would the alert test for dismiss call dismiss... that sounds like a silly idea

[2014-05-12 07:43:38] simonstewart: Because with an alert, accept and dismiss are synonyms

[2014-05-12 07:58:07] simonstewart: I’m kind of swamped
[2014-05-12 07:58:31] teorias: well, I can say that I already listen something about the deprecated RC
[2014-05-12 07:58:46] jimevans: simonstewart: sorry, i assumed that the 'wtf' comment was in response to "how can people be unaware about deprecation of rc" my bad. i'll quit bothering now. :)
[2014-05-12 07:58:59] simonstewart: No. That was what the WTF was in response to
[2014-05-12 07:59:09] teorias: but when I came to this channel 1 month ago and talked about my idea..
[2014-05-12 07:59:46] teorias: I got the idea that the best way  to implement a gracefully shutdown was on the RC..

[2014-05-12 08:01:04] jimevans: teorias: i'd suspect the "right" way to do it would be to add a new endpoint and http servlet to the java code that implements the shutdown code for the server.
[2014-05-12 08:01:11] teorias: ok
[2014-05-12 08:01:14] teorias: thanks

[2014-05-12 12:58:52] jimevans: also, how many is "a bunch"?
[2014-05-12 12:59:26] jimevans: and is this the first test case to run on the machine after a reboot, or are there other test cases that have run before?
[2014-05-12 12:59:30] jleyba: jimevans: nope. 32-bit windows

[2014-05-12 13:00:23] jimevans: here's a couple of dirty little secrets about IE10+
[2014-05-12 13:00:33] dawagner: That sounds juicy
[2014-05-12 13:01:16] jimevans: first, when you launch IE the first time, you get two iexplore.exe processes. one is an actual browser window process, the other is a broker process.
[2014-05-12 13:01:30] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!
[2014-05-12 13:01:31] seljenkinsbot: Project Build All Java build #4783: FIXED in 10 min: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Build%20All%20Java/4783/
[2014-05-12 13:01:44] jimevans: so even when you have only one browser window, with a single tab open, you'll still have two iexplore.exe processes in the list.

[2014-05-12 13:02:31] rebelagentm, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2014-05-12 13:02:40] jimevans: another little secret is that when you call driver.quit(), all of the iexplore.exe processes associated with that session don't immediately exit.
[2014-05-12 13:02:53] jimevans: one will hang around for a bit, up to about 15 seconds.
[2014-05-12 13:03:06] jimevans: normally, from the IE driver's perspective, this isn't an issue.
[2014-05-12 13:03:10] bluescreen10, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-05-12 13:03:26] jimevans: we just launch another (which gives you another two iexplore.exe processes), and we're fine.
[2014-05-12 13:03:41] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-12 13:03:49] jimevans: where we run into issues is in the "link click opens a new browser context" scenario.
[2014-05-12 13:04:05] p0deje, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-05-12 13:04:44] jimevans: that's specifically the case where we have to wait for the orphaned iexplore.exe manager process to shut down before we can successfully call cocreateinstance on the new IE instance we have to create to represent the new top-level browsing context (a.k.a., the "popup browser window")
[2014-05-12 13:05:14] jimevans: IE tries to be a little to clever in its COM object management.
[2014-05-12 13:06:22] jimevans: anyway, in the case where you have a test case that ends, calls driver.quit(), then launches another browser, i'd expect you to have no less than three iexplore.exe processes in the task list, at least at the start of the second test.
[2014-05-12 13:07:09] jimevans: you have the two iexplore.exe processes (one manager process/one renderer process) for the newly instantiated driver instance, and the one leftover iexplore.exe process from the previous test case where the COM server hasn't completely shut itself down yet.

[2014-05-12 13:10:09] jimevans: after you call driver.quit(), if you watch the process list, one of the iexplore.exe processes will eventually exit out. :)
