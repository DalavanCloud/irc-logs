[2014-05-05 05:57:27] Voyage: in java
[2014-05-05 05:58:44] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-05 05:58:54] jimevans: Voyage: define "loaded".
[2014-05-05 05:59:16] jimevans: in my experience, the term is meaningless in today's javascript-driven, ajax-heavy web.
[2014-05-05 05:59:23] Voyage: jimevans,  all the html and javascript includes are loaded.
[2014-05-05 05:59:48] rorycb, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-05-05 06:00:02] jimevans: that's still no guarantee that the javascript has completed execution, so the term "loaded" is still meaningless in that context.
[2014-05-05 06:00:20] jimevans: because what about setTimeout()?
[2014-05-05 06:00:22] Voyage: jimevans,  some how not loading dom if i click the js link . http://pastie.org/9142363     http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/?device=iphone
[2014-05-05 06:01:12] jimevans: how are you determining that the DOM isn't loaded?
[2014-05-05 06:02:24] Voyage: I see the browser is still loading sign
[2014-05-05 06:02:42] Voyage: jimevans,  and most importantly, why I cant click it programatically. it does not loads
[2014-05-05 06:02:50] *jimevans is trying to lead Voyage down the path to waiting for whatever thing on the *next* page, not blindly assuming one can magically tell that the page is loaded'
[2014-05-05 06:02:54] Voyage: jimevans,  and most importantly, why I cant click it programatically. it does not loads the dom elements (as it should on click)
[2014-05-05 06:03:32] Voyage: jimevans, ignoring timouts and partial loads. what is the best strategy to be sure that the full page is loaded?
[2014-05-05 06:03:47] jimevans: you can't. don't try.
[2014-05-05 06:04:14] jimevans: figure out something on the next page you expect to interact with, and wait for that to appear.
[2014-05-05 06:04:31] jimevans: by "next page", i mean the page that loads *after* the click
[2014-05-05 06:05:16] jimevans: if the question you're asking is "when can i tell that the page is loaded", You're Doing It Wrong™
[2014-05-05 06:07:46] Voyage: jimevans,  the "load all"  JS link on the bottom of  http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/?device=iphone loads some data in the DOM in the SAME page. How can I click and get that html?\

[2014-05-05 06:17:18] Voyage: jimevans,  ok. I just tried to wait for 10seconds. it worked. for testing....but after the DOM was loaded and I did link.click();   driver.getPageSource();. The source that I got, didnt had the dom element html that was created because of the link click
[2014-05-05 06:19:33] jimevans: getPageSource is probably the absolute worst way you could attempt to determine presence/absence of a given element on a page.
[2014-05-05 06:19:53] Voyage: jimevans,  ya, so how to do that?
[2014-05-05 06:20:23] jimevans: use findElement.
[2014-05-05 06:20:28] jimevans: or findElements
[2014-05-05 06:20:41] jimevans: in the singular case, catch the NoSuchElementException
[2014-05-05 06:21:02] jimevans: in the plural case, check the .size() of the resulting list. (> 0 means the element exists)
[2014-05-05 06:23:18] Voyage: if i used findElement and the element had not been loaded yet. it will say "didnt found that element" and die
[2014-05-05 06:23:32] Voyage: thats not what I want. I want to wait until its loaded
[2014-05-05 06:23:52] jimevans: use the WebDriverWait construct for exactly that purpose.

[2014-05-05 11:39:21] santiycr: But O'Connor did find a company called Selenium that makes a product called Selenium Ice, which has a function called … WebDriver. The software is used to automate testing websites, but even its creators don't know what the videos are about.
[2014-05-05 11:39:26] santiycr: It looked likely that "Webdriver Torso" was part of this project, not only because of the shared neologism but also because automation seemed like the only plausible explanation for uploading this quantity of video. But Patrick Lightbody, who has been involved with Selenium since 2005, denied that there was any connection between their WebDriver and Webdriver Torso.
