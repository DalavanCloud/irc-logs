[2014-05-18 06:47:01] smccarthy: crocket: JUnit or TestNG if using java. Is that what you are looking for ?
[2014-05-18 06:47:13] crocket: smccarthy, no java.
[2014-05-18 06:47:24] crocket: I'm looking for javascript, python, or ruby.
[2014-05-18 06:47:44] crocket: So far, I found yadda and mocha that can drive webdriver.js
[2014-05-18 06:48:05] crocket: Java is too verbose for my eyes.
[2014-05-18 06:53:30] FMJaggy: in node i use selenium-webdriver npm package

[2014-05-18 07:01:59] crocket: FMJaggy, What about webdriver.js?
[2014-05-18 07:05:35] FMJaggy: idk about it, i know i don't need to start the server seperately (if i want to use chromedriver), other than that seems pretty similar
[2014-05-18 07:06:43] FMJaggy: different api though, i find that nodejs libs change rapidly, so i like that in sel-wd most of the examples used for java/ruby seem to work in js
[2014-05-18 07:06:48] crocket: https://www.npmjs.org/package/webdriverjs
[2014-05-18 07:07:13] crocket: FMJaggy, Which language do you prefer for selenium testing?
[2014-05-18 07:07:42] FMJaggy: it looks like this lib would require a seperate example for every existing selenium example
[2014-05-18 07:10:20] OscarRieken, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-05-18 07:11:49] FMJaggy: crocket: doesn't matter to me, but I'd rather not learn a new api for each language
[2014-05-18 07:12:52] crocket: FMJaggy, It seems robotframework selenium2library would be a lot simpler to use than yadda + mocha + chai + WebdriverJS.
[2014-05-18 07:13:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 815
[2014-05-18 07:15:57] FMJaggy: those examples are for using it within a testing framework, because many people use selenium within a unit testing framework, ex: a Java project might use JUnit + selenium, a node project might use Jasmine+Sel or Mocha+Sel
[2014-05-18 07:16:43] FMJaggy: that doesn't prevent the libraries from being used on their own, the main example on webdriver.io is standalone

[2014-05-18 07:17:55] crocket: FMJaggy, I'm not sure how mocha and yadda could help me.
[2014-05-18 07:18:03] crocket: Maybe, they are unnecessary.
[2014-05-18 07:18:16] FMJaggy: it seems that your original question is about testing frameworks, i would not couple that decision to selenium necessarily, just write some normal unit tests with each framework without selenium
[2014-05-18 07:18:29] sircapsalot, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-05-18 07:18:29] FMJaggy: then pick the one you want to use, then add selenium tests into that
[2014-05-18 07:19:20] crocket: FMJaggy, The problem is that I haven't picked up a framework for javascript.
[2014-05-18 07:21:41] FMJaggy: if you intend to pick up a mvc-ish framework, then i would choose one and use whatever testing library that community uses
[2014-05-18 07:22:26] crocket: FMJaggy, For angularjs, protractor and jasmine is there.
[2014-05-18 07:22:40] crocket: protractor is for e2e test, and jasmine is for unit test.
[2014-05-18 07:22:47] crocket: For non-angularjs applications, there are others.
[2014-05-18 07:22:50] crocket: hell
[2014-05-18 07:23:30] crocket: I consider mocha + yadda as a candidate.
[2014-05-18 07:24:55] FMJaggy: it's easier to learn what the community uses and later deciding to use a less known combination
[2014-05-18 07:26:44] crocket: FMJaggy, The problem is that angularjs exists on an exterior fringe of my company software collections.
[2014-05-18 07:28:17] crocket: FMJaggy, And, I haven't learned angularjs test frameworks yet.
[2014-05-18 07:28:31] crocket: So, in my point of view, they look all the smae.
[2014-05-18 07:28:32] crocket: same.
[2014-05-18 07:28:42] FMJaggy: i'm confused about the project
[2014-05-18 07:28:53] crocket: test is an uncharted territory for me.
[2014-05-18 07:29:01] crocket: FMJaggy, my company has some projects.
[2014-05-18 07:29:13] crocket: Only the latest project adopted angularjs.
[2014-05-18 07:29:24] crocket: I want to apply selenium to various projects.
[2014-05-18 07:29:51] crocket: It's possible to bypass angularjs test framework if I want.
[2014-05-18 07:30:45] FMJaggy: what are the majority of your companies projects written with?
[2014-05-18 07:31:13] crocket: java and javascript
[2014-05-18 07:31:25] crocket: for web projects.
[2014-05-18 07:31:35] crocket: An internal project is written in php and javascript.
[2014-05-18 07:32:04] crocket: non-web projects are written in C and C++.
[2014-05-18 07:32:11] FMJaggy: which langauge is your company most experienced in? are they still invested in this language?
[2014-05-18 07:34:10] FMJaggy: if you are concerned about compatibility with your company, it sounds like something a technical lead should help decide, or someone that knows what testing libraries the company is most invested in
[2014-05-18 07:34:17] crocket: javascript for web projects.
[2014-05-18 07:34:31] crocket: The company currently don't test any project...
[2014-05-18 07:34:41] FMJaggy: well then...
[2014-05-18 07:34:50] crocket: That makes me the technical lead.
[2014-05-18 07:34:59] crocket: unofficially
[2014-05-18 07:37:10] FMJaggy: To me the process seems to be: Choose language, Choose Unit Testing Framework, Choose Selenium library, profit?
[2014-05-18 07:37:16] crocket: I guess yadda + mocha + webdriver would do fine, and it's good to search further.
[2014-05-18 07:37:28] crocket: FMJaggy, profit? I don't know.
[2014-05-18 07:37:48] FMJaggy: thats why it has a question mark
[2014-05-18 07:38:13] crocket: Personally, I don't care about profit much.
[2014-05-18 07:38:26] crocket: I care about my career.
[2014-05-18 07:42:53] crocket: Do I need ATDD or BDD anyway?
