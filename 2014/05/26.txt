[2014-05-26 11:48:57] damnuselenium12: hi, I was in here yesterday trying to get selenium to work, and the suggestion i was given was correct, run selenium in python2.7 vs 3
[2014-05-26 11:49:33] damnuselenium12: specifically from selenium import webdriver throws an exception in firefox_profile.py in python3, but runs fine in python2.7
[2014-05-26 11:49:53] damnuselenium12: "from selenium import webdriver" -> python
[2014-05-26 11:50:49] damnuselenium12: selenium is a dependency for another project, not sure how the dev got it to work but it's not common to just me;
[2014-05-26 11:51:41] damnuselenium12: i guess the question is, is selenium compatible with python3? considering it's almost feasible to re-code project in python2.7, but i'd rather not do that if i can avoid it, it's not my project
[2014-05-26 11:51:55] barancev: damnuselenium12: wait for a patch release, 2.42 is not py3 compatible, sorry :(
