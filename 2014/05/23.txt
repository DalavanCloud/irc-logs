[2014-05-23 02:33:40] AutomatedTester: It seems like if it were a regular issue it would be top priority since our update code gets the most amount of attention
[2014-05-23 02:33:51] AutomatedTester: wonder what could be the cause...

[2014-05-23 02:36:19] simonstewart: Analogous to make, maven, ant or gradle
[2014-05-23 02:37:45] jarib: what are examples of build runners?
[2014-05-23 02:39:26] AutomatedTester: sorry I misread
[2014-05-23 02:39:35] AutomatedTester: they describe it as a command dispatcher

[2014-05-23 02:41:23] AutomatedTester: people in Mozilla

[2014-05-23 02:42:57] AutomatedTester: but I described Mach as a build tool

[2014-05-23 02:44:27] AutomatedTester: which made me wonder if my idea of a build tool is off in my head
[2014-05-23 02:45:35] jarib: we're actually about to write something like that at work
[2014-05-23 02:46:48] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: does buck, either through watchman or not, keep a state of the local tree knowing what should be built if you run it again
[2014-05-23 02:47:02] simonstewart: when you’re using buckd, yes
[2014-05-23 02:47:16] AutomatedTester: oh hawt
[2014-05-23 02:47:49] AutomatedTester: btw, buck gets a mention in my great leap forward

[2014-05-23 02:48:36] simonstewart: One of the things that I really want to add to buck is to sandbox the python we execute

[2014-05-23 06:44:57] oich: When selenium launches firefox, there is a webdriver addon. If I run console open and then help in the 2nd console I get to a help page that refers to the cd function. But, it says thd cd function doesn't exist. How do, I for example, get a WebDriver instance in the console?
[2014-05-23 06:46:01] oich: that's 2 questions... where is the cd functino, so I can "cd" into an iframe? Or, how do I di WebDrivery things in the WebDriver console?
[2014-05-23 06:46:35] AutomatedTester: oich: do you mean an IDE?
[2014-05-23 06:48:12] oich: firefox
[2014-05-23 06:49:21] oich: I open a window and have problems with my test. So, I want to inspect things. It says the addon is the firefox WebDriver addon. so I was hoping I could use webdriver objects
[2014-05-23 06:49:59] AutomatedTester: the webdriver addon is only there when you have a browser started by webdriver
[2014-05-23 06:50:29] oich: ok. can I get access to a webdriver object?
[2014-05-23 06:50:59] AutomatedTester: yes... from your code
[2014-05-23 06:51:12] oich: what does the addon do then?
[2014-05-23 06:51:25] AutomatedTester: it handles the communication from your code to the browser
[2014-05-23 06:51:27] oich: oh.. I mean the console for the addon
