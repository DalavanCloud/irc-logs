[2014-05-29 07:27:29] ato: Things like recursive extension of input data from the main template are pretty fucking cool.
[2014-05-29 07:27:44] ato: It messes with your mind when you properly get it.
[2014-05-29 07:29:53] ato: You define a template which can be applied to any element in the source file you apply it to.  The source file can call a template with arguments, which again can recursively make changes upwards again.
[2014-05-29 07:30:01] ato: It's pretty mindblowing stuff.
[2014-05-29 07:32:12] ato: jimevans: I'm sorry.  You put on too many coins now.
[2014-05-29 07:32:46] ato: It would be interesting to implement the whole thing as s-expressions, as my impression is that people who dislike XSLT dislike it mostly for its XML.

[2014-05-29 13:48:49] nVitius: I'm not sure, I'm using Behat's Mink
[2014-05-29 13:48:55] nVitius: It has a resize() function
[2014-05-29 13:49:31] AutomatedTester: you knowing the jsonwire call means the binding isnt doing a good job
