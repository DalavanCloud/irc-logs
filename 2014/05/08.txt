[2014-05-08 11:10:39] sircapsalot: WebDriver i think was originally Google though, right? the brilliant author
[2014-05-08 11:10:41] sircapsalot: Simon
[2014-05-08 11:11:09] lukeis: um, well i believe both Selenium and WebDriver were started at ThoughtWorks
[2014-05-08 11:11:26] lukeis: and the creators moved to google and continued there
[2014-05-08 11:11:42] lukeis: and they have since moved on from google :)

[2014-05-08 19:40:20] sjuxax: Hello. I am using Selenium with Python. It seems that I can only get the .text value for a specific element once. After that, the value is always None. How can I make that not happen?

[2014-05-08 20:09:14] dude-x: sjuxax: why would you call .text twice on a webelement?
[2014-05-08 20:11:43] sjuxax: because i want to know its text multiple times? why would selenium NOT allow me to do that?
[2014-05-08 20:12:42] sjuxax: if the claim is perfomance it's selenium's responsibility to memoize, functions shouldn't just stop working because they've already been used once
[2014-05-08 20:13:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 834
[2014-05-08 20:13:49] sjuxax: however in this particular case I want to know the value multiple times because the page I'm on occasionally redraws the box, so I can't just iterate over elements; if i click the element, the box goes away and all remaining elements in the group get deleted from DOM
[2014-05-08 20:14:18] sjuxax: so i have to look up the text value of each element to see if this is the new element with the same value

[2014-05-08 20:19:35] dude-x: Are you sure the element is suppose to have text?
[2014-05-08 20:19:47] dude-x: if the dom is being changed, then you should re-find the element
[2014-05-08 20:22:41] dude-x: when you call find_element() it looks up the element, stores it in a cache, at that particular moment the DOM state is in.
[2014-05-08 20:22:58] dude-x: if you were to futz around with the browser; then that element becomes stale.
