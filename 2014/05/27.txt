[2014-05-27 00:40:34] WLP|Away: barancev: I downloaded the your WebDriver Extensions, but as is typical of Selenium stuff, the documentation is minimal.  I haven't figured out how to use them.  Nor can I even tell if it's worth it.
[2014-05-27 00:43:02] barancev: WLP|Away: yes, there is no documentation yet :)
[2014-05-27 00:43:17] WLP|Away: Got a sample or tutorial?
[2014-05-27 00:43:29] WLP|Away: I haven't made heads or tails of it.

[2014-05-27 00:44:16] WLP|Away: I don't understand how one source file from the system would help.
[2014-05-27 00:44:30] barancev: it is a sample
[2014-05-27 00:44:51] barancev: 1) create a handler that implements UnhandledAlertHandler
[2014-05-27 00:45:38] barancev: 2) create a wrapper, register the handler, get a wrapper driver and use it
[2014-05-27 00:46:14] barancev: https://gist.github.com/barancev/0de9902b3f9eb246ad53
[2014-05-27 00:46:58] barancev: instead of throwing UnhandledAlertException it will call handleUnhandledAlert method in the handler
[2014-05-27 00:48:11] barancev: s/get a wrapper driver and use it/get a wrapped driver and use it/
[2014-05-27 00:49:57] barancev: btw, time to update it to 2.42

[2014-05-27 16:52:46] humanbird: mine was slightly different in that i was waiting for an element to not have a class
[2014-05-27 16:53:04] LocusAsaf: yes I see, I think the pseudo selectors would work well for you there
[2014-05-27 16:53:18] LocusAsaf: I've used those quite a bit and they are really right on for this when you wrap them in a webdriver wait
[2014-05-27 16:53:48] LocusAsaf: I guess if nobody is around I'll just test it myself and see if it works
[2014-05-27 16:54:30] humanbird: i ended up using a webdirver wait
[2014-05-27 16:54:51] humanbird: successOf (new WebDriverWait(driver,5), not(presenceOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector('#complete-button .active'))))
[2014-05-27 16:54:53] LocusAsaf: yeah, I wrap every find css etc... in explicit waits
[2014-05-27 16:55:00] humanbird: where successOf is some do while junk
[2014-05-27 16:55:10] LocusAsaf: cool
[2014-05-27 16:55:29] LocusAsaf: have you used the pseudo selectors before?
[2014-05-27 16:55:45] humanbird: the contains one for text
[2014-05-27 16:55:54] humanbird: but mostly we use linktext
[2014-05-27 16:56:02] humanbird: find element by linktext
[2014-05-27 16:56:05] LocusAsaf: the pseudo stuff doesn't work for text
[2014-05-27 16:56:09] LocusAsaf: just css
[2014-05-27 16:56:14] LocusAsaf: its not specific to webdriver
[2014-05-27 16:56:30] LocusAsaf: from what people tell me here theres no good way to check for text with css
[2014-05-27 16:56:46] LocusAsaf: the psuedo selector stuff is mostly good for id's, classes & element attributes changing
[2014-05-27 16:56:53] humanbird: ok
[2014-05-27 16:56:58] LocusAsaf: very useful for detecting changes to ajaxy stuff on your page
[2014-05-27 16:57:35] LocusAsaf: so if your page is dynamically being changed by ajax, comet, websockets and not reloading you can detect elements hiding, coming into view etc...
[2014-05-27 16:57:45] LocusAsaf: using css
[2014-05-27 16:59:03] LocusAsaf: for instance if there is some element thats like <div id="elem" style="hidden"> you can test for '#elem:not(style="hidden")' and as soon as the element is not hidden style it will return
[2014-05-27 16:59:39] humanbird: you don't have to explicitly spin wait for this?
[2014-05-27 16:59:47] LocusAsaf: you do still have to wrap it in wait
[2014-05-27 17:00:06] LocusAsaf: webdriver is so fast that I wrap it all in waits
[2014-05-27 17:00:39] LocusAsaf: otherwise it will fail in the 10 ms in between that the page takes to change
[2014-05-27 17:01:04] LocusAsaf: I just wrapped my driver.find_element_by_css function inside of a webdriver wait and call that instead so I never think about it
[2014-05-27 17:01:55] LocusAsaf: my_find_css(elem) { webdriver.wait(5, { driver.find_element.css(elem) } )
[2014-05-27 17:02:07] LocusAsaf: that's pseudo code but its essentially like that

[2014-05-27 17:02:42] humanbird: i wonder why it's not in there by default
[2014-05-27 17:02:49] LocusAsaf: yeah Im guessing you're using Java implementation so that would be the way to go
[2014-05-27 17:03:16] LocusAsaf: I'm not sure I guess they leave more control to the developers in the case where you don't want to wait at all
[2014-05-27 17:04:15] humanbird: eh...
[2014-05-27 17:04:24] humanbird: but the amount of timing problems especially when using sauceconnect
[2014-05-27 17:04:32] humanbird: i doubt it wasn't an oversight
[2014-05-27 17:04:45] LocusAsaf: I'm not qualified to say why it is the way it is
[2014-05-27 17:05:08] LocusAsaf: don't go grumbling on my account I could be misleading you with an xy problem here
[2014-05-27 17:05:27] LocusAsaf: all I can say is that the pages i'm testing are not responsive enough to handle things without waits
[2014-05-27 17:05:41] humanbird: most things on the internet.
[2014-05-27 17:06:21] humanbird: i click a button and navigate to another page. even something this simple, i gotta wait for the ajax that would've updated the next page's layout...
[2014-05-27 17:06:26] *LocusAsaf shrugs'
[2014-05-27 17:06:52] humanbird: click button -> ajax stuff happens -> navigate to other page before ajax stuff happens -> dead
[2014-05-27 17:07:11] LocusAsaf: well that makes me feel a bit better that we are not alone there
[2014-05-27 17:19:59] humanbird: there's no general solution for this
[2014-05-27 17:20:34] humanbird: i click "complete document button" navigate to next page where i would expect "this document is completed" message. i can't webdriver wait for something that shouldn't even exist on the page i'm on
