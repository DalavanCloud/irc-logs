I know we have ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By) but that still passes if for example there is another div on the page overlapping the element or text we're trying to test
[2014-05-22 08:44:32] WhereIsMySpoon: In that case the underlying element is still "visible" in the css sense, but is not visible to the person viewing the page

[2014-05-22 08:47:37] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: it's 3 lines of java and just 2 divs, one on top of the other with z-index
[2014-05-22 08:47:39] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-05-22 08:49:06] lukeis: if you use chromedriver and try to click on the element it will give you an exception and you'll know it's then not visible (as a work-around to the current visibility bug)
[2014-05-22 08:49:16] lukeis: but it's not likely to get fixed soon
[2014-05-22 08:49:48] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: its just a div, you cant click it
[2014-05-22 08:50:08] lukeis: why not? you can't click it with your mouse?
[2014-05-22 08:50:12] lukeis: (so what if it does nothing)
[2014-05-22 08:50:27] WhereIsMySpoon: I thought divs weren't clickable and would throw an elementnotclickable exception
[2014-05-22 08:50:33] WhereIsMySpoon: if you tried to lcikc them
[2014-05-22 08:50:34] WhereIsMySpoon: click
[2014-05-22 08:50:39] lukeis: never heard of such an exception ;)
[2014-05-22 08:51:01] lukeis: you'll get an exception only if the element is not visible
[2014-05-22 08:51:08] WhereIsMySpoon: hm ok
[2014-05-22 08:51:18] lukeis: and <div onclick="….">  makes it clickable ;)

[2014-05-22 08:59:32] WhereIsMySpoon: because this way only allows you to know that *something* is in front of it
[2014-05-22 08:59:48] lukeis: i think there's a way to get the element at a point (with javascript)
[2014-05-22 09:00:06] WhereIsMySpoon: that was actually going to be my next question
[2014-05-22 09:00:18] WhereIsMySpoon: is there a way to do layout detection with absolute coords in selenium

[2014-05-22 09:00:38] lukeis: not directly with selenium, you'll need to use the Javascript executor

[2014-05-22 15:52:42] AutomatedTester: I did remove the python items
[2014-05-22 15:52:47] lukeis: "Remove deprecated functions."  dammit… which ones!
[2014-05-22 15:53:10] AutomatedTester: that imo should be in a changelog
[2014-05-22 15:53:18] AutomatedTester: shame that its not a useful message
[2014-05-22 15:53:26] AutomatedTester: but should still be there
[2014-05-22 15:53:42] lukeis: yes, i concur… just not helpful
[2014-05-22 15:54:24] AutomatedTester: but it means people can grep the log for that commit message and go from there
