[2014-05-09 01:30:02] Karmik: I'm using python with webdriver to scrape the content of a table in an ajax web page. Is there any trick to scraping the value of a cell AFTER it's been populated by an ajax call? when the page loads, the cell has "--" and in a few seconds it gets filled with an integer. Putting a "sleep" before the actual scraping function doesn't work.

[2014-05-09 01:56:55] moo-_-: Karmik: yes
[2014-05-09 01:57:23] moo-_-: you can have a sleep loop to check when the table is filled with CSS selectors
[2014-05-09 01:57:32] moo-_-: and do not proceed to the scraping until the table has rows
[2014-05-09 01:57:38] Karmik: the rows are there at the start
[2014-05-09 01:57:39] moo-_-: the same can be applied to the cell content
[2014-05-09 01:57:42] Karmik: only the values pop up later.
[2014-05-09 01:58:02] Karmik: and to make things worse, the "id" of the interesting cell has a randomized componend
[2014-05-09 01:58:25] Karmik: the id is stringA_stringB_RNG where A and B are fixed and predictable
[2014-05-09 01:58:36] JamesPrescott, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-09 01:58:44] Karmik: RNG is a 5 digits integer that changes every time
[2014-05-09 01:59:15] moo-_-: Karmik: you can use CSS selectors to target cells
[2014-05-09 01:59:23] moo-_-: table > tbody > tr > td
[2014-05-09 02:00:03] moo-_-: Karmik: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18294420/315168
[2014-05-09 02:00:34] Karmik: so i have two problems, locating the element i can fix with css selectors rather than straight id
[2014-05-09 02:01:00] Karmik: what about waiting until the value appears to scrape it? what kind of condition should i use? the cell is already there so i can't use waitonelement
[2014-05-09 02:01:15] moo-_-: 1) locate the element using CSS
[2014-05-09 02:01:25] moo-_-: 2) have a sleep loop to check if elemenet.text == "--"

[2014-05-09 09:05:41] Prometheian: I'm trying to get all my tests to fail in a test suite when one fails. I have an @Rule that catches the failure for reporting reasons, but I'm not sure how to pass a boolean back and forth.
[2014-05-09 09:07:32] lukeis: Prometheian: create a Runner class and annotate your test classes with @RunWith
[2014-05-09 09:07:48] lukeis: in the runner you'll be able to stop the propagation of new tests running
[2014-05-09 09:07:59] lukeis: (by using the Assume)
[2014-05-09 09:08:25] lukeis: Or if you have a @Before you can add to a base test class that all extend from you can add the Assume
[2014-05-09 09:08:30] Prometheian: http://selenium-junit4-runner.btmatthews.com/ ?
[2014-05-09 09:09:03] lukeis: I would (and do) write my own Runner class
[2014-05-09 09:09:13] lukeis: i wouldn't use "SeleniumJUnit4ClassRunner"

[2014-05-09 09:14:50] Prometheian: wat do
[2014-05-09 09:18:15] barancev: Prometheian: what's the purpose? you can group tests in a suite and watch the suite result
[2014-05-09 09:18:52] Prometheian: Because of how these are run (against selenium grid, started via command line) that doesn't really work out. And since I can't rerun failures that way I just want it all gone.
[2014-05-09 09:19:42] barancev: do you want to skip all tests after first failure?
[2014-05-09 09:19:48] Prometheian: yes
[2014-05-09 09:21:30] barancev: 1) create a static boolean flag skipBecauseFailue, 2) create a @Rule that sets this flag after a failure? 3) add an assume to each test or another @Rule that skips all tests if the flag is true

[2014-05-09 09:41:11] Prometheian: driver.findElement().getText or whatev
[2014-05-09 09:41:14] LocusAsaf: is there a way to do an explicit wait on text?
[2014-05-09 09:41:18] lukeis: use an expected condition with a webdriver wait :waits
