[2014-05-20 13:24:40] tkeith: I'm trying to enter a username on this site, but the overlay element is causing problems: https://online.citibank.com/US/JSO/signon/LocaleUsernameSignon.do?locale=en_US
[2014-05-20 13:24:45] tkeith: Anyone have any suggestions?
[2014-05-20 13:24:58] dimacus: tkeith: let me tak e a look
[2014-05-20 13:25:02] tkeith: I've tried clicking on it, then sending keys, and sending keys to both inputs, but nothing seems to work
[2014-05-20 13:25:14] tkeith: I'm using Chrome
[2014-05-20 13:25:36] dimacus: so the #usernameMasked is the overlay and #username is actual?
[2014-05-20 13:25:52] tkeith: dimacus: Yeah, I think so at least
[2014-05-20 13:26:52] tkeith: dimacus: usernameMasked appears also after you enter text to star out part of it
[2014-05-20 13:27:04] tkeith: like such: <input id="usernameMasked" name="usernameMasked" class="userMask" maxlength="50" type="text" size="21" value="as***da">
[2014-05-20 13:27:28] dimacus: ok so it seems that #username is hidden
[2014-05-20 13:27:40] dimacus: and #usernameMasked is visible
[2014-05-20 13:27:48] dimacus: until you send some keys int #usernameMasked
[2014-05-20 13:27:51] dimacus: then they flip
[2014-05-20 13:28:12] dimacus: actually just clicking on the field makes them flip, at least according to firebug
[2014-05-20 13:28:34] tkeith: That's why I thought clicking on #usernameMasked and then sending keys to #username would work
[2014-05-20 13:28:35] dimacus: this is deffinetlye a fun one :-P
[2014-05-20 13:28:40] tkeith: but it says #username isn't visible
[2014-05-20 13:28:56] dimacus: have you tried to click on #username first?
[2014-05-20 13:29:10] dimacus: or… click on #usernameMasked followed by clicking on #username?
[2014-05-20 13:29:29] lukeis: i just got it to work by clicking on usernameMasked then sending keys to username
[2014-05-20 13:29:49] dimacus: ok i think i have a crazy work around :-P
[2014-05-20 13:30:24] tkeith: Oh wait... this worked: time.sleep(1); wd.find_element_by_id('usernameMasked').click(); wd.find_element_by_id('username').send_keys('asdf')
[2014-05-20 13:30:30] tkeith: but I had to alt-tab to chrome
[2014-05-20 13:30:49] dimacus: ok you need to deal with jQuery animations and setting window to front
[2014-05-20 13:30:54] tkeith: I'm testing this on Mac OS and it seems it can't send keys to the element in Chrome if it's not actie?
[2014-05-20 13:31:05] dimacus: it's similar in Firefox
[2014-05-20 13:31:26] tkeith: Is this a Mac-specific thing? usually I run these things on Linux, this is just for testing
[2014-05-20 13:31:26] dimacus: it's not a browser issue, it seems to be (my running theory) a jQuery issue
[2014-05-20 13:31:31] tkeith: Hmm
[2014-05-20 13:31:35] dimacus: where if a window is not currently in focus
[2014-05-20 13:31:47] dimacus: jQuery does not "always" function the way it should
[2014-05-20 13:31:50] tkeith: Is there a way to make it think it's always in focus?
[2014-05-20 13:31:53] tkeith: (the window)
[2014-05-20 13:32:01] dimacus: yes, depending on target OS
[2014-05-20 13:32:32] dimacus: this is what i do in ruby
[2014-05-20 13:32:33] dimacus: def bring_current_window_to_front
[2014-05-20 13:32:34] dimacus:    @selenium.switch_to.window(@selenium.window_handles.first)
[2014-05-20 13:32:34] dimacus: end
[2014-05-20 13:32:51] dimacus: basically switch to the current window, this forces the browser window to come to the top if it's covered by something
[2014-05-20 13:33:03] tkeith: Hmm, but in production I run a lot of sessions on the same server, so won't they all fight for focus and randomly fail?
[2014-05-20 13:33:15] dimacus: ok will this be running on Linux?
[2014-05-20 13:33:23] tkeith: Yes
[2014-05-20 13:33:35] dimacus: fear not my friend, the next awesome solution is this

[2014-05-20 13:33:56] tkeith: But not critical
[2014-05-20 13:34:12] dimacus: before you start a browser for each session, start a new VNC instance per browser, and then set your DISPLAY to match that XWindows instance
[2014-05-20 13:34:26] dimacus: i've had 8 to 10 tests running in parallel on boxes before without any issues
[2014-05-20 13:34:43] dimacus: plus you can individually VNC into each window and see what's going no, no longer sitting on top of each other
[2014-05-20 13:35:07] tkeith: Oh god this is bad
[2014-05-20 13:35:14] dimacus: if you combine the switch_to.window and a separate display per browser instance, your test stability goes up to 99%

[2014-05-20 13:36:02] tkeith: How do you automatically start VNCs?
[2014-05-20 13:36:26] dimacus: well i use "fluxbox" for virtual displays
[2014-05-20 13:36:39] dimacus: (you don't have to, but it's nicer than default xwindows)
[2014-05-20 13:36:48] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-20 13:36:58] dimacus: and you need to run "vncserver :1 -geometry=1024x768"
[2014-05-20 13:37:16] dimacus: first time you run vncserver, it will ask you to install one of vnc servers available for your distro
[2014-05-20 13:37:30] dimacus: after that, everything is just an environment variable
[2014-05-20 13:37:31] tkeith: I mean automatically launching them for each session
[2014-05-20 13:37:46] tkeith: I already run selenium in xvfb, so I probably just need more xvfb's
[2014-05-20 13:37:51] dimacus: yup
[2014-05-20 13:37:55] dimacus: xvfb is more than enough
[2014-05-20 13:37:59] dimacus: what language you are using?

[2014-05-20 13:39:46] dimacus: i overwrite the new browser session getter, and using jarib's VNCTools gem, which you can find on github, so before calling the "super" I do this
[2014-05-20 13:40:04] dimacus: VncTools::Server.executable = "vncserver"
[2014-05-20 13:40:05] dimacus: @vnc_server = VncTools::Server.new
