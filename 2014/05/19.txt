[2014-05-19 07:38:29] simonstewart: crocket: depends on who you ask.
[2014-05-19 07:38:36] crocket: who?
[2014-05-19 07:38:45] crocket: Of course, everyone has different opinions.
[2014-05-19 07:39:04] crocket: simonstewart, Do you know a fairly good framework for driving selenium?
[2014-05-19 07:39:06] simonstewart: I’d plump for python or ruby, because I find node.js to be filled with hipsters who practice FDD (Fashion Driven Development)
[2014-05-19 07:39:09] crocket: a good test framework
[2014-05-19 07:39:14] simonstewart: I use junit
[2014-05-19 07:39:16] ato: Shardvexz: You might have luck with autoconverting them using 2to3?
[2014-05-19 07:39:18] crocket: what the hell?
[2014-05-19 07:39:24] crocket: simonstewart, junit is for java.
[2014-05-19 07:39:36] simonstewart: You asked for a good framework.
[2014-05-19 07:39:39] simonstewart: That’s what I use
[2014-05-19 07:39:40] ato: crocket: Python, use pytest or unittest.
[2014-05-19 07:39:46] simonstewart: I guess python would be nose
[2014-05-19 07:39:47] crocket: huh
[2014-05-19 07:39:49] crocket: nose?
[2014-05-19 07:39:56] ato: nose is decent too.

[2014-05-19 07:40:19] crocket: Hell
[2014-05-19 07:40:21] ato: Ruby has Unit::Test or whatever it's called.
[2014-05-19 07:40:32] crocket: simonstewart, I thought you were talking about a human body part.
[2014-05-19 07:40:43] crocket: So, ruby or python?
[2014-05-19 07:40:50] crocket: Oh, it's a difficult choice.
[2014-05-19 07:41:15] simonstewart: crocket:  :)
[2014-05-19 07:41:31] simonstewart: I like them both, so it depends on who I get to collaborate with
[2014-05-19 07:41:47] crocket: simonstewart, I work with my CEO who knows ruby well.
[2014-05-19 07:41:49] simonstewart: I just head to where the most people who can do all the work for me are :)
[2014-05-19 07:41:56] simonstewart: Ruby it probably is, then
[2014-05-19 07:42:08] crocket: However, my coworkers tend to know javascript well.
[2014-05-19 07:42:16] crocket: I also want to preach selenium to my coworkers.
[2014-05-19 07:42:33] crocket: simonstewart, Plus, the CEO wanted to use the best test framework regardless of language.
[2014-05-19 07:42:36] simonstewart: Put it to the popular vote? And if you don’t like the answer tell people “it’s not a democracy” and pick the language you like
[2014-05-19 07:42:37] crocket: It makes the decision difficult.
[2014-05-19 07:42:49] jimevans: "best" framework?
[2014-05-19 07:42:54] simonstewart: crocket: “the best framework” depends on so many factors
[2014-05-19 07:42:59] crocket: the best framework for driving selenium.
[2014-05-19 07:43:01] simonstewart: There’s no one-size-fits-all
[2014-05-19 07:43:07] jimevans: +1
[2014-05-19 07:43:10] crocket: huh
[2014-05-19 07:43:15] crocket: simonstewart, However, there are bad frameworks.
[2014-05-19 07:43:22] crocket: And, there are very good frameworks.

[2014-05-19 07:43:27] simonstewart: There are several “one-size-chafes-most” frameworks, though
[2014-05-19 07:43:49] crocket: What about one-size-fits-most?
[2014-05-19 07:44:01] crocket: or one-size-fits-many

[2014-05-19 07:48:56] cgoldberg: crocket, what is the app you are testing written in?
[2014-05-19 07:49:06] crocket: php + javascript or java + javascript
[2014-05-19 07:49:13] crocket: Obviously, most web apps are written in javascript.
[2014-05-19 07:49:30] cgoldberg: crocket, tests (IMHO) should be coupled with code under test.. and in the same language
[2014-05-19 07:49:36] cgoldberg: if you want a chance to have them maintained
[2014-05-19 07:49:58] crocket: cgoldberg, So, mocha + WebdriverJS?
[2014-05-19 07:50:14] crocket: Mocha seems to be the most advanced test framework on javascript.
[2014-05-19 07:50:24] jimevans: meh, i don't think that's *so* obvious. yes, that's what's rendered in the browser, but the thing creating the rendered HTML/CSS/JavaScript is often very much *not* javascript.
[2014-05-19 07:50:25] barancev: most web apps are written in php :)
[2014-05-19 07:50:52] crocket: barancev, In server part.
[2014-05-19 07:50:55] cgoldberg: barancev, unfortunately true :)
[2014-05-19 07:51:05] crocket: php is a server-side language.
[2014-05-19 07:51:18] crocket: I want to test client-side behaviors.
[2014-05-19 07:51:23] simonstewart: Note to self: two ant builds trampling each other is a hilarious way to ruin an afternoon
[2014-05-19 07:51:37] crocket: jimevans, Unfortunately, most of programmers don't still use altjs languages.
[2014-05-19 07:52:03] ingshtrom: @jimevans: I am trying to build and test the .net bindings.  I have tried just running 'go dotnet', 'go //dotnet', 'go //dotnet:core', but everytime I get the error, "Don't know how to build task 'xxx'" where xxx is whatever I specified as a rake task
[2014-05-19 07:52:13] crocket: jimevans, I guess you referred to elm.
[2014-05-19 07:52:52] crocket: cgoldberg, Why does selenium have python and ruby bindings if most web apps are not written in python and ruby?
[2014-05-19 07:53:06] jimevans: crocket: i would dispute that. "many", sure. "most"? i'd need to see evidence of that. there are *lots* of programmers doing *lots* of apps, many of which are only peripherally related to the internet/web.
[2014-05-19 07:53:31] jimevans: ingshtrom: yep. those targets don't exist.
[2014-05-19 07:53:33] cgoldberg: crocket, many apps are written in Python and Ruby... rails.. django.. etc
[2014-05-19 07:53:35] crocket: jimevans, I mean most web programmers.
[2014-05-19 07:53:42] crocket: cgoldberg, in server-side.
[2014-05-19 07:54:12] crocket: Oh
[2014-05-19 07:54:20] barancev: crocket: with selenium you don't deal with client side code directly
[2014-05-19 07:54:43] crocket: If web apps are written in ruby on server side, programmers would know ruby, and they'll use ruby to write web UI tests.
[2014-05-19 07:54:54] jimevans: crocket: the point is that if you have an app that's build with <not javascript language> "server-side", you probably have people in-house who are proficient in <not javascript language> who can also help write webdriver code in <not javascript language>
[2014-05-19 07:55:01] papegaaij, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-05-19 07:55:01] crocket: Although web UI tests don't directly interact with server-side, either.
[2014-05-19 07:55:22] crocket: jimevans, I get the logic now.
[2014-05-19 07:55:23] barancev: that's why you can choose any language you want
[2014-05-19 07:55:24] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-19 07:55:40] ingshtrom: jimevans: I was looking in the main Rakefile and they seems to exist... oh well. What is the target for building test .Net bindings, now?
[2014-05-19 07:55:49] barancev: and you can use "non-technical" reasons to choose a language
[2014-05-19 07:55:52] jimevans: ingshtrom: what tests specifically are you trying to run, and which target(s) do you really want to build?
[2014-05-19 07:55:53] crocket: So, it is best to choose a language used in server-side or client-side.
[2014-05-19 07:56:14] crocket: In this case, javascript would be a good choice.
[2014-05-19 07:56:24] cgoldberg: crocket, depends.. all apps use essentially the same client side language (JS)
[2014-05-19 07:56:30] cgoldberg: that doesnt mean its your best choice
[2014-05-19 07:56:31] crocket: cgoldberg, you see?
[2014-05-19 07:56:45] cgoldberg: for example.. if ALL of that JS is created by your python framework
[2014-05-19 07:56:46] barancev: crocket: if you like promices :)
[2014-05-19 07:56:50] crocket: cgoldberg, I don't know if other programmers in my company know python or ruby.
[2014-05-19 07:57:08] crocket: barancev, I prefer promises to callbacks, but I don't necessarily like it.
[2014-05-19 07:57:19] crocket: promises are good for asynchronicity.
[2014-05-19 07:57:33] jimevans: ingshtrom: yes, the //dotnet target "exists" in the main rakefile, but the actual targets that's an alias for have changed, and i never actually updated the main rakefile.
[2014-05-19 07:57:47] crocket: cgoldberg, Our programmers write js directly.
[2014-05-19 07:57:48] barancev: selenium JS bindings use promices actively
[2014-05-19 07:58:04] crocket: barancev, Is it asynchronous by nature?
[2014-05-19 07:58:27] crocket: barancev, Do other langauge bindings use callbacks instead?
[2014-05-19 07:58:38] barancev: no idea why
[2014-05-19 07:58:48] barancev: other bindings don't use callbacks at all
[2014-05-19 07:58:55] jimevans: ingshtrom: to build the main .NET bindings, you should use 'go //dotnet/src/webdriver:webdriver'
[2014-05-19 07:58:56] crocket: huh
[2014-05-19 07:58:59] simonstewart: continuations are even better than promises
[2014-05-19 07:58:59] crocket: It's a mysterious.
[2014-05-19 07:59:11] crocket: Using promises for synchronous code is non-sense.
[2014-05-19 07:59:24] crocket: simonstewart, What is continuation?
[2014-05-19 07:59:50] barancev: may be jleyba or admc can explain why they use promices
[2014-05-19 08:00:03] ingshtrom: jimevans: yeah, sorry for the delay. I need to build and test webdriver for https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/218, so that will work. thanks!
[2014-05-19 08:00:31] simonstewart: crocket: this might help http://jlongster.com/2012/10/05/javascript-yield.html
[2014-05-19 08:00:58] crocket: simonstewart, I know what yield is.
[2014-05-19 08:01:13] jimevans: ingshtrom: also, it would be useful if you could squash your commits before finalizing the pull request.
[2014-05-19 08:02:08] ingshtrom: yeah, I will do that after I write the tests :)
[2014-05-19 08:02:20] crocket: cgoldberg, I'm still confused.
[2014-05-19 08:02:26] crocket: javascript is not a bad language.
[2014-05-19 08:02:49] crocket: python and ruby? I don't know them well.
[2014-05-19 08:02:53] jimevans: crocket: now *that* is a matter of opinion. :)

[2014-05-19 08:03:51] jimevans: okay, fair enough.
[2014-05-19 08:03:54] crocket: If I write selenium tests in ruby or python, other programmers may not maintain them.
[2014-05-19 08:04:16] crocket: Or they'd hate me for it if they don't like to learn new languages.
[2014-05-19 08:04:35] crocket: The problem is that it's not an open source project.

[2014-05-19 09:22:22] plightbo_work: lukeis: just responded. I respect your opinion, but I don't agree with it. Fortunately there is an easy fix: we can quickly determine what value Sauce Labs is providing us today.

[2014-05-19 09:24:21] plightbo_work: can someone explain to me how we use it? better: can I have a login to the service to see historical usag?

[2014-05-19 09:24:28] selbot2: Jenkins: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ | Dashboard: http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[2014-05-19 09:24:44] lukeis: we use it for ALL of the projects tests...
[2014-05-19 09:24:48] lukeis: we use it heavily
[2014-05-19 09:25:33] lukeis: basically the price point we need to look for is "7 parallel threads" from sauce labs
[2014-05-19 09:25:59] plightbo_work: can you get me a login to the service itself so I can see usage history?
[2014-05-19 09:26:32] lukeis: hugs|away sahazel  ^
[2014-05-19 09:26:56] lukeis: i don't have the login to the sauce labs account for Selenium
[2014-05-19 09:27:24] plightbo_work: For example, their list price is $149/mo for 6 threads + 30 hours of testing. That comes out to less than $2k/year. So unless our usage is 10X more I'm not immediately seeing a Selenium-level sponsorship here ($20k)
[2014-05-19 09:27:43] plightbo_work: but maybe we're using 200 hours + 7 threads and it works out much more closely
[2014-05-19 09:28:10] lukeis: we use a lot more hours than that i believe
[2014-05-19 09:28:24] lukeis: unless i'm mistaken on the pricing model
[2014-05-19 09:28:38] lukeis: my work has a much different agreement
[2014-05-19 09:28:52] lukeis: (hours aren't involved in the details)
[2014-05-19 09:30:14] plightbo_work: cool well once we get the details ironed out we can take quick action

[2014-05-19 11:25:16] barancev: reproduced with oracle java 7 and old jython
[2014-05-19 11:25:25] barancev: so, should be fixed now, cool!

[2014-05-19 11:44:44] jimevans: it'd be awesome if we could just kill the jobs already in progress that we *know* are going to fail.
[2014-05-19 11:45:01] lukeis: we can...
[2014-05-19 11:45:15] lukeis: hit the red x (after you sign in) ;)
[2014-05-19 11:45:25] jimevans: if i could sign in :)
[2014-05-19 11:45:33] lukeis: you should really remedy that
[2014-05-19 11:45:42] lukeis: :-D
[2014-05-19 11:45:43] jimevans: three logins to jenkins. can't remember the password to any of them.

[2014-05-19 11:46:10] lukeis: dude…. last pass… our company gives it to us for free.
[2014-05-19 11:46:12] manoj9788, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-05-19 11:46:23] jimevans: doesn't solve the problem. :)
[2014-05-19 11:46:38] jimevans: which existed before i had access to lastpass.
[2014-05-19 11:46:40] lukeis: you need seva to admin reset on selenium ci
[2014-05-19 11:46:56] lukeis: otherwise i'd help ya ;)
[2014-05-19 11:47:02] jimevans: i'm sure.
[2014-05-19 11:47:42] MetalHead77: Anyone know if it is possible to extract sponsored ads from facebook's newsfeed into your application?
[2014-05-19 11:47:43] MetalHead77: Ads such as http://prntscr.com/3k5e4f
[2014-05-19 11:50:00] dimacus: MetalHead77: why?
[2014-05-19 11:50:18] MetalHead77: dimacus: I'm doing it for a client
[2014-05-19 11:50:47] dimacus: well… i'm not 100% sure if using selenium would be the best apraoch
[2014-05-19 11:51:06] MetalHead77: dimacus: What do you think would be the best approach?
[2014-05-19 11:51:20] ddary, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-05-19 11:51:31] dimacus: javascript, some real programing language, and some html parsing
[2014-05-19 11:52:27] MetalHead77: dimacus: the problem is that facebooks ads change dynamically in the html source code
[2014-05-19 11:52:51] MetalHead77: i can't even find it in the source code to begin with
[2014-05-19 11:53:32] dimacus: MetalHead77: the other problem is, what is the legality/terms of service adherence of doing that
[2014-05-19 11:53:59] jimevans: dimacus: +1
[2014-05-19 11:54:53] dimacus: MetalHead77: but i think you should look up CSS selectors, and that would answer the technical part of your question not the ethical one

[2014-05-19 11:57:16] plightbo_work: santiycr: are you the only one who has a login to the actual Sauce service? lukeis said he doesn't. I'm assuming that is where we'd see usage history in the form of a $0 invoice or something like that, yes?
[2014-05-19 11:58:20] MetalHead77: dimacus: Then your just talking blindly. Scraping facebook is completely different than your regular website

[2014-05-19 11:59:10] dimacus: MetalHead77: no i've been testing much much more complicated websites then facebook… honestly if you trully understand html and CSS and some javascript you will be able to figure it all out :)
[2014-05-19 11:59:43] MetalHead77: How do you know the complexity if you have not even looked at it?

[2014-05-19 12:32:46] jarib: dude-x: the quote is roughly: when we look at the amount of videos and the fact that they are using youtube, i'm thinking it's a big corporation who are testing video encoding and measuring how youtube are compressing the videos

[2014-05-19 13:05:22] dimacus: and i'm guessing latest jdk is good enough
[2014-05-19 13:05:52] jimevans: 2.x should be alright. i build with that regularly. you probably want python 2.7.x
[2014-05-19 13:05:59] jimevans: latest jdk is good.

[2014-05-19 13:36:52] jimevans: Mozleron: probably not. we don't maintain either of those packages.

[2014-05-19 13:37:09] Mozleron: Ahh.  Any advice on where to look?
[2014-05-19 13:37:27] jimevans: no idea. they're not officially created or maintained by the selenium project.
[2014-05-19 13:37:52] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure why they're in *sigh* nuget anyway.
[2014-05-19 13:38:14] jimevans: neither binary is something you'd establish a reference to in your .net project.
[2014-05-19 13:38:41] jimevans: and *sigh* nuget's whole raison d'etre is to be an "add reference dialog on steroids"
[2014-05-19 13:38:49] Mozleron: they've got three powershell scripts in there that seem to be having trouble executing in time for our build system to find them in time, so i think i need to dig down that path a bit further.
[2014-05-19 13:39:05] Mozleron: well, to find the .exe they are supposed to bring down.

[2014-05-19 15:10:49] jimevans: they replaced all occurrences of PRUnicode with char16_t.
[2014-05-19 15:10:54] jimevans: this is the bug in question https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927728
[2014-05-19 15:11:31] jimevans: so i'm not sure how to proceed exactly.
[2014-05-19 15:11:43] jimevans: we could #define a new type, and use that.
[2014-05-19 15:11:55] jleyba: typedef char16_t PRUnicode;

[2014-05-19 16:31:19] jimevans: eipieqng1: so there are a couple of scenarios that you might be trying to accomplish. you've not let us know which exactly. one is that you have a site that requires login, and you simply don't want to replicate the login process for every test. the other is that your tests aren't atomic (that is, they depend on each other), so you depend on certain user data structures being present to accomplish what you need.
