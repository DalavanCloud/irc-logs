[2014-05-04 09:51:11] pixelport: i have a problem

[2014-05-04 09:52:48] panda__: you like bad bitches?
[2014-05-04 09:52:53] panda__: haha jk
[2014-05-04 09:53:26] pixelport: I am running selenium webdriver with firefox on an windows vps. With multiple drivers. But after some time because the firefox windows are freezed.
[2014-05-04 09:53:41] panda__: sorry what's vps?
[2014-05-04 09:53:47] panda__: virtual machine?
[2014-05-04 09:53:50] pixelport: virtual private system
[2014-05-04 09:53:52] pixelport: windows server
[2014-05-04 09:54:00] panda__: is that like vmware or virtualbox?
[2014-05-04 09:54:19] pixelport: a little bit like that
[2014-05-04 09:54:45] panda__: when you say multiple drivers you mean multiple instances of webdriver?
[2014-05-04 09:54:51] pixelport: yes
[2014-05-04 09:55:01] acidpeak, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2014-05-04 09:55:06] panda__: hmmm
[2014-05-04 09:55:30] panda__: do they all need to be firefox? maybe make one safari, make one chrome?
[2014-05-04 09:55:42] pixelport: windows "clears" the ram of the firefox windows and then the webdriver connection is still working but it throws exceptions like element is not fount
[2014-05-04 09:55:45] pixelport: *found
[2014-05-04 09:55:53] panda__: weird
[2014-05-04 09:56:02] pixelport: Yeah maybe I could try that out
[2014-05-04 09:56:24] panda__: hmm so all the tests are running simultaneously? maybe you need to use Selenium-Grid
[2014-05-04 09:56:39] panda__: for better parallel operation
[2014-05-04 09:57:18] pixelport: When you open a window on windows which you havent open some time before. The window freezes for a little moment. Because the memory of that programm was saved to disk and no it needs to be restored.
[2014-05-04 09:57:35] panda__: oh I see
[2014-05-04 09:57:46] pixelport: Maybe there is a way to tell windows that the firefox process is important
[2014-05-04 09:58:00] pixelport: and that windows shoudn't do that
[2014-05-04 09:58:03] pixelport: ?
[2014-05-04 09:58:33] panda__: maybe you just need to slow down the speed of the test
[2014-05-04 09:58:49] panda__: to give the windows time to unfreeze and load
[2014-05-04 09:58:58] pixelport: no its not that
[2014-05-04 09:59:09] panda__: oh okay
[2014-05-04 09:59:26] pixelport: when I bring the firefox window to front again everything is working fine than
[2014-05-04 09:59:49] pixelport: so firefox seems to "cut off" the rendering of the page when the window was not used
[2014-05-04 10:00:07] pixelport: this might be the reason why selenium cant find elements
[2014-05-04 10:00:33] panda__: maybe add a click command to give it focus first
[2014-05-04 10:00:40] pixelport: interesting idea
[2014-05-04 10:01:24] pixelport: but how would I know which firefox window is linked to which webdriver instance?
[2014-05-04 10:02:11] panda__: i don't know, is there some way to keep track of the window id?
[2014-05-04 10:03:08] panda__: i'll check the command reference, i think there should be a way to do that
[2014-05-04 10:04:07] panda__: well there is definitely a windowID for the open command
[2014-05-04 10:04:17] panda__: there must be a way to store that in a variable
[2014-05-04 10:05:10] pixelport: hmm I also minimised the firefox windows
[2014-05-04 10:05:38] pixelport: maybe if I would keep them maximised windows wont clear memory
[2014-05-04 10:07:22] panda__: yeah that could work
