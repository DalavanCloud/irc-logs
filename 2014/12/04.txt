[2014-12-04 05:16:30] Dave_B_: ok that's not right
[2014-12-04 05:16:42] Dave_B_: you've put part of your selector outside your selector
[2014-12-04 05:17:14] Dave_B_: By.cssSelector("div[class^='serp-adv__block serp-adv__block_premium_yes serp-adv__block_istwo_yes']/div[2]/div/div")
[2014-12-04 05:17:28] Dave_B_: ooops that was asked ages ago!
[2014-12-04 05:17:43] Dave_B_: in general I'd try to avoid paths like that^^ though as they'll be fragile to change
[2014-12-04 05:18:29] Dave_B_: if there is anything identifiable about the final div then you could skip levels, e.g…..
[2014-12-04 05:18:52] Dave_B_: By.cssSelector("div[class^='serp-adv__block serp-adv__block_premium_yes serp-adv__block_istwo_yes'] div[something='unique bit']")
[2014-12-04 05:19:12] Dave_B_: so it still must be a child of the serp-adv_block thingie whatever that is
[2014-12-04 05:20:03] Dave_B_: or you could do subsequent lookups from a parent element, so you get the parent by the lookup you already used, then do parent.findElement(By.css… blah

[2014-12-04 12:45:43] HenriettaSalt_: Question about select forms (with Python): I'm trying to iterate through all options in a select dropdown form. Right now, my python code successfully opens the modal with the form in it and clicks the dropdown. Then, it finds the first form option by xpath and I call .click() on it. It doesn't click though; the dropdown remains down and the option *is* selected, but it's not
[2014-12-04 12:45:43] HenriettaSalt_: really clicked.... Any ideas?
[2014-12-04 12:46:45] lukeis: you shouldn't click on the dropdown first, just click directly on the option
