[2014-12-16 01:59:18] Joe___: is it possible to change HTML code of loaded page?
[2014-12-16 01:59:43] Joe___: in selenium webdriver
[2014-12-16 01:59:44] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: I guess you could if you injected javascript
[2014-12-16 01:59:54] WhereIsMySpoon: that mutated the dom
[2014-12-16 02:00:09] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: what language?
[2014-12-16 02:00:18] Joe___: java
[2014-12-16 02:00:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: look at JavascriptExecutor class
[2014-12-16 02:00:33] WhereIsMySpoon: it can send javascript to the browser
[2014-12-16 02:00:50] WhereIsMySpoon: you can then use this to add/remove dom nodes as you normally would with js
[2014-12-16 02:01:38] Joe___: Ok. But before I don't did it. Go to read about it.. Thanks.

[2014-12-16 03:04:17] WhereIsMySpoon: just a straightforward question
[2014-12-16 03:05:07] Joe___: I'm  beginner.
[2014-12-16 03:05:42] WhereIsMySpoon: Ok
[2014-12-16 03:06:19] WhereIsMySpoon: and how did you know to import all the current stuff you have?
[2014-12-16 03:06:33] WhereIsMySpoon: you must have imported WebDriver at least
[2014-12-16 03:06:39] WhereIsMySpoon: and presumably some other stuff

[2014-12-16 03:10:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-12-16 03:10:38] WhereIsMySpoon: -sigh-
[2014-12-16 03:10:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: do you know what importing actually means/does?
[2014-12-16 03:10:56] WhereIsMySpoon: and why it's needed?
[2014-12-16 03:11:21] Joe___: I think it add additional library into my code.
[2014-12-16 03:12:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Ok so that's not quite correct - you already have the selenium jar added to your project. What importing does is tell the compiler where to go and look for the class you're trying to use. That's why when you don't have it there, it says "No such class exists"
[2014-12-16 03:12:51] WhereIsMySpoon: it's like directions for the compiler
[2014-12-16 03:13:16] Joe___: MMmm... I think I understand what you mean.
[2014-12-16 03:13:51] Joe___: But where I can get JavascriptExecutor library? Just seek in Google?
[2014-12-16 03:13:58] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: no, it's in the selenium jar
[2014-12-16 03:14:02] WhereIsMySpoon: just import it
[2014-12-16 03:14:14] WhereIsMySpoon: it's just a class in the jar
[2014-12-16 03:14:27] WhereIsMySpoon: all you need to do is add the import so that the compiler knows where to look for it :)
[2014-12-16 03:14:32] Joe___: By build path?
[2014-12-16 03:14:46] WhereIsMySpoon: no, in the same place as all the other imports in your java file
[2014-12-16 03:14:54] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: are you using eclipse?
[2014-12-16 03:15:05] Joe___: Yes, eclipse.
[2014-12-16 03:15:14] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: press ctrl-shift-o
[2014-12-16 03:15:31] WhereIsMySpoon: it is a shortcut that will import all your missing classes and remove any unneeded imports
[2014-12-16 03:15:48] WhereIsMySpoon: if there are multiple classes with the same name it will come with a menu where you can pick the one you want
[2014-12-16 03:16:12] Joe___: Wow.. error is gone :)
[2014-12-16 03:16:30] Joe___: Thank you
[2014-12-16 03:17:01] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe___: i really think it would benefit you to go through some java programming tutorials
[2014-12-16 03:17:36] WhereIsMySpoon: learning to code by hacking at stuff is valuable but it's also good to know some theory and understand how stuff works

[2014-12-16 03:27:51] twinings: WhereIsMySpoon:  what are the pros and cons?    is css easier or more difficult, or it's approximately the same in that regard?

[2014-12-16 03:29:03] WhereIsMySpoon: twinings: there are a few reasons. One of the reasons is that the implementation of the xpath selector is different for each browser, and IE doesnt have one at all, meaning that one had to be invented for it
[2014-12-16 03:29:35] WhereIsMySpoon: twinings: secondly, xpath leads itself to more brittle selectors as it is more traversal than specific lookup
[2014-12-16 03:29:48] WhereIsMySpoon: twinings: thirdly, I'm pretty sure that finding by xpath is slower than by css
[2014-12-16 03:30:58] twinings: ok
[2014-12-16 03:31:07] WhereIsMySpoon: however xpath is still the only way to search by text
[2014-12-16 03:31:16] WhereIsMySpoon: so if you need to do that, you use xpath
[2014-12-16 03:31:42] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise try to use id, name, class or css
[2014-12-16 03:31:54] WhereIsMySpoon: for specific selectors
[2014-12-16 03:32:06] WhereIsMySpoon: id is the best to use ofc :)
[2014-12-16 03:32:09] WhereIsMySpoon: if you can
[2014-12-16 03:33:21] twinings: if you are testing a webpage, which makes more sense, to see there is text "this is some text", or to see that the text is within a very very specific location.    would you try to construct this with an "id", for example.
[2014-12-16 03:34:38] WhereIsMySpoon: if you can it's best to target it with an id, say if it's in a <p> element, have <p id="mySalesText>some text here about sales</p>
[2014-12-16 03:34:48] WhereIsMySpoon: er, missing a quote
[2014-12-16 03:34:51] WhereIsMySpoon: but you get the idea
[2014-12-16 03:37:23] twinings: in the selenium IDE, if targetting <p id="mySalesText> , what would the target be?  literally  id="mySalesText"?      would you put css= ?
[2014-12-16 03:37:37] WhereIsMySpoon: oh you're using the ide
[2014-12-16 03:37:38] WhereIsMySpoon: dont

[2014-12-16 03:38:25] WhereIsMySpoon: if you -really- want to use an ide-type thing for making selenium tests, try out Selenium Builder
[2014-12-16 03:38:32] WhereIsMySpoon: its the successor
[2014-12-16 03:38:38] WhereIsMySpoon: but id suggest coding your tests
[2014-12-16 03:40:03] twinings: if I go to Export Test Case As... maybe that's a way to get started with coding
[2014-12-16 03:40:16] twinings: which is better. there are 13 choices.
[2014-12-16 03:40:17] Dave_B_1: also, if you want to use CSS then http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp is a useful reference - it'll tell you for instance that you could have found your previous one with '#mySalesText' as your css selector
[2014-12-16 03:40:50] Dave_B_1: (though by.id is fine too to be honest)
[2014-12-16 03:41:57] twinings: I will try exporting it to Ruby.

[2014-12-16 03:43:04] Dave_B_1: :p
[2014-12-16 03:43:12] WhereIsMySpoon: twinings: make sure you export it as webdriver code
[2014-12-16 03:43:15] WhereIsMySpoon: and not RC
[2014-12-16 03:45:44] Dave_B_1: if you've already started learning java then perhaps export it as java if it has that option? It's a well supported & used language binding.

For example:  you have a few tests that pass, but it won't catch a funky image, which looks wrong now because it's been replaced, or something.

[2014-12-16 05:59:35] mixxit: i believe the element is failing after logging in via https
[2014-12-16 05:59:47] mixxit: so its probably not being bale to load the https login page
[2014-12-16 05:59:59] mixxit: but what i dont get is why it would work fine on fiddler
[2014-12-16 06:05:02] ratem: phantomjs works with https
[2014-12-16 06:05:29] ratem: no idea for credentials etc. but pure https works
[2014-12-16 06:06:27] ratem: you could print out the current pageSource after you logged in too see the current DOM
