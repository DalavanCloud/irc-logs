[2014-12-03 06:10:45] pyGalNewb3: Good morning, I am a CSC student in need of some help understanding what is going on, and wrong, with my selenium test.
[2014-12-03 06:10:50] pyGalNewb3: This is for a project.
[2014-12-03 06:10:53] pyGalNewb3: at school
[2014-12-03 06:11:40] pyGalNewb3: anyone have issues with not having the get() actually getting past a login screen?
[2014-12-03 06:12:10] pyGalNewb3: Or understand how to fix the problem?
[2014-12-03 06:14:57] pyGalNewb3: I am using Selenium Firefox webdriver and the django LiveServerTestCase, which are both pretty cool tools.  They are just kind of confusing, especially when trying to distinguish between different packages in the docs.
[2014-12-03 06:15:38] pyGalNewb3: I am not sure I am using the correct logic for the driver and test subclass I am using, or more importantly how they work.
[2014-12-03 06:21:10] apollo13: pyGalNewb3: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/tests.py#L104-L116 shows you how you'd login into the admin for instance
[2014-12-03 06:23:28] pyGalNewb3: Thank you apollo13.  I can log in successfully, and it doesn't do this for every page for some reason, but instead of going to for instance, "http://localhost:2800/side_app1pg" like it is supposed to after the login screen, it always goes to "http://localhost:2800/admin/?next=side_app1pg/" which does not exist.
[2014-12-03 06:24:48] losh, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 06:25:15] pyGalNewb3: sorry above I meant in the last url, instead of going from "http://localhost:2800/accounts/login" to "http://localhost:2800/side_app1pg", it goes to "http://localhost:2800/accounts/login/?next=side_apppg1"
[2014-12-03 06:25:19] pyGalNewb3: which does not exist
[2014-12-03 06:26:06] bimmelino, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 06:26:12] pyGalNewb3: Also, part of the complexity of the siutation is the first time I run it in the Selenium Firefox IDE, it works, that is where I get the test from.
[2014-12-03 06:26:56] pyGalNewb3: Its trying to run it again or as an exported Webdriver test that it breaks down.
[2014-12-03 06:27:52] apollo13: no idea, never used the IDE
[2014-12-03 06:28:13] apollo13: but your redirect suggests that the login failed

[2014-12-03 06:39:52] cgoldberg: Firefox 34 came out yesterday.. Are there any known issues with selenium 2.44, or should I pull the trigger and upgrade my CI machines to FF 34?
[2014-12-03 06:42:19] pyGalNewb3: apollo13 thanks for the link but unfortunly the problem is not really described there at all, the same login works for other tests, including a specific login test, it just doesn't ever go to that side_app1pg url when called with get
[2014-12-03 06:42:43] pyGalNewb3: it always appends the "?next=new_url_to_get" to the end of the "/accounts/login" url
[2014-12-03 06:44:25] nirvdrum, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-12-03 06:47:21] pyGalNewb3: I also tried just leaving out the login part of the test completly and just going directly to the side_app1pg url directly with get() but that did not work either.
[2014-12-03 06:47:27] pyGalNewb3: Same issues.
[2014-12-03 06:51:38] apollo13: sure, cause you need a login there, as such it redirects you…
[2014-12-03 06:52:37] pyGalNewb3: any ideas what the appended "?next=url_I_want_now" is about when the get is called after the login attempt?
[2014-12-03 06:53:13] Dave_B_: so the site has redirected you back to login, with a url parameter so it knows where to take you if you successfully log in
[2014-12-03 06:53:58] pyGalNewb3: Even if the testLogin(self) worked before running the test that gets the new url?
[2014-12-03 06:54:12] antsanto, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 06:54:37] Dave_B_: if it's a new browser session then that login token (i've no idea how your site manages it's sessions btw, just making up words :p) will not be valid for the later test
[2014-12-03 06:55:05] apollo13: pyGalNewb3: you have to do it in the __same__ test
[2014-12-03 06:55:35] pyGalNewb3: thank you, I have been calling the testLogin() from inside the new one and even tried just putting the login in the testclass setup()
[2014-12-03 06:55:48] apollo13: well that would also work
[2014-12-03 06:56:07] pyGalNewb3: unfortunatley, when I ran the test I got the same problem then as well
[2014-12-03 06:56:21] apollo13: well, without you showing code etc it's just guesswork…
[2014-12-03 06:56:57] Dave_B_: can you get to the url you expect manually typing it into the address bar after logging in?
[2014-12-03 06:56:57] pyGalNewb3: I can do that, I don't really know where to post it though.  I have never used this before.

[2014-12-03 06:57:49] pyGalNewb3: I have tried manually outside of the test and can successfully get to the url.
[2014-12-03 06:57:56] pyGalNewb3: from the login page.
[2014-12-03 06:57:59] apollo13: *sigh*

[2014-12-03 06:58:31] Dave_B_: pythdasch: It doesn't move your physical mouse around so can't help you there :(
[2014-12-03 06:59:10] pythdasch: So its impossible ? maybe showing something to see where he clicks ??

[2014-12-03 07:00:27] Dave_B_: you could e.g. add to the dom, to make a red box around the element that is going to get clicked if you really want
[2014-12-03 07:00:33] Dave_B_: not sure why you'd want to though
[2014-12-03 07:00:43] pyGalNewb3: pythdasch, it usually at least highlight selections with the mouse while running the tests

[2014-12-03 07:01:56] Dave_B_: I'd just record the video then add in markings afterwards personally
[2014-12-03 07:02:14] Dave_B_: get it to output a log of where it's clicking and times, make it easy
[2014-12-03 07:02:47] pythdasch: Y but if I can do it without editing the video would be soooo great :p
[2014-12-03 07:02:50] pyGalNewb3: I would go with the last suggestion given, even if you are going to also do a visual later, to keep track and be sure.
[2014-12-03 07:03:20] pythdasch: Dave_B_, what do u mean about output a log ?
[2014-12-03 07:03:59] antsanto: Hi all, if I can click using javascriptexecutor, but click method doesn't work. What might be reason?
[2014-12-03 07:04:16] antsanto: Click method I meant from WD api
[2014-12-03 07:04:50] pyGalNewb3: Sorry to interrupt, but on the side, I am still trying to figure out the whole url redirect/login issue and was wondering if anyone knew of a reason for a login to work once but not a second time between tests?

[2014-12-03 07:17:02] Dave_B_: pythdasch: you could console.log or something information about each element that is getting clicked, so you've a record of what happened

[2014-12-03 08:19:30] cgoldberg: pythdasch, why?
[2014-12-03 08:19:38] pythdasch: My boss asked me to
[2014-12-03 08:19:52] cgoldberg: it doesn't use the mouse.. why do you want to show something that doesn't even happen under test
[2014-12-03 08:20:03] jimevans: selenium doesn't actually move the mouse pointer when automating mouse actions.
[2014-12-03 08:20:20] pythdasch: I know but I'm searching how to
[2014-12-03 08:20:33] cgoldberg: pythdasch, but why.. you are demoing something fake then
[2014-12-03 08:20:44] pythdasch: what ?
[2014-12-03 08:21:12] jimevans: pythdasch: are your video tutorials on using selenium, or are they on using your website?

[2014-12-03 08:23:17] jimevans: i'm not sure why one would want to use a recording of selenium automating a website for a demonstration or tutorial of how to use that website. you'd be far better off doing a screencast recording of manually performing the steps.
[2014-12-03 08:23:19] cgoldberg: pythdasch, move your mouse pointer.. with your mouse... and record that.  what does demoing your website even  have to do with selenium?
[2014-12-03 08:23:35] pythdasch: lol
[2014-12-03 08:23:42] pythdasch: I know but it's my task
[2014-12-03 08:23:58] pythdasch: I already said it
[2014-12-03 08:24:19] jimevans: then your response to your boss is "no, selenium isn't suitable for this task"
[2014-12-03 08:24:22] cgoldberg: pythdasch, blindly following tasks is a career limiting move
[2014-12-03 08:24:42] pythdasch: It's also interesting I never used selenium before
[2014-12-03 08:24:57] jimevans: if, in fact, the task is "investigate whether we should use selenium in creating these tutorial videos"
[2014-12-03 08:25:06] pythdasch: I'm ok with you but I just was engage 1 week ago
[2014-12-03 08:25:07] cgoldberg: pythdasch, selenium is *not* the right tool for doing a website demo video recording... by a longshot

[2014-12-03 08:29:27] jimevans: pythdasch: if i'm hearing you correctly, your boss asked you to investigate whether you can use selenium to create these videos. is that accurate?
[2014-12-03 08:29:36] pythdasch: For this I already found a solution : time.sleep()
[2014-12-03 08:29:51] pythdasch: exactly jimevans
[2014-12-03 08:30:00] cgoldberg: pythdasch, another hack,... you are using the wrong tool for the job
[2014-12-03 08:30:06] pythdasch: I just need the mouse cursor and it would be great
[2014-12-03 08:30:09] cgoldberg: tell your boss selnium is not the right tool for this
[2014-12-03 08:30:31] jimevans: okay, so the answer is "no, selenium can't be used for this, at least not effectively." mainly because selenium doesn't actually move the mouse cursor, which is one of the main requirements for your task.
[2014-12-03 08:30:46] cgoldberg: pythdasch, why do you want the demo to be automated anyway?
[2014-12-03 08:30:47] jimevans: not only doesn't it do so, but it can't be made to do so.
[2014-12-03 08:31:08] pythdasch: I love the fact everyone criticize my goal :D
[2014-12-03 08:31:19] jimevans: no, i'm not criticizing your goal at all.
[2014-12-03 08:31:39] cgoldberg: pythdasch, why do you love that?  we are giving you honest advice and you are treating it as a joke and plowing forward
[2014-12-03 08:31:43] jimevans: i'm simply saying that your asking for a feature that doesn't (and won't) exist in selenium.
[2014-12-03 08:31:45] pythdasch: It's why I will probably have to make the cursor on my own
[2014-12-03 08:32:24] jimevans: okay, so consider that if you do that, you'll likely have some conflicting animations in the website being automated.
[2014-12-03 08:32:51] pythdasch: cgoldberg, Because I already said that it was a research and a task to know if it's possible and I have 3 days to explore all the possibilities with selenium webdriver
[2014-12-03 08:33:23] cgoldberg: pythdasch, well day 1 you found out it's not going to work... now you have 2 days to relax
[2014-12-03 08:33:36] pythdasch: And I already said it to my boss and it doesn't help me in the way I can achieve that goal
[2014-12-03 08:33:57] pythdasch: I'm doing well cgoldberg I finished all the automated video
[2014-12-03 08:34:08] pythdasch: I just need to make it more friendly
[2014-12-03 08:34:21] jimevans: i'm sure it's possible, if you use an external library (or more likely OS API calls) to physically move the cursor around, but if the site changes, and you need to redo the video, your code will likely be a challenge to maintain.
[2014-12-03 08:34:44] jimevans: consider this scenario.
[2014-12-03 08:35:04] jimevans: you have a hover-menu that drops down and you want to click on an item in the menu.
[2014-12-03 08:35:18] jimevans: you use the webdriver action chains to automate that.
[2014-12-03 08:35:27] pythdasch: Y it would be very hard to do
[2014-12-03 08:35:39] jimevans: then you use your mouse cursor movement library to move the mouse cursor to where it should be.
[2014-12-03 08:35:59] cgoldberg: pythdasch, rethink why you'd want to automate a video tutorial in the first place
[2014-12-03 08:36:02] jimevans: which will retrigger the dropdown automation again, making the menu "flicker", and being an inaccurate representation of what the user would see.
[2014-12-03 08:36:13] jimevans: so that's one issue.
[2014-12-03 08:36:44] jimevans: now consider that you need to update the video because of a site redesign.
[2014-12-03 08:36:50] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 805
[2014-12-03 08:37:17] jimevans: your webdriver code might still work, if the identifiers for the elements haven't changed, but you'll need to update all your mouse cursor movement code so that the mouse cursor appears to move to the right place.
[2014-12-03 08:37:18] pythdasch: cgoldberg, I don't want to think about it, I already speak about that with my boss and that's it. Stop saying everytime that's not possible and everything. Everything is possible
[2014-12-03 08:37:32] pythdasch: Y jimevans
[2014-12-03 08:37:50] pythdasch: But for the moment I don't think we will do it
[2014-12-03 08:37:55] jimevans: why what?
[2014-12-03 08:37:57] Dave_B_: you could maybe use the webelement locations with an offset for the browser frame, provided you always run fullscreen in the same browser and it's design doesn't cause the frame to change size
[2014-12-03 08:38:21] Dave_B_: terrible idea, but theoretically… :p
[2014-12-03 08:38:27] pythdasch: :p
[2014-12-03 08:38:31] pythdasch: I think so too
[2014-12-03 08:38:54] cgoldberg: pythdasch, you are an annoying fool.  I've wasted too much time on this discussion
[2014-12-03 08:38:55] jimevans: pythdasch: note that i'm categorically *not* saying it's impossible. just that it introduces complexity into a relatively simple task ("recording a tutorial video")
[2014-12-03 08:38:57] pythdasch: it's difficult because I will have to add voice on the video
[2014-12-03 08:39:25] pythdasch: I agree with you jimevans
[2014-12-03 08:39:27] jimevans: pythdasch: oh, but that's easy.
[2014-12-03 08:39:47] pythdasch: (With my automated video)
[2014-12-03 08:39:56] jimevans: as someone with a modicum of video and audio production background, muxing audio and video is very, very easy.
[2014-12-03 08:40:05] jimevans: with proper editing tools, of course.
[2014-12-03 08:40:08] pythdasch: For the moment I use vlc to record screen
[2014-12-03 08:40:30] pythdasch: If it interest you I can show you the code

[2014-12-03 08:41:42] jimevans: no, i'm honestly not *that* interested in the project. i wouldn't use webdriver for this. i'd capture the operations done manually, add the voice-over later, and call it done.
[2014-12-03 08:42:04] pythdasch: jimevans, :)
[2014-12-03 08:42:07] jimevans: again, i'm not saying you couldn't do it. it just seems like a lot of additional effort for something relatively simple.
[2014-12-03 08:42:15] cgoldberg: i'd turn on a screen recorder.. capture audio and video at the same time.. and call it done
[2014-12-03 08:42:35] cgoldberg: tbh, there is no programming or tooling needed
[2014-12-03 08:42:48] jimevans: cgoldberg: depending on the level of professionalism you want, i'd almost certainly *not* record audio and video at the same time.
[2014-12-03 08:43:08] pythdasch: The main advantage for automating videos is that you can generate video with the same browser as the watcher
[2014-12-03 08:43:38] cgoldberg: jimevans, perhaps... my screencasts I do.... so you can sync what your doing with how long you need to speak.

[2014-12-03 08:44:22] jimevans: cgoldberg: but timing audio after the fact is *so* ridiculously easy. or do a scratch audio track for later replacement.
[2014-12-03 08:44:26] Dave_B_: though the person clicking needs to know when to move on to next step i guess
[2014-12-03 08:44:29] cgoldberg: what does " generate video with the same browser as the watcher" mean?

[2014-12-03 08:45:23] cgoldberg: btw, I love OpenShot for video editing
[2014-12-03 08:45:33] jimevans: just my opinion, but if your content looks *that* much different between different browsers, you've got bigger problems than having the video use the same browser as the viewer. :)
[2014-12-03 08:45:33] pythdasch: it means that it could reproduce the same browser in the video than the person who watch the video. Like Firefox or Chrome or IE

[2014-12-03 08:46:03] pythdasch: I hope not
[2014-12-03 08:46:41] jimevans: and if your users are *so* unsophisticated that they can't understand that operations on a site browsed in one browser are the same as the same site browsed in another browser, then you're again focusing on the wrong problem.
[2014-12-03 08:46:43] jimevans: :)
[2014-12-03 08:46:50] pythdasch: After it could be interesting if I manage to do this ^^
[2014-12-03 08:46:58] jimevans: it's rearranging deck chairs on the titanic.
[2014-12-03 08:47:50] pythdasch: Don't know exactly why he asked me to do this ^^
[2014-12-03 08:48:59] jimevans: generating the same tutorial video in chrome and again in firefox and again in IE and again in safari, just so the user can watch the same operations performed in whatever browser they're using to browse the site seems so wasteful to me that i can't even begin to think about how to discuss it rationally.

[2014-12-03 08:51:58] *jimevans hides'
[2014-12-03 08:52:13] Cow_woC: :)
[2014-12-03 08:52:23] jimevans: Cow_woC: what do you need?
[2014-12-03 08:52:35] tony5, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2014-12-03 08:52:40] cgoldberg: jimevans, social chat is fine... but discussion about  purposely wasteful projects  is another matter
[2014-12-03 08:52:51] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 08:52:53] Cow_woC: jimevans: I'm looking for a direct answer: is Chromedriver dead for all intensive purposes? Is Firefoxdriver any better?
[2014-12-03 08:53:24] jimevans: Cow_woC: to answer your questions, "no," and "i don't know what you mean"
[2014-12-03 08:53:32] Cow_woC: Okay, I'll elaborate.
[2014-12-03 08:53:35] sebhoss, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 08:53:37] jimevans: please do
[2014-12-03 08:53:47] cgoldberg: s/intensive/intents and/
[2014-12-03 08:53:53] cgoldberg: :)
[2014-12-03 08:54:06] jimevans: cgoldberg: yeah, that's a pet peeve of mine too, but i've given up on it. :)
[2014-12-03 08:54:12] cgoldberg: lol
[2014-12-03 08:54:29] cgoldberg: irregardless... please continue
[2014-12-03 08:54:37] barancev: btw, there were two chromedriver releases in the last two months, so it is definetely not dead
[2014-12-03 08:54:56] Cow_woC: I've been trying to use Chromedriver for the past month. I've run into major bugs like  https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=987 and https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=484. I've tried to contact the author on the mailing list, issue tracker, and even IRC to no end.
[2014-12-03 08:55:05] Cow_woC: barancev: Hi :)
[2014-12-03 08:55:21] cgoldberg: see y'all later...
[2014-12-03 08:55:23] Cow_woC: barancev: I know there are releases, but they seem to be focusing on bugs that are reported by Google's own staff.
[2014-12-03 08:55:24] cgoldberg, quitting. (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[2014-12-03 08:55:40] barancev: yes, they are slow to fix bugs. because... I don't know why :)
[2014-12-03 08:55:45] Cow_woC: And fixes are very very slow moving
[2014-12-03 08:56:20] Cow_woC: Right... I think they don't really dedicate many resources to this project. It's 1 guy working on it, and I'm not even sure he's full-time on this.
[2014-12-03 08:56:59] Cow_woC: In any case, in light of the aforementioned bugs I'm asking for advice. Is FirefoxDriver any more stable? Are there alternatives for using Chrome through Selenium?
[2014-12-03 08:57:16] Cow_woC: My focus is on stability. Performance is a distant second.
[2014-12-03 08:57:34] barancev: there are long-living bugs in FirefoxDriver too :)
[2014-12-03 08:57:46] Cow_woC: barancev: Are any of them major?
[2014-12-03 08:57:52] jimevans: Cow_woC: the manufacturer of the chrome browser is the owner of the chromedriver component. this will eventually (soon?) be the case with the firefox driver also.
[2014-12-03 08:58:19] Cow_woC: barancev: I mean, I'm familiar with https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=95 (long-lived feature request) but it's not the same as basic functionality not working.
[2014-12-03 08:58:39] Cow_woC: jimevans: That's unfortunate (about Firefox).
[2014-12-03 08:58:54] Cow_woC: Do you have any advice for me?
[2014-12-03 08:59:29] barancev: Cow_woC: ChromeDriver passes 728 tests of the selenium test suite, FirefoxDriver passes 814 tests
[2014-12-03 08:59:44] sebhoss, quitting. ()
[2014-12-03 08:59:45] barancev: make a decision yourself :)
[2014-12-03 08:59:48] Cow_woC: :)
[2014-12-03 09:00:08] jimevans: well, considering most of the googlers who would have any input on the chrome driver are based on the US west coast, you could hang around for a bit and see if any of them pop into the channel.
[2014-12-03 09:00:15] Cow_woC: barancev: does opening new tabs (sending CTRL+T) work under FirefoxDriver?
[2014-12-03 09:00:20] jimevans: because it's a bit early to expect them in now.
[2014-12-03 09:00:32] Cow_woC: jimevans: what names should I look out for?
[2014-12-03 09:00:39] barancev: tabs are not supported
[2014-12-03 09:00:44] jimevans: oh dear $deity. why, oh why, oh WHY does everyone insist on being able to manipulate new tabs?
[2014-12-03 09:00:52] Cow_woC: barancev: I know. But sending keys is.
[2014-12-03 09:01:00] barancev: so don't send
[2014-12-03 09:01:26] Cow_woC: barancev: ...? I don't understand. Selenium is supposed to support sending keys. That's a supported feature. So why would I not send?
[2014-12-03 09:01:51] barancev: because if you do you'll not be able to switch to the opened tab
[2014-12-03 09:01:55] Cow_woC: I understand that there is no portable way to interact with tabs. But portability is not a concern for my project. I am only working with one browser and that won't be changing in the future.
[2014-12-03 09:02:03] barancev: so what's the purpose to open it?
[2014-12-03 09:02:15] jimevans: Cow_woC: certain keystroke sequences, particularly those that interact with the browser "chrome" may not be fully supported.
[2014-12-03 09:02:32] Cow_woC: barancev: Under Chrome I CTRL+SHIFT+click on link and this opens a new tab and shifts focus to it... so there are no focus problems. I assume I can find a similar shortcut under Firefox.
[2014-12-03 09:02:36] jimevans: yes, there's a generic "send keys to the browser" command, but as with everything, there are limits to what it can do.
[2014-12-03 09:02:49] barancev: what's the purpose?
[2014-12-03 09:02:59] barancev: why do you need tabs so much?
[2014-12-03 09:03:00] jimevans: biab
[2014-12-03 09:03:16] Cow_woC: jimevans: That's okay. The problem is that ChromeDriver broke Keys.chord() so you can't really send anything meaningful.
[2014-12-03 09:03:27] Cow_woC: barancev: It's mostly for debugging reasons.
[2014-12-03 09:03:37] barancev: debugging what?
[2014-12-03 09:04:15] Cow_woC: barancev: I keep track of my application state by having tab1 open links into tab2 ... tab2 into tab3 and so on.. When the task in tab3 finishes, it closes the tab and resumes operates in tab2. And so on. The app processes a website in a hierarchical manner.
[2014-12-03 09:04:34] Cow_woC: barancev: When I said "debugging" I simply meant it's easier for me to visualize what is going on and debug if anything goes wrong.
[2014-12-03 09:04:35] barancev: open in new windows
[2014-12-03 09:04:53] Cow_woC: barancev: I can do that, but it's harder to keep track of what window opened what other window.
[2014-12-03 09:05:10] Cow_woC: From a maintainability point of view, tabs are a lot more convenient.
[2014-12-03 09:06:06] Cow_woC: There is also one other huge advantage...
[2014-12-03 09:06:32] Cow_woC: I need to be able to shut down a browser session and resume it later. With tabs I can close the window and re-open it. With multiple windows I can't do this sort of resuming.
[2014-12-03 09:06:51] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 806
[2014-12-03 09:07:11] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-12-03 09:07:39] barancev: you can close some windows
[2014-12-03 09:07:52] errant_rider, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:07:58] errant_rider: hope everyone had a fine thanksgiving
[2014-12-03 09:08:05] Cow_woC: barancev: How would I shut down the entire browser (all windows) and reopen it at a later time without losing any of the windows?
[2014-12-03 09:08:10] barancev: alse, selenium does not support "resuming a session"
[2014-12-03 09:08:15] Cow_woC: errant_rider: 'elo :)
[2014-12-03 09:08:18] errant_rider: Cow_woC: you mean you want to reproduce a "crashed" browser?
[2014-12-03 09:08:19] barancev: neither it can connect to already runing session
[2014-12-03 09:08:38] Cow_woC: errant_rider: No. I am running a long-running task. I want to able to pause it and resume at a later time.
[2014-12-03 09:08:58] errant_rider: i don't think you'd be able to do that without reloading the pages...
[2014-12-03 09:09:01] errant_rider: can you do it manually now?
[2014-12-03 09:09:02] Cow_woC: barancev: Right, so my entire use-case is unsupported. So you can excuse me for resorting to the use of tabs :)
[2014-12-03 09:09:20] errant_rider: :log
[2014-12-03 09:09:21] selbot2: https://raw.github.com/SeleniumHQ/irc-logs/master/2014/12/03.txt
[2014-12-03 09:09:37] barancev: yes, your use case is not supported entirely, not only tabs :)
[2014-12-03 09:09:46] Cow_woC: errant_rider: Yes, as I explained to barancev: the advantage of using tabs is I can open 4-5 of them.... shut down the entire browser ... then when I reopen it the tabs gets restored in one shot. If I were using separate windows this wouldn't be possible.
[2014-12-03 09:10:02] barancev: btw, tabs support is expected to be implemented in marionette
[2014-12-03 09:10:11] errant_rider: do you reference all the tabs with one driver session?
[2014-12-03 09:10:20] errant_rider: why not just have 4-5 drivers, one for each window?
[2014-12-03 09:10:25] barancev: as windows (like in chromedriver)
[2014-12-03 09:10:49] Cow_woC: barancev: And BTW, this is even more relevant for another reason: when you resume a browser session the Referer header is kept for some browsers. If you manually a new browser and navigate directly to the URL you left off at you lose the Referer header.
[2014-12-03 09:10:51] errant_rider: cow: your scenario doesn't sound realistic…if i open chrome, close the browser, and reopen it, the page I was on doesn't automatically reappear...
[2014-12-03 09:10:56] barancev: "If I were using separate windows this wouldn't be possible" -- why not?
[2014-12-03 09:11:38] Cow_woC: barancev: Because (as far as I know) there is no way for me to close the entire browser (spanning multiple windows, not tabs) and have those same windows reopen if I relaunch the browser.
[2014-12-03 09:11:59] Cow_woC: errant_rider: It does if you have "restore session on startup" configured.
[2014-12-03 09:12:41] Cow_woC: errant_rider: Correction... they call this feature "On startup -> Continue where I left off"
[2014-12-03 09:12:50] errant_rider: can you configure that via the driver config currently?
[2014-12-03 09:12:52] Cow_woC: errant_rider: But anyway, it works fine.
[2014-12-03 09:13:07] errant_rider: so you are able to restore the windows?  then whats the issue?
[2014-12-03 09:13:09] errant_rider:  very confused
[2014-12-03 09:13:10] Cow_woC: errant_rider: No. I configure a browser profile, and tell Selenium to use that profile on startup.
[2014-12-03 09:13:20] errant_rider: barancev you're in Ukraine right?
[2014-12-03 09:13:29] Cow_woC: errant_rider: This only works for tabs, not windows.
[2014-12-03 09:14:03] Cow_woC: errant_rider: Okay, I should clarify.... if I had a way to close all windows at once (something you can simulate using a mouse under Windows, I think) then yes this would probably work as well without tabs.
[2014-12-03 09:14:12] barancev: errant_rider: Russia
[2014-12-03 09:14:18] Cow_woC: errant_rider: But as far as I'm aware, there is no way to do this using Chromedriver.
[2014-12-03 09:14:21] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:14:29] Cow_woC: errant_rider: The only way to implement this using Chromedriver is to use tabs.
[2014-12-03 09:14:45] pyGalNewb3, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2014-12-03 09:15:11] Cow_woC: errant_rider: Chromedriver has a host of problems which (together) are causing this problem. For example, Webdriver.quit() kills the process instead of shutting down the browser gracefully.
[2014-12-03 09:15:14] barancev: Cow_woC: when you do automation you mostly care about isolation of your tests
[2014-12-03 09:15:16] barancev: that'
[2014-12-03 09:15:39] Cow_woC: barancev: True. But I'm not using it for automated testing. I'm using it for web crawling.
[2014-12-03 09:15:40] barancev: that's why your use case is out of the mainstream
[2014-12-03 09:15:47] Cow_woC: barancev: True.
[2014-12-03 09:15:50] barancev: I guessed
[2014-12-03 09:16:03] errant_rider: have you considered close() instead of quit()?
[2014-12-03 09:16:06] barancev: don't use selenium for crawling
[2014-12-03 09:16:08] Cow_woC: But you are probably aware this is a very very popular use-case for selenium :)
[2014-12-03 09:16:23] errant_rider: i've never used it for that
[2014-12-03 09:16:28] errant_rider: why are you web crawling, and for what?
[2014-12-03 09:16:30] barancev: it is popular, but don't use it
[2014-12-03 09:16:30] Cow_woC: errant_rider: close() will close one window/tab at a time and as I stated I'm trying to close/restore all windows/tabs in one shot.

[2014-12-03 09:16:47] errant_rider: Cow_woC: yep, that's unsupported.
[2014-12-03 09:16:51] errant_rider:  patches welcome though!
[2014-12-03 09:16:59] lukeis: heh
[2014-12-03 09:17:10] lukeis: not really a patch sort of thing there...
[2014-12-03 09:17:19] Cow_woC: Well, first off: why is there resistance to supporting tabs when it's in such high demand?
[2014-12-03 09:17:24] barancev: if it is your site -- why do you need crawling? if it is not your site, you most probably break rules (terms of use)
[2014-12-03 09:17:32] barancev: and selenium is SLOW
[2014-12-03 09:17:34] lukeis: a tab and a window are effectively the same thing
[2014-12-03 09:17:40] Cow_woC: barancev: I'm not in a rush.
[2014-12-03 09:17:49] barancev: use http-level tools, or better -- API
[2014-12-03 09:18:04] errant_rider: why aren't you using curl requests?
[2014-12-03 09:18:06] Ardesco, quitting. (Quit: Ardesco)
[2014-12-03 09:18:21] Cow_woC: We're talking about crawling a page that uses Flash, JS and other wonderful things.
[2014-12-03 09:18:49] jimevans: Cow_woC: re: resistance to tabs. because as lukeis says, conceptually, there is no difference between a new tab and a new window. from the point of view of the DOM, both represent a new "top-level browsing context"
[2014-12-03 09:19:10] emakiej, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:19:48] Cow_woC: lukeis: No, for two reasons I mentioned above. Tabs are easier to keep track of for my use-case (tab1 spawns work in tab2, which spawns work in tab3).. this helps me visualize what is going on versus windows where I have a hard time figuring out who did what. Secondly, I need to shut down and restore multiple tabs at once. You can do that with tabs but not with windows.
[2014-12-03 09:20:21] Cow_woC: jimevans: That might be true for a computer, but not true for the human reviewing the operation.
[2014-12-03 09:20:31] errant_rider: cowwoc you're crawling the page with these things(like flash) that selenium can't read?
[2014-12-03 09:20:48] Cow_woC: jimevans: Tabs are mostly a UI benefit. I don't think anyone was implying otherwise.
[2014-12-03 09:20:50] jimevans: i'm not disputing your assertion. you asked why the resistance, i'm providing a high-level reason.
[2014-12-03 09:20:57] lukeis: automation + human interaction is probably setting you up for a bad experience
[2014-12-03 09:21:23] jimevans: lukeis: g'day mate.
[2014-12-03 09:21:29] lukeis: g'day jimevans
[2014-12-03 09:21:30] Cow_woC: errant_rider: I'm crawling a page that must execute some code in JS or Flash in order to render correctly. I don't care about reading the content. I care about being able to follow the links it creates.
[2014-12-03 09:21:36] lukeis: bart was a beast this morning...
[2014-12-03 09:21:39] Cow_woC: jimevans: fair enough :)
[2014-12-03 09:21:46] jimevans: lukeis: can you take a look at #8243?
[2014-12-03 09:21:48] selbot2: 03---- open/New Executing JavaScript returns wrong data on IE - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=8243 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Lang-Python ]
[2014-12-03 09:22:04] jimevans: i've tried this in .net and there are java tests that do this, and neither is failing.
[2014-12-03 09:22:07] *lukeis looking…'
[2014-12-03 09:22:44] Cow_woC: lukeis: "automation + human interaction is probably setting you up for a bad experience" <-- human interaction only occurs when debugging why automation failed. But it's important to make Selenium code easier to debug.
[2014-12-03 09:23:06] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:23:10] jimevans: lukeis: not right away, if it's not convenient, but i'm at a loss to explain the behavior.
[2014-12-03 09:23:28] lukeis: there's other tricks to make that efficient for human debugging rather than tabs… like focusing the current window
[2014-12-03 09:23:29] barancev: "it's important to make Selenium code easier to debug." -- golden words!
[2014-12-03 09:24:21] Cow_woC: barancev: Are you being sarcastic or are you in agreement? :)
[2014-12-03 09:24:28] lukeis: agreement ;)
[2014-12-03 09:24:33] Cow_woC: Okay, thanks :)
[2014-12-03 09:25:08] barancev: agreements, of course
[2014-12-03 09:25:57] barancev: whoever wrote WDBS -- how to debug it, ffs?
[2014-12-03 09:26:15] lukeis: :whobrokeit
[2014-12-03 09:26:15] selbot2: simonstewart
[2014-12-03 09:26:45] Cow_woC: lukeis: Focusing the current window doesn't really help in this case. You've got a graph where window1 contained a link that led to window2 which contained a link which led to window3, and so on... and every time you finish processing the "sub-pages" you want to close that window and go one level up/back. If you use multiple windows (versus tabs) this is much harder to debug/visualize.
[2014-12-03 09:27:53] Cow_woC: lukeis: I need some way to highlight the relationship between the various windows (who opened who). Tabs do this in an intuitive manner (left tab opened the one to its right) like breadcrumbs.
[2014-12-03 09:28:13] Cow_woC: lukeis: If I could do the same with windows, I would.
[2014-12-03 09:28:17] lukeis: you could also reposition and resize the windows :)
[2014-12-03 09:28:33] Cow_woC: lukeis: I can't fit more than 3-4 levels this way. With tabs I can easily go up to 30-40.
[2014-12-03 09:28:36] lukeis: (hopefully you have a big monitor)
[2014-12-03 09:28:39] Cow_woC: :)
[2014-12-03 09:28:40] Cow_woC: Right.
[2014-12-03 09:29:09] Cow_woC: So yeah... like I said, this is mostly a UI thing and I think there is a very strong demand for it for that reason.
[2014-12-03 09:29:38] lukeis: well, like it's been said, your case is certainly an edge case… not likely going to be 'strong demand'
[2014-12-03 09:30:18] Cow_woC: barancev: Hmm, which brings up a related question: is it really legal for Chromedriver to kill the process in WebDriver.quit()? I mean, should the specification really allow this sort of thing?
[2014-12-03 09:30:34] lukeis: there's classically been technical hurdles to controlling the tabs adequately, although i think most of those hurdles no longer exist
[2014-12-03 09:30:52] jimevans: lukeis: that's not true for all browsers. :)
[2014-12-03 09:31:00] lukeis: yes, IE does a fantastic job :)
[2014-12-03 09:31:05] lukeis: Cow_woC: use IE? :-D
[2014-12-03 09:31:22] Cow_woC: lukeis: What do you mean? :)
[2014-12-03 09:31:23] jimevans: the developer of the IE driver is a hack. i wouldn't trust that guy's code.
[2014-12-03 09:31:28] lukeis: InternetExplorer
[2014-12-03 09:31:31] lukeis: the browser
[2014-12-03 09:31:36] Cow_woC: lukeis: Yes, but what about it?
[2014-12-03 09:31:37] barancev: Cow_woC: it is intended, not only allowed
[2014-12-03 09:31:40] lukeis: it uses tabs
[2014-12-03 09:31:51] jimevans: um, no, it doesn't.
[2014-12-03 09:31:55] jimevans: that's the point.
[2014-12-03 09:32:11] lukeis: oh, the IE11 by TheJohnJansen does...
[2014-12-03 09:32:11] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't handle tabs particularly well, and there are technical hurdles to doing so.
[2014-12-03 09:32:22] Cow_woC: barancev: That's surprising. Is there a way for me to gracefully shut down the browser (according to the specification)?
[2014-12-03 09:32:34] *lukeis goes back to not caring about IE...'
[2014-12-03 09:32:36] lukeis: :-D
[2014-12-03 09:32:37] jimevans: yes, well, the microsoft implementation would be fine. if it weren't terminally limited in its execution.
[2014-12-03 09:33:12] Cow_woC: lukeis: 9.5% of the world can't be wrong... 9.2% ... 8.5%.... :)
[2014-12-03 09:33:18] barancev: Cow_woC: selenium attempds to stop the browser gracefully. if it does not want to stop we kill it
[2014-12-03 09:33:38] barancev: what's the issue with quit?
[2014-12-03 09:33:41] Cow_woC: barancev: I'm fine with that. But Chrome kills it immediately no matter what.
[2014-12-03 09:33:47] Cow_woC: Chrome -> Chromedriver.
[2014-12-03 09:34:01] jimevans: barancev: actually, the spec is silent on *how* a driver should terminate the browser, merely that it should do so for quit().
[2014-12-03 09:34:21] losh, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-12-03 09:34:33] jimevans: and in reality, quit may not yet be defined in the spec.
[2014-12-03 09:34:50] jimevans: which is a gross oversight for which there's already a bug against the spec if it hasn't been resolved yet.
[2014-12-03 09:35:27] barancev: Cow_woC: ok, the driver kills the unwanted browser process. so what?
[2014-12-03 09:35:45] Cow_woC: The reason this is problematic is that: 1. There is a chance you will lose the browser session, and if you don't you have to click an infobar on start to restore it (in short, it's problematic) 2. You end up with zombie Chrome icons in the Windows taskbar.
[2014-12-03 09:36:01] TheSturz, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:36:19] jimevans: Cow_woC: 2. (cont)… which disappear the moment you move a mouse cursor over them.
[2014-12-03 09:36:21] Cow_woC: barancev: Well, that's not my intent. My intent is to shut down the browser gracefully if possible. If not, I'm fine killing it. But the driver doesn't even try.
[2014-12-03 09:36:30] Cow_woC: jimevans: Yes, that's true.
[2014-12-03 09:36:51] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 805
[2014-12-03 09:36:57] jimevans: the notification area is one of the most misused pieces of UI in windows.
[2014-12-03 09:37:25] Cow_woC: I just think that killing the process is always going to lead to more issues than shutting down gracefully, so we should try the latter first.
[2014-12-03 09:37:40] barancev: Cow_woC: what issues, exactly?
[2014-12-03 09:37:47] bimmelino, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-12-03 09:37:47] Cow_woC: barancev: mentioned above.
[2014-12-03 09:38:02] Cow_woC: barancev: Loss of browser session, funky icons in the taskbar.
[2014-12-03 09:38:11] jimevans: Cow_woC: i happen to agree with you re: quit() should gracefully shutdown the browser.
[2014-12-03 09:38:37] jimevans: i'll also point out that the chrome driver *is* open-source. then i will duck out of the way as you throw things at me.
[2014-12-03 09:38:38] Cow_woC: In fact, it would be nice to have quit() and kill() and let the user manually decide to invoke the latter if the former times out.
[2014-12-03 09:39:03] barancev: what do you mean by "loss of session"? the browser gone. all done. what session?
[2014-12-03 09:39:08] Cow_woC: jimevans: Yeah :) Too bad you must download 30GB of source-code and go through hell to build it.
[2014-12-03 09:39:21] Cow_woC: jimevans: It's really too bad they bundled it with Chromium.
[2014-12-03 09:39:26] jimevans: Cow_woC: progress is pain. learn to live. :)
[2014-12-03 09:39:52] Cow_woC: barancev: In Chrome and Firefox there are options for restoring the session the next time the browser is launched. If you kill the browser, you lose that.
[2014-12-03 09:40:10] barancev: that's about start, not quit
[2014-12-03 09:40:15] jimevans: i don't think it's too bad at all. if building the driver as part of the browser project itself yields a driver that takes full advantage of knowing the internals of the browser, i'm all for it.
[2014-12-03 09:40:16] Cow_woC: barancev: Hence, if you want to reuse a custom profile directory there is a good justification for graceful shutdown.
[2014-12-03 09:40:39] ArSn, quitting. (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[2014-12-03 09:40:42] Cow_woC: barancev: It's about both start and quit. You can't restore a session unless you shut down cleanly.
[2014-12-03 09:40:49] barancev: I vote to disable reusing profile :)
[2014-12-03 09:40:59] Cow_woC: jimevans: Keyword: if.
[2014-12-03 09:41:21] jimevans: one only need look at the IE driver to realize how difficult it is to create a driver that relies solely on externally-facing APIs
[2014-12-03 09:41:25] Cow_woC: barancev: So you're choosing ease of implementation over user benefit. Oh well.
[2014-12-03 09:42:45] Cow_woC: barancev: All good APIs build on encapsulation: you're supposed to work your ass off under the hood to implement a feature that looks simple on top.

[2014-12-03 09:43:09] Cow_woC: barancev: And in any case, implementing this (graceful shutdown) doesn't sound like something that would be any more difficult than killing the process.
[2014-12-03 09:43:23] barancev: I'm heartless to users :)
[2014-12-03 09:43:31] Cow_woC: hehe
[2014-12-03 09:43:36] Cow_woC: barancev: Be nice :)
[2014-12-03 09:43:45] barancev: but I agree that quit should try gracefull shutdown, for the record
[2014-12-03 09:43:55] jimevans: Cow_woC: you've clearly thought a lot about this. i'm sure the chromium team would welcome contributions, as would the maintainers of any of the other drivers for given browsers.
[2014-12-03 09:44:23] errant_rider: i mean, 30g is an overnite download right?
[2014-12-03 09:45:01] Cow_woC: jimevans: Their project is too heavy for me to consider contributing, sorry.
[2014-12-03 09:45:09] Cow_woC: jimevans: The learning curve is way too high.
[2014-12-03 09:45:17] Cow_woC: errant_rider: :)
[2014-12-03 09:45:38] jimevans: i see.
[2014-12-03 09:46:38] errant_rider: thats a mistake Cow_woC…think of it as an amazing chance
[2014-12-03 09:46:39] Cow_woC: jimevans: They need to find a way to isolate building/running chromedriver from building chrome. I should be able to link it against a prebuilt version of Chrome or something.
[2014-12-03 09:46:51] Cow_woC: jimevans: That would make it much easier to contribute to their project.
[2014-12-03 09:47:24] Cow_woC: errant_rider: I've been working on open-source projects for 12 years now. At some point you get a bit tired of these kinds of projects.
[2014-12-03 09:48:36] Cow_woC: errant_rider: On the one hand I don't blame them (building a browser is very complex) but on the other hand this is not a project you can quickly jump into to contribute in a meaningful way.
[2014-12-03 09:49:01] Cow_woC: errant_rider: You need to pick your battles. You know what I mean? :)
[2014-12-03 09:49:22] jimevans: for what it's worth, i've been disappointed with the level of engagement from the chromium team too.
[2014-12-03 09:49:56] jimevans: and i say that as someone who is working with them directly via the w3c working group preparing the webdriver spec.
[2014-12-03 09:50:10] barancev: also, marionette developement is bit slow too :)
[2014-12-03 09:50:20] barancev: we expected it in FF31
[2014-12-03 09:50:24] jimevans: barancev: that's largely a resource problem.
[2014-12-03 09:50:57] barancev: jimevans: also the standard incompleteness

[2014-12-03 09:55:02] barancev: marionette it a brand new FirefoxDriver
[2014-12-03 09:55:46] barancev: Cow_woC: do you want help to perform the migration? :)
[2014-12-03 09:57:42] barancev: the only massive part to move is issue tracker
[2014-12-03 09:59:06] Cow_woC: barancev: Very cool (regarding marionette). What is it supposed to improve?
[2014-12-03 09:59:31] barancev: everything!
[2014-12-03 09:59:45] Cow_woC: barancev: Re: issue tracker, I've seen many projects move from Google Code to Github and automate the issue migration. I think there must be tools for that sort of thing because they all got migrated in the same style.
[2014-12-03 10:00:02] Cow_woC: barancev: In short... I think that should be very doable.
[2014-12-03 10:00:18] barancev: it is doable, but tricky
[2014-12-03 10:00:31] Cow_woC: <rant>That said, I'm not a fan of Git so I actually favor Bitbucket instead</rant> but that's highly subjective so feel free to ignore it :)

[2014-12-03 13:12:39] smccarthy: Starting the selenium grid as a service is bad idea right? I think I read places that some odd things can happen when its started as a service, like maybe screenshots ?
[2014-12-03 13:12:47] smccarthy: a windows service that is
[2014-12-03 13:12:57] dimacus: yeah
[2014-12-03 13:13:01] dimacus: best to do it via batch
[2014-12-03 13:13:10] dimacus: it's the whole GUI vs GUILess modes
[2014-12-03 13:13:17] dimacus: super weird behavior
[2014-12-03 13:13:20] dimacus: especially in IE
[2014-12-03 13:13:21] smccarthy: with an auto login?
[2014-12-03 13:13:28] dimacus: yup that's what i did
[2014-12-03 13:13:36] dimacus: auto login and placed a bat in start up folder
[2014-12-03 13:13:37] smccarthy: because auto login has proved to be a tough nut to crack for me lol...
[2014-12-03 13:13:45] dimacus: really?
[2014-12-03 13:13:47] dimacus: what OS?
[2014-12-03 13:13:50] smccarthy: win 7
[2014-12-03 13:13:56] dimacus: it's super simple

[2014-12-03 13:14:52] wmp: how can i open svg file and regexp on it code?
[2014-12-03 13:15:11] dimacus: wmp: what do you need to do that?

[2014-12-03 13:15:26] wmp: dimacus: i need to select data from svg file
[2014-12-03 13:15:28] smccarthy: checking it out now dimacus. Though I am sure I read most of these tutorials already. Maybe auto login is working, but my scheduled task isnt working ?
[2014-12-03 13:15:33] wmp: and put this data to form
[2014-12-03 13:15:34] smccarthy: will try it out again right now tho
[2014-12-03 13:15:57] dimacus: wmp: what language?
[2014-12-03 13:16:16] wmp: dimacus: i trying to do this in Selenium IDE
[2014-12-03 13:16:37] dimacus: smccarthy: seriously 1 check box, and it auto logs into the user, and don't use the scheduled task, it seems to be wonky, batch file in start up folder is by far the most stable solution
[2014-12-03 13:16:53] smccarthy: ok will try that now thx
[2014-12-03 13:17:03] dimacus: wmp: i don't want to say it's impossible, but it's imposible
