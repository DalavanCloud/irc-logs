[2014-12-12 06:31:46] andy_seit: Could a flaky network cause browser appcrashes on grid nodes?
[2014-12-12 06:32:08] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-12 06:33:52] dimacus: elaborate more
[2014-12-12 06:40:19] andy_seit: From around 24 hrs ago I'm seeing iedriverserver and firefox.exe showing appcrashes in event viewer
[2014-12-12 06:40:42] andy_seit: i have a nagging feeling we're seeing network problems
[2014-12-12 06:40:53] andy_seit: but Im not sure if that would result in actual appcrashes
[2014-12-12 06:41:15] andy_seit: Im also seeing lots of orphaned browser instances on the nodes
[2014-12-12 06:41:51] dimacus: hmmmm i can see orphaned browsers being the issue
[2014-12-12 06:42:02] dimacus: appcrashes… possible but a little harder to swallow
[2014-12-12 06:42:19] andy_seit: as in, an existing orphaned browser causing an appcrash in a subsequent browser instance?
[2014-12-12 06:43:21] dimacus: i've seen this situation before: a browser crashes, but doe not exit so it's orphaned. Because of it all subsequent browsers don't exit, giving the node 30 or more open chrome windows
[2014-12-12 06:43:32] andy_seit: ahh
[2014-12-12 06:43:51] andy_seit: so if a browser is orphaned it means subsequent browsers cant teardown?  I didn't know that
[2014-12-12 06:43:52] dimacus: do you kill iedriver.exe and chromedriver.exe after each build?
[2014-12-12 06:44:06] dimacus: yes but it's an edge case
[2014-12-12 06:44:09] andy_seit: we have a health check that clears up processes but its lazy
[2014-12-12 06:44:27] andy_seit: nothing as clever as sge
[2014-12-12 06:44:54] dimacus: yeah i've noticed that killing all the remaining browsers and instances of iedriver.exe and chromedriver.exe improved this situation for us
[2014-12-12 06:45:15] andy_seit: Ok great, thanks Dima that gives me something to go on.
[2014-12-12 06:45:44] dimacus: yeah, that's what i've been trying to do in grid extras
[2014-12-12 06:45:53] dimacus: kill chromedriver.exe and iedriver.exe post every build
[2014-12-12 06:46:03] dimacus: still a little buggy but i'm slowly improving it
[2014-12-12 06:46:43] dimacus: also… if you want a huge jump in stabiulity… just reboot the winodws node after every tiest
[2014-12-12 06:46:53] dimacus: i swear you will forget about majority of your problems ;)

[2014-12-12 06:49:31] andy_seit: Yeah, we're playing with sge at the moment.  The ability to browser-kill on setup is a big plus.
[2014-12-12 06:50:26] dimacus: yeah i just want the damn video recording and live view of the node as test is running to be over… that feature is giving me a heartburn everytime i think about it

[2014-12-12 06:54:48] andy_seit: no problems at all
[2014-12-12 06:54:52] andy_seit: ah

[2014-12-12 07:05:25] Dave_B_: my browser cleanup is shocking, it's just looking fror browser / driver processes that were started longer than 15 mins ago and killing them & all children. :o
[2014-12-12 07:05:34] smccarthy: dimacus: what if you reboot the only IE9 node, and another request for an IE9 browser gets sent to the hub. Won't it get rejected because there are no IE9 browsers available on any nodes ?
[2014-12-12 07:05:35] Dave_B_: should improve that sometime!
[2014-12-12 07:05:55] dimacus: smccarthy: yup
[2014-12-12 07:05:58] Dave_B_: smccarthy: Reboot should be fast enough that the node is still there but unavailable so it'll wait, no?
[2014-12-12 07:06:13] dimacus: but my VM reboots typically in 7 seconds flat
[2014-12-12 07:06:20] dimacus: and i keep 3 of each just in case
[2014-12-12 07:06:27] smccarthy: I timed mine, and its between 1-2 minutes lol
[2014-12-12 07:06:40] dimacus: it's all about the VMs baby ;)
[2014-12-12 07:06:48] smccarthy: Dave_B_: can you share your browser cleanup script ?
[2014-12-12 07:07:28] Dave_B_: sure, but just so you know it's terribad (also aimed at windows VMs) - runs using python
[2014-12-12 07:07:29] dimacus: i'm thinking that instead of the node, next version of grid extras will check if there are any items in the queue
[2014-12-12 07:07:34] dimacus: and based on that kill things
[2014-12-12 07:07:39] dimacus: without reboot
[2014-12-12 07:08:18] Dave_B_: smccarthy: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/9d533f6f6ead0c9cb6c9
[2014-12-12 07:08:21] andy_seit: we've been working on cleanup in a side project atm, killing all relevant .exes when a new test session hits the node seems cleanest
[2014-12-12 07:08:36] Dave_B_: oh, it kills parents too, forgot about that

[2014-12-12 07:45:05] dimacus: ratem: ok i'm confused by this

[2014-12-12 07:45:29] andy_seit: dimacus: Hmm.  Yeah I thought SO_TIMEOUT was comms thing.  I suppose that could make sense though, they tend to happen after a navigate step that takes a long time.
[2014-12-12 07:46:12] ratem: do you have a proper start script?
[2014-12-12 07:46:31] dimacus: ratem: so couple of notes,
[2014-12-12 07:46:48] dimacus: typically i use the "vncserver" as the start scritp, and that defaults to xvfb
[2014-12-12 07:46:56] dimacus: just a better linux sys admin practice
[2014-12-12 07:47:53] dimacus: mine is typically like this: vncserver :99 -geometry 1024x768

[2014-12-12 07:49:15] ratem: oh i see
[2014-12-12 07:49:47] dimacus: also, pro tip… restart XVFB at least 1 time a day… if you run it non stop for a week or two… all of your tests start to run 3x slower
[2014-12-12 07:49:50] dimacus: IDK why
[2014-12-12 07:50:04] ratem: oO
[2014-12-12 07:50:13] ratem: i was running mine for like one month on my other box :O
[2014-12-12 07:50:18] ratem: lmao
[2014-12-12 07:50:37] dimacus: yeah… can't explain, just remeber that after a week or two of using xfvb a normal 1min test started to take 30min to complete
[2014-12-12 07:50:40] ratem: i also read to restart grid regular. is that right?
[2014-12-12 07:50:42] dimacus: bd firefox was just so slow
[2014-12-12 07:50:45] dimacus: yea
[2014-12-12 07:51:44] smccarthy: ratem: yea def restart grid.
[2014-12-12 07:51:58] dimacus: ratem: so only thing that is suspicious to me is this part

[2014-12-12 07:52:41] dimacus: since you are running as a daemon i wonder if your export display gets lost in the &&
[2014-12-12 07:53:13] dimacus: by setting it explicitly before "/usr/bin/java" you are setting DISPLAY var for only 1 command instead of the current session
[2014-12-12 07:53:27] dimacus: also!!

[2014-12-12 07:54:47] dimacus: the -l flag in shell flag will load all user variables… just as JAVA_HOME etc… that should help with a lot of weirdness
[2014-12-12 07:55:18] ratem: should I add this flag in grid, node and xfvb script?
[2014-12-12 07:55:53] dimacus: probably a good idea to add it everywhere, bc if you don't , sometimes the $PATH is not loaded

[2014-12-12 11:21:47] sx: Is there an easy way to specify headers, including cookies, when making an initial HTTP request?
[2014-12-12 11:22:22] lampd1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-12-12 11:22:42] sx: At least in the python-selenium documentation, it appears that there is not. Which is mind boggling considering you can do this with curl and wget.
[2014-12-12 11:22:54] jimevans: use a library that's designed to automate the actual HTTP request, and not the browser?
[2014-12-12 11:23:58] jimevans: i mean, look at it this way: does the browser expose an easy way, not accessible through developer tools or plugins, for the user to manipulate those things?
[2014-12-12 11:24:01] sx: jimevans:  hmm and would that play well with selenium? i.e http library to formulate request, then selenium jumps in to interact w the loaded response?
[2014-12-12 11:24:08] sx: yeah I get your point
[2014-12-12 11:24:50] sx: jimevans: and to that point I would say yes. My browser remembers session cookies.
[2014-12-12 11:24:51] jimevans: on the other hand, the webdriver library *does* make it pretty easy to put a programmable software proxy between the browser and the HTTP server.
[2014-12-12 11:25:28] jimevans: sx: ah. but you specifically mentioned "headers", which is a much broader ask than just for cookies.
[2014-12-12 11:25:54] jimevans: if cookies is all you're interested in, then that's a little easier, and you have a few options at your disposal.
[2014-12-12 11:26:03] sx: Ok but even for cookies only, I *never* have to login to my facebook account, for example, using my basic browser. But with selenium, I have to first make an unauthorized request then add cookies to a second request.
[2014-12-12 11:26:34] jimevans: yep. usually because the browser your using "remembers" those cookies as part of the profile you're using.
[2014-12-12 11:26:51] jimevans: (i'm looking at firefox and chrome, specifically; IE is a special beast)
[2014-12-12 11:27:04] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 827
[2014-12-12 11:27:37] jimevans: so set up the profile ahead of time, and ask webdriver to use that profile (or more correctly, a copy of that profile)

[2014-12-12 11:28:23] sx: jimevans: thanks. "profile" is the word I needed for my next round of googling.
[2014-12-12 11:28:44] jimevans: sorry if i seem brusque with this, but i get annoyed when someone says "why can't selenium do foo when it's so easy with the bar tool" when the end goals of selenium and bar are vastly different.
[2014-12-12 11:30:04] sx: jimevans: np sometimes brusquness is necessary.
[2014-12-12 11:30:50] jimevans: sx: not usually. and it's not my normal mode of communication. but it's been a long week, and i'm hungry, and i've got an afternoon of meetings staring me in the face.
[2014-12-12 11:36:04] jleyba: sx: you can set cookies through the Selenium API, you just need to be on the correct domain first
[2014-12-12 11:36:37] jleyba: so for something like facebook, get a 404 page that loads quickly, set your cookies, then proceed to the authenticated page
[2014-12-12 11:37:44] sx: jleyba: yes I was trying to avoid that method because I would my initial request to facebook to have cookies set. so I think I must load a profile prior to the first request, as suggested by jimevans

[2014-12-12 14:25:48] jherm: I exported a coworker's recordings from Selenium IDE into Python 2 / unittest / WebDriver and I'm finding that <option> selection is not working in latest Firefox (Mac 34.0), anyone got any clues?

[2014-12-12 14:27:19] AutomatedTester: lol
[2014-12-12 14:27:35] AutomatedTester: lukeis: that bug is hilarious
[2014-12-12 14:27:53] AutomatedTester: jherm: can you give a little more info
[2014-12-12 14:28:31] AutomatedTester: we have tests that make sure that works so it not working for you seems like it could be a bigger issue
[2014-12-12 14:29:30] jherm: Sure. The exported code looks like this:
[2014-12-12 14:29:32] jherm: 	Select(driver.find_element_by_id("export_volume_select")).select_by_visible_text("4k")
[2014-12-12 14:29:33] jherm: 	driver.find_element_by_css_selector("option[value=\"4k\"]").click()
[2014-12-12 14:30:20] jherm: During the test run, code gets to that line and I see the option given focus (it turns blue) but it's as though the option has not been clicked yet, only moused over
[2014-12-12 14:30:38] jherm: then next line executes
[2014-12-12 14:30:59] jherm: Both the option innertext and value are the same and should match
[2014-12-12 14:31:31] AutomatedTester: jherm: can you make a reduced test case for us?
[2014-12-12 14:32:23] jherm: I can try, yeah. BRB

[2014-12-12 17:38:25] Arven: I've just started working with Selenium, and it's pretty simple once you get the hang of PageFactory and XPath. However I'd love a framework for driving non-Web applications. Is there anything with a similar API?
