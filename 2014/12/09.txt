[2014-12-09 09:16:51] Pimper: Hello, I would like to know if it is possible and how to download all the javascripts from a specific website with selenium+webdriver.  Any hint? Also, is it possible to access the actual javascripts api calls?
[2014-12-09 09:18:12] jimevans: Pimper: calling javascript already loaded by the page is easy. as for anything else, it might be useful to get a bigger picture of what you're trying to accomplish.
[2014-12-09 09:20:07] Pimper: The idea is that there are some javascripts that are obfuscated so we would like to know what are the exact javascript api callsthat this obfuscated js is doing when it is executed
[2014-12-09 09:20:37] jimevans: i'm still not sure i see the point.
[2014-12-09 09:20:38] ulmi, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-12-09 09:21:54] jimevans: even if you could download and save off the raw javascript files, webdriver isn't going to magically unminify those for you.
[2014-12-09 09:22:47] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2014-12-09 09:22:56] jimevans: additionally, if it's a javascript widget framework, many (most?) of those are open-source, so you can examine the source code at your leisure.
[2014-12-09 09:23:47] jimevans: so while you *might* be able to do it, i still don't see why you'd want to.
[2014-12-09 09:24:36] Pimper: btw, thx for replying jimevans. First thing I would like to do is list all the javascripts that a website loads when you access to it. Then, I will probably download them separately. For all of this it is not necessary to execute them.
[2014-12-09 09:25:54] jimevans: i guess you could try finding the <script> tags in the document, and looking at the src attribute, but that might not be entirely reliable.
[2014-12-09 09:26:04] jimevans: of course, i'm still not seeing the point.
[2014-12-09 09:26:09] jimevans: but whatever.
[2014-12-09 09:26:24] Pimper: Second I would like to execute them, and try to catch the actual calls from a specific js to the js function mousepressed() for example, is that possible?

[2014-12-09 09:32:00] Pimper: I'm sorry, I'm just invented that one. The problem is that there are some js that are obfuscated so I can't understand the code. But I would like to see what exactly calls it is doing when it is executed: (again inventing) while(), if(), ...

[2014-12-09 11:41:44] tkueck: Quick selenium question is there a way to do not equals with cssSelectors? We have the concept of filled and empty images. Fill images have a html tag value "page_photo_#" where # is an int. Unfilled image wells have "page_photo_NaN". We're currently using "img[data-test-key^='page_photo']" which works, but will find both. Would be nice to specify something like "img[data-test-key!='page_photo_NaN']"

[2014-12-09 11:44:18] jimevans: tkueck: will the :not pseduoselector work? that's a css 3 selector, so it won't work on IE8 or lower, but it might be a way forward.
[2014-12-09 11:45:17] tkueck: i've never heard of/used it, do you have any examples?

[2014-12-09 11:56:05] AutomatedTester: evening all
[2014-12-09 11:56:28] tkueck: I tried "img:not[data-test-key='page_photo_NaN']" and it is listed as a valid css selector. a bit of googling suggests selenium doesn't doesn't support pseudoselectors
[2014-12-09 11:56:58] jimevans: tkueck: not true.
[2014-12-09 11:56:58] AutomatedTester: tkueck: we support whatever the browser supports
[2014-12-09 11:57:06] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 814
[2014-12-09 11:57:07] jimevans: it doesn't support the :contains pseudoselector.
[2014-12-09 11:57:38] jimevans: (because not part of any CSS standard)
[2014-12-09 11:58:00] AutomatedTester: it was removed from a css standard iirc
[2014-12-09 11:58:15] jimevans: as it should be.
[2014-12-09 11:58:24] tkueck: i'm 99% certain ff33 supports the not selector
[2014-12-09 11:58:38] AutomatedTester: tkueck: it does
[2014-12-09 11:58:50] jimevans: css selectors are (or should be) about *style*. "contains" is about *content*

[2014-12-09 12:00:33] jimevans: you don't. :)
[2014-12-09 12:02:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: well you can style the first line of an element
[2014-12-09 12:02:34] AutomatedTester: or the first letter

[2014-12-09 12:05:37] jimevans: i do wish that the opera guys hadn't decided to put the version of the blinkopera driver executable in the name of the file.
[2014-12-09 12:06:01] AutomatedTester: ?
[2014-12-09 12:06:35] jimevans: when you download the chromium-based opera driver, you get an executable named operadriver-0.1.0-win32.exe
[2014-12-09 12:07:30] jimevans: makes language bindings automatically finding the executable a pain in the rear.
[2014-12-09 12:08:29] AutomatedTester: jimevans: interesting... they appear to assume that it will always be passed in
[2014-12-09 12:08:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: raise a bug, its their problem to sort
[2014-12-09 12:08:45] jimevans: agreed, and i plan to.

[2014-12-09 22:45:21] susundberg: _cmosguy_: yeah, i am here, but dont know any help to what you are asking for so i stay quiet.
[2014-12-09 22:45:36] _cmosguy_: susundberg, hmm...
[2014-12-09 22:45:36] _cmosguy_: ok
[2014-12-09 22:46:03] susundberg: to be honest, i dont see why you would want to inject javascript via selenium to browser, but i am quite green on selenium so i guess you have your reasons
[2014-12-09 22:46:04] _cmosguy_: i am basically having issues injecting jquery commands into the browser for testing
[2014-12-09 22:46:08] _cmosguy_: i keep getting null
[2014-12-09 22:46:28] _cmosguy_: susundberg, it's because my content is dynamically changing
[2014-12-09 22:46:52] susundberg: Yeah, thats the usual case -- i have similar case but i do not inject javascript to test it
[2014-12-09 22:46:54] _cmosguy_: the Xpath find does not seem to work so jquery is the methodology to use
[2014-12-09 22:47:01] _cmosguy_: susundberg, oh
[2014-12-09 22:47:10] _cmosguy_: what is your solution might i ask?
[2014-12-09 22:47:14] susundberg: finding elements is pain in the ass ..
[2014-12-09 22:47:23] _cmosguy_: susundberg, it sure is
[2014-12-09 22:47:24] susundberg: as you said, find elements
[2014-12-09 22:47:28] _cmosguy_: i am about to punch my monitor
[2014-12-09 22:47:31] susundberg: :)
[2014-12-09 22:47:37] _cmosguy_: what does one do?
[2014-12-09 22:48:00] _cmosguy_: btw: this is what my selenium command is showing: Executing: [execute script: return $('*:contains("Logout")').children().length >0;, []])
[2014-12-09 22:48:03] susundberg: Well, i use firefox 'find element' intensivly
[2014-12-09 22:48:04] _cmosguy_: it keeps returning null
[2014-12-09 22:48:19] _cmosguy_: i am using PHP to command the selenium
[2014-12-09 22:48:34] _cmosguy_: but could you give me some idea or example how you would find some text?
[2014-12-09 22:48:39] susundberg: i dont know about the injection of javascript, really, but i would maybe start checking if some simple find works
[2014-12-09 22:48:56] susundberg: https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors
[2014-12-09 22:49:09] susundberg: this is my 'cheat sheet
[2014-12-09 22:50:07] susundberg: and -- usually when i hit brick wall "wtf, it just dont work", i modify code so it produces more 'debug flags' like classes and ids on every element i want to find
[2014-12-09 22:50:37] susundberg: but like i said, i am kind of green with selenium, so i suggest you do take my advices with caution
[2014-12-09 22:50:53] _cmosguy_: yeah susundberg i am more green than you
[2014-12-09 22:51:04] _cmosguy_: i'll take in any information i can find
[2014-12-09 22:51:35] _cmosguy_: how do you debug your xpath statements?
[2014-12-09 22:51:39] _cmosguy_: have you figured that out?
[2014-12-09 22:53:16] susundberg: No i have not, i have used selenium ide to check for the elements finders
[2014-12-09 22:53:37] _cmosguy_: in firefox?
[2014-12-09 22:53:40] susundberg: yah
