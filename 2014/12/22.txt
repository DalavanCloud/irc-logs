[2014-12-22 05:22:06] Dave_B_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-22 05:24:47] twinings: repeated testing of a website on selenium ide, and trying different techniques such as clickandwait, or waitforpagetoload, or waitforelementpresent.      and with all of these, it fails sporadically.
[2014-12-22 05:25:39] twinings: yet the results should be consistent: if selenium is actually waiting, then the test ought to pass.
[2014-12-22 05:27:04] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 838
[2014-12-22 05:32:05] Dave_B_: there are lots of potential reasons e.g. waitforpagetoload and clickandwait both are guessing when the page is loaded, waitforelementpresent waits for that element which isn't to say that there are not still changes going on that may make it invalid again etc
[2014-12-22 05:33:11] Dave_B_: to work out what the problems are we'd at least need to know what the errors were and seeing the site would help - but personally when it's IDE I don't really know what the next step would be.

[2014-12-22 05:42:28] twinings: I wonder what the complexity is.     it appears to be guessing incorrectly, because the assert fails.
[2014-12-22 05:42:43] twinings: but re-running the test from that point, will succeed.
[2014-12-22 05:42:49] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-22 05:44:26] Dave_B_: well, what does page loaded mean? document complete? What about ajax? What about websockets? etc etc
[2014-12-22 05:44:36] AntonioRibeiro, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-12-22 05:44:47] Dave_B_: do you wait for all embedded iframes to complete? and so on
[2014-12-22 05:45:02] twinings: if waitforelementpresent is waiting for that precise element, how can the following command fail and say that element is not present.
[2014-12-22 05:46:44] Dave_B_: the element can be added and removed again before being added once more, it's ugly but not as uncommon as it should to find on websites - or it was present on the page you jsut navigated from so the check passed before even looking at the right page.
[2014-12-22 05:48:11] Dave_B_: (not an exhaustive list, just giving you some ideas)
[2014-12-22 05:48:37] twinings: that could definitely be happening:  "or it was present on the page you jsut navigated from so the check passed before even looking at the right page."
[2014-12-22 05:49:02] twinings: many elements are similar between the pages.    And so it could be already present, even before continuing to the next page.
[2014-12-22 05:49:32] twinings: if that is true... what could be a solution.?

[2014-12-22 05:52:03] Dave_B_: in IDE? I don't know
[2014-12-22 05:52:46] Dave_B_: I use wedriver and create Page Objects that each know something unique about the page they represent, so they make sure they are on the right page before trying any waits, lookups etc
[2014-12-22 05:53:27] Dave_B_: so even if i'm accessing an element that is shared between all pages I know it's the one on the right page I'm getting
[2014-12-22 05:54:01] Dave_B_: there may be an easier way or a good mechanism available in IDE, but I don't know it, sorry :(

[2014-12-22 07:00:09] Dave_B_: is that element always there or does it only appear once other conditions are met?
[2014-12-22 07:00:30] Dave_B_: or is it in an iframe or similar?

[2014-12-22 08:31:04] dimacus: well if you are tired of page object pattern, you have to replace it with the new and exciting buzz wordy pattern

[2014-12-22 10:14:44] dimacus: check your idle session timeout value
[2014-12-22 10:15:05] dimacus: if it's too low, the browser will clear the session if you haven't done anything in X seconds
[2014-12-22 10:18:48] eric_____: What is idle session timeout value?
[2014-12-22 10:18:55] eric_____: And where is it?
[2014-12-22 10:19:15] dimacus: "timeout": 300000,
[2014-12-22 10:19:18] dimacus: is for the idle timeout

[2014-12-22 10:19:33] dimacus: browserTimeout is for page load timeout
[2014-12-22 10:19:46] dimacus: that is, if page did not load in X, the session will be timed out and thrown away
[2014-12-22 10:23:00] eric_____: Hmmm, How would I find where these values are being set?

[2014-12-22 10:38:14] dimacus: all communications are as follows Test -> Hub -> Node -> Browser
[2014-12-22 10:38:33] dimacus: if something happens in that chain for any command, it could stop reciving instructions

[2014-12-22 10:44:21] mtscout6: I set that based on the conversation in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/13
[2014-12-22 10:44:44] mtscout6: If the community as a whole determines that that timeout is too low then we can increase it.
[2014-12-22 10:44:45] eric_____: mtscout6: now I have to brush up on my docker and figure out how to save my locally updated config.json :)
[2014-12-22 10:44:52] eric_____: right on

[2014-12-22 13:39:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I care enough to do what I need
[2014-12-22 13:40:00] jimevans: extor: you don't use selenium to craft raw http post requests and send them to the server.
[2014-12-22 13:40:08] extor: I want my C# app to go out to around 150 different websites, log in, poke around and grab some text and then log off. Some of those sites might have JS which would make it trickier to find a login button or login form off a menu which would only be visible if JS was being parsed and rendered as it would in a regular browser.
[2014-12-22 13:40:24] extor: jimevans oh ok, so wrong tool for the job I guess
[2014-12-22 13:41:03] jimevans: i mean, you can *use* selenium/webdriver to do that, but not by crafting specific http requests.
[2014-12-22 13:41:08] extor: Well at least it might be useful in aquiring the remote site's page if it's riddled in JS and CSS
[2014-12-22 13:41:18] jimevans: and it'd be a nightmare to support, with that many sites
[2014-12-22 13:42:03] extor: I guess the crafting of the http requests could be done by the webclient() class in C#. I could do the post request with added &field=value
