[2014-12-28 10:19:52] ato: _ingsoc: Because WebDriver polls the DOM by design (it doesn't keep a live representation of the DOM internally), it can't tell when the document is properly finished loading.
[2014-12-28 10:20:21] ato: _ingsoc: That is, any elements added after the onload event has fired are likely to not be found unless you use a wait just as you said.
[2014-12-28 10:21:10] ato: _ingsoc: You probably want to do something like this: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/waits.html#explicit-waits

[2014-12-28 10:43:02] _ingsoc: ato: I think that worked. Is it possible to set the timer to 0? To have it wait until it's found? Or does it just keep checking every 10 seconds?

[2014-12-28 10:47:29] ato: _ingsoc: But you can override the timeout with new WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=N).  Note that the timeout is how long it will wait before failing if it can't find it; not how often it polls.
[2014-12-28 10:51:46] _ingsoc: ato: Any idea what this means? "selenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message:"
[2014-12-28 10:51:50] _ingsoc: Just a blank message.
[2014-12-28 10:52:16] ato: Just that it timed out.
