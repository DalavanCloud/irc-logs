[2014-12-17 07:11:45] WhereIsMySpoon: koomi: phantomjs is a poor solution
[2014-12-17 07:11:48] *Dave_B_ facepalms'
[2014-12-17 07:12:00] WhereIsMySpoon: it has its own js rendering engine and is totally different to the -actual- browsers people will be using
[2014-12-17 07:12:26] WhereIsMySpoon: it also is limited in what it can do in terms of automated functionality
[2014-12-17 07:12:33] WhereIsMySpoon: for example, it cant get rid of alerts
[2014-12-17 07:12:34] koomi: ah ok. didn't know that
[2014-12-17 07:12:49] Dave_B_: so because of randomly using windows to run jenkins you're going to replace browser testing with running tests on an engine nobody has ever used to view a web page and that has loads of quirks of its own that will both make it hard to get your tests to run and will mean them passing tells you nothing? :o

[2014-12-17 07:13:36] WhereIsMySpoon: there's no point setting up a test suite and then introducing a lot of hacks just to make it work and check an "Automated Testing" checkbox that wont actually give you anything useful
[2014-12-17 07:13:43] WhereIsMySpoon: may as well not bother
[2014-12-17 07:14:40] koomi: so using PhantomJS is in no way an option to run automated tests?
[2014-12-17 07:15:05] WhereIsMySpoon: its certainly an option, it just wont net you a useful set of results
[2014-12-17 07:15:22] WhereIsMySpoon: if the tests pass, all it tells you is that people who use phantomjs will be able to use your site
[2014-12-17 07:15:29] WhereIsMySpoon: not very helpful I'd imagine :)
[2014-12-17 07:15:34] Dave_B_: I'd use it for some stuff e.g. a per-commit execution of JS unit tests as it's JS engine is mostly the same and will still gain you some confidence with little effort. For acceptance testing…. not so much
[2014-12-17 07:16:30] *Dave_B_ should have said 'I'd consider it'… really'
[2014-12-17 07:16:39] WhereIsMySpoon: koomi: I have personal experience with phantomjs - almost as soon as I started I was introducing hacks to try and make it work
[2014-12-17 07:16:47] WhereIsMySpoon: I then took a step back and decided it wasn't worth it
[2014-12-17 07:16:53] WhereIsMySpoon: and abandoned it

[2014-12-17 07:18:57] koomi: everything is virtual here ;-)
[2014-12-17 07:19:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ...so set up another virtual machine with linux
[2014-12-17 07:19:15] WhereIsMySpoon: it literally takes like 20 minutes

[2014-12-17 08:48:09] lukeis: yeah, i was considering moving it down
[2014-12-17 08:48:10] WhereIsMySpoon: its misleading
[2014-12-17 08:48:16] lukeis: i would not say remove though ;)

[2014-12-17 08:48:45] WhereIsMySpoon: its blaringly on the front page
[2014-12-17 08:48:56] lukeis: yes
[2014-12-17 08:48:59] WhereIsMySpoon: you could at least replace it with a reference to sebuilder
[2014-12-17 08:49:25] lukeis: sebuilder hasn't been fully adopted / the work hasn't been done to make it the replacement recommendation
[2014-12-17 08:49:29] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-12-17 08:49:40] WhereIsMySpoon: well then it should be well marked as deprecated there
[2014-12-17 08:49:52] WhereIsMySpoon: and yes definitely it shouold be moved down the downloads page
[2014-12-17 08:49:59] lukeis: patches welcome ;)

[2014-12-17 09:06:50] emperorcezar: lukeis: Thanks
[2014-12-17 09:07:36] lukeis: emperorcezar: i would suggest looking to see what firefox profile option you could set to start the browser off in a different location?
[2014-12-17 09:08:12] emperorcezar: lukeis: That's sounds like it might be fruitfull. I'll take a look around.
[2014-12-17 09:10:03] lukeis: also, does your app look up location based on what the browser reports in javascript? or is it doing it's own lookup based on the IP address coming to the server?
[2014-12-17 09:10:33] emperorcezar: lukeis: It's done in JS.

[2014-12-17 09:52:46] simonstewart: Right now, I find myself wishing that IJ loaded projects using more than one core
[2014-12-17 09:53:11] simonstewart: I love you like a brother, IntelliJ, but sometimes you can go forget yourself
[2014-12-17 09:53:22] simonstewart: And the mother-forgetting horse you rode in on
[2014-12-17 09:54:32] lukeis: some people use it here against salesforce…. indexing and hotswap issues caused me to tear my eyes out. I know believe IJ is only useful for medium - small sized projects :)
[2014-12-17 09:54:47] lukeis: i now* believe
[2014-12-17 09:54:57] simonstewart: IJ scales up to larger projects than Eclipse

[2014-12-17 09:55:10] lukeis: for some reason not ours :-/
[2014-12-17 09:55:17] simonstewart: You need to feed it memory
[2014-12-17 09:55:21] lukeis: i did
[2014-12-17 09:55:24] simonstewart: By default it's somewhat starved
[2014-12-17 09:55:25] lukeis: i fed that beast :)
[2014-12-17 09:55:36] lukeis: oh yeah, defaults wouldn't even load our project :)
[2014-12-17 09:55:38] simonstewart: I'm working on Buck project generation for IJ
[2014-12-17 09:55:41] lukeis: (to even begin indexing)
[2014-12-17 09:55:46] simonstewart: Right now
[2014-12-17 09:56:18] simonstewart: I'd love to pay SalesForce a visit one day
[2014-12-17 09:56:32] simonstewart: Every time I hear about what's going on there, I can't help but want to take a peek
[2014-12-17 09:56:36] lukeis: whenever you'd like :)

[2014-12-17 09:57:36] simonstewart: I'll be out in Cuba's new BFF in the last week of January and first week of February
[2014-12-17 09:57:40] lukeis: otherwise… i've got no business there
