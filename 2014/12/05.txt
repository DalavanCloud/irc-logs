[2014-12-05 09:48:25] Cow_woC: I only want the first line of the message. The rest (session info, driver info, etc) should not be there.

[2014-12-05 10:01:15] dimacus: Cow_woC: probably not that easy… but you could use some 3rd party tool to parse the log and take things out
[2014-12-05 10:02:40] Cow_woC: dimacus: Where is this sitting in the code? If I file a feature request, do you think we could have a feature for omitting that?
[2014-12-05 10:03:21] Cow_woC: dimacus: It's just that for stack-traces, the message gets repeated once per Exception.getCause() and this is cluttering up the output in a big way. I don't need to know this information while debugging. I just need the first line.

[2014-12-05 15:33:02] lukeis: td[contains(., 'foo')]
[2014-12-05 15:33:26] lukeis: if you're matching text content, xpath is what you have to use
[2014-12-05 15:33:43] lukeis: ideally instead there should be an id or class name of the dom elements and you'd locate that way
[2014-12-05 15:33:52] dunpeal: lukeis: yup, the problem is that lots of <td>'s "contain" a 1

[2014-12-05 15:34:07] dunpeal: so td[contains(., '1')] would be highly ambiguous
[2014-12-05 15:34:08] lukeis: yep, i figured as much :)
[2014-12-05 15:34:17] dunpeal: lukeis: thanks though :)
[2014-12-05 15:34:33] lukeis: i'm sure there's more advanced xpath users who could tell you how to strip whitespace
[2014-12-05 15:34:43] lukeis: but it's not me :)

[2014-12-05 15:38:17] budrose: so I'm able to grab an element and inspect it's "tag_name" and other attributes, but when I attempt to "send_keys" I'm hit with a "ElementNotVisibleException"...any thoughts?
[2014-12-05 15:40:28] dunpeal: Can I make tests run slower, so a human can follow what is going on?
