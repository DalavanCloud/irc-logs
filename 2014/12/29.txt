[2014-12-29 02:53:25] ak77_: I want to do testing with headless selenium. using StandaloneFirefox image from SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium, when I run python unittest with WebDriver, browser appears, but when I use non web-driver it does not
[2014-12-29 02:54:26] ak77_: what could be wrong?
[2014-12-29 02:55:03] ThePeach: ak77_: have you looked into PhantomJS as well?
[2014-12-29 02:55:32] WhereIsMySpoon: eh i dont recommend it
[2014-12-29 02:56:27] ak77_: ThePeach: haven't yet. Seems like it should be possible to do headless with firefox
[2014-12-29 02:56:28] ThePeach: WhereIsMySpoon: any specific reason? I've looked into it, seems interesting but never used it
[2014-12-29 02:56:59] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: it is, just use a virtual VM like xvfb
[2014-12-29 02:57:07] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 858
[2014-12-29 02:57:23] WhereIsMySpoon: ThePeach: it uses a totally different js engine to the one most browsers use and doesnt have all the features that using an actual browser does
[2014-12-29 02:57:26] WhereIsMySpoon: plus it isnt end to end
[2014-12-29 02:57:36] WhereIsMySpoon: none of your users are using PJs
[2014-12-29 02:57:37] ak77_: StandaloneFirefox image runs selenium via the xvfb-run, so it should be headless (as I understand it)
[2014-12-29 02:57:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ive not heard of standalonefirefox
[2014-12-29 02:57:59] ThePeach: WhereIsMySpoon: that's a good point...
[2014-12-29 02:58:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: " but when I use non web-driver it does not " what do you mean non webdriver?
[2014-12-29 02:58:20] WhereIsMySpoon: is this some sort of setting on the image
[2014-12-29 02:59:38] ak77_: WhereIsMySpoon: Using firefox I recorded some actions in a web browser, I can export them to Python in two variants: WebDriver and Remote Control
[2014-12-29 02:59:50] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-12-29 02:59:54] WhereIsMySpoon: you're using  the ide
[2014-12-29 02:59:58] ak77_: so, the RemoteControl one doesn't show browser.
[2014-12-29 03:00:03] *Dave_B_ gets the popcorn'
[2014-12-29 03:00:05] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: ignore the RC one
[2014-12-29 03:00:14] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: its old tech, just export to webdriver
[2014-12-29 03:00:23] ak77_: WhereIsMySpoon: Yes, I do that.
[2014-12-29 03:00:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: but most of all, dont use the ide in the first place tbh, even the export creates badly written tests
[2014-12-29 03:00:38] ak77_: WhereIsMySpoon: I am just pointing out that the RemoteControl one doesn't show Firefox
[2014-12-29 03:00:40] WhereIsMySpoon: code them yourself from scratch
[2014-12-29 03:00:47] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: it doesnt matter, rc is deprecated
[2014-12-29 03:00:51] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt being worked on
[2014-12-29 03:05:48] ak77_: I used ide just to get party started... but now I stumbled upon this non-headless issue

[2014-12-29 03:08:41] Dave_B_: when you say issue - it worked with webdriver?
[2014-12-29 03:08:44] Dave_B_: so not really an issue
[2014-12-29 03:08:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: if its working with webdriver its fine and there is no issue
[2014-12-29 03:08:52] Dave_B_: don't use RC, problem solved :)
[2014-12-29 03:09:00] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: yah thats what i was saying :D
[2014-12-29 03:09:36] ak77_: Dave_B_: the other way around, browser is not shown with RC
[2014-12-29 03:09:52] Dave_B_: so don't use RC
[2014-12-29 03:09:55] Dave_B_: RC is dead
[2014-12-29 03:10:00] Dave_B_: RIP RC
[2014-12-29 03:10:05] Dave_B_: etc etc
[2014-12-29 03:10:38] Dave_B_: you said it worked when you ran it with WebDriver - so run it with WebDriver
[2014-12-29 03:10:38] ak77_: ok, you do not understand me. i want HEADLESS - without browser appearing, with WEBDRIVER browser appears.
[2014-12-29 03:10:44] Dave_B_: ah
[2014-12-29 03:10:46] Dave_B_: lol
[2014-12-29 03:10:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ak77_: ok so now you are saying something else :)
[2014-12-29 03:11:00] ak77_: read my first statement
[2014-12-29 03:11:00] WhereIsMySpoon: or maybe you didnt say it well enough for us ot understand before
[2014-12-29 03:11:08] WhereIsMySpoon: we misunderstood you in any case
[2014-12-29 03:11:14] ak77_: <ak77_> I want to do testing with headless selenium. using StandaloneFirefox image from SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium, when I run python unittest with WebDriver, browser appears, but when I use non web-driver it does not
[2014-12-29 03:11:16] Dave_B_: so you're saying the browser appeared on your host machine, rather than in the docker file?
[2014-12-29 03:11:38] ak77_: Dave_B_: yes, it appears on my host
[2014-12-29 03:12:01] Dave_B_: so I've not used that docker file, but it seems you're using a local webdriver, rather than a remote
[2014-12-29 03:12:35] Dave_B_: in your code you've got a line like driver = Firefox()
[2014-12-29 03:13:05] Dave_B_: rather than something like driver = Remote(something telling it to point at the docker file here)
[2014-12-29 03:13:12] ak77_: Dave_B_: true
[2014-12-29 03:13:24] ak77_: Dave_B_: letme check on that, thank you for now

I'm running 8 threads, each creating and detroying a firefox driver as it needs it. I'm locking on a variable when I'm creating the instances to avoid initialization problems. However, after about 15 minutes, I get an access violation.

[2014-12-29 08:10:53] joshin4colours: so, kind of a silly question
[2014-12-29 08:11:16] joshin4colours: is Marionette the Firefox/Mozilla equivalent of the chromedriver?
[2014-12-29 08:11:25] joshin4colours: or IEDriver?
[2014-12-29 08:14:23] ato: joshin4colours: Marionette's an implementation of the W3C WebDriver protocol, so not entirely the same.
[2014-12-29 08:14:47] ato: joshin4colours: It aims to one day replace FirefoxDriver however, so in that sense it's similar to Google's chromedriver.
[2014-12-29 08:14:52] jimevans: joshin4colours: more like chromedriver, in that it's developed and maintained by mozilla.

[2014-12-29 13:32:47] ato: The plural method, find_elementS_by_xpath returns a sequence, a list, of web elements.
[2014-12-29 13:33:07] ato: You can use the single version to only get the first result, or call [0] to get the first item on the list.

[2014-12-29 13:34:27] ato: You can tell by the brackets: […].
[2014-12-29 13:34:45] ato: Try browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a")
[2014-12-29 13:34:54] ato: That will fetch the first a element in the document.

[2014-12-29 13:36:45] ato: So.
[2014-12-29 13:37:10] ato: There are two important concepts: WebDriver, which is the representation of the browser, and WebElement, which are individual elements in the document.

[2014-12-29 13:46:14] Neko`: but selenium is a bit complicated for me :/
[2014-12-29 13:46:41] ato: Neko`: Since the a element there isn't uniquely identifiable you need to find a selector that is.
[2014-12-29 13:47:00] ato: For example find_element_by_css_selector("#lien_ep > a") should work in this case.
[2014-12-29 13:47:26] ato: That will get the immediate a element inside the element #lien_ep.

[2014-12-29 13:56:35] jimevans: no, you retrieved the link using find_element.
[2014-12-29 13:56:42] jimevans: you stored it in the variable link.
