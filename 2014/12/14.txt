[2014-12-14 21:54:25] Arven: Savi: IIRC, you won't be able to test an embedded browser, but you can test it in a standard browser. I.e. if you're embedding WebKit you can test with Chromium

[2014-12-14 22:12:44] Arven: Savi: To what extend does the application require the embedded browser to function?

[2014-12-14 22:17:32] Savi: Like chrome launcher application example
[2014-12-14 22:17:54] Savi: once that browser opens then u pass respective url to it
