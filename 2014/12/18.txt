[2014-12-18 05:00:48] roberto_: I'm using a Firefox node on the Selenium hub but the tests are taking much longer than testing locally

[2014-12-18 05:31:38] roberto_: The issue doesn't seam to be docker specific, just around a firefox node on the selenium hub/grid
[2014-12-18 05:32:05] Dave_B_: it'll always be a bit slower due to messaging overhead
[2014-12-18 05:32:28] Dave_B_: but you should be able to run lots in parallel more than making up for it
[2014-12-18 05:35:28] roberto_: Hi dave, well right now its just one test, on one website. Would more instances be of benifit here?
[2014-12-18 05:36:16] ratem, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-12-18 05:37:49] Dave_B_: nope :(
[2014-12-18 05:39:19] roberto_: some context - local machine is Linux, running the tests using a chrome driver. Remotely its a Linux box, running the selenium hub container, with a firefox node container conntected to it(docker is one of the best tools i've ever used)
[2014-12-18 05:40:57] roberto_: I'm just stumped as to the lenght the test takes to run on the hub, from the logs of the firefox node, it looks to be waiting a long time for pages to load, I am on a corp network but still the node it getting access to the network, and web pages
[2014-12-18 05:41:54] Dave_B_: long page waits on nodes can be a pain to diagnose :(
[2014-12-18 05:42:18] Dave_B_: normally I find random tracking pixels or similar are throwing a spanner in the works
[2014-12-18 05:42:27] Dave_B_: but I've not found a general pattern :(
[2014-12-18 05:42:41] Dave_B_: I assume the docker node is using some kind of virtual frame buffer?
[2014-12-18 05:44:32] Dave_B_, changing nick to Dave_B_afk.
[2014-12-18 05:45:47] roberto_: I have no idea how the firefox docker node operates, I just send it capibilities and cross my fingers
[2014-12-18 05:47:25] roberto_: I know you can connect to the node via VNC to see it visually but don't see the point as I'm tracking the logs, and page waits are the issue. FYI, the website im testing is super crap but still testible
[2014-12-18 05:47:59] roberto_: I do wonder if I'm missing a important capibility
[2014-12-18 05:48:51] roberto_: can you explain the tracking pixels thing?

[2014-12-18 12:47:29] GBGRPN: Hi. Is there any documentation for how to add Java dependencies for Selenium Server? I'm not sure how to work with CrazyFun.
[2014-12-18 12:49:52] dimacus: that's greg ^^ he is trying to add jmx jar dependency to grid hub, not sure what needs to be done since i've never added a dependency before
[2014-12-18 12:50:32] dimacus: barancev|2: do you have a min to help him?
[2014-12-18 12:51:01] ato: GBGRPN: The dependencies are defined in build.desc files.  They are separate from those of the IDEs.
[2014-12-18 12:51:40] ato: jimevans: You can't blame Marionette for not trying hard enough: JavascriptException: JavascriptException: JavaScriptError: Error: Permission denied to access property 'document'
[2014-12-18 12:52:17] dimacus: GBGRPN: can you give a more specific detail on where things break for you?
[2014-12-18 12:52:18] jimevans: saw that on twitter. :)
[2014-12-18 12:52:35] ato: GBGRPN: Typically the dependencies themselves need a build.desc file in /third_party/java.
[2014-12-18 12:52:44] GBGRPN: Ok. I've added what I think is right to a few files. Let me type them out.
[2014-12-18 12:52:59] GBGRPN:  /java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/common/build.desc
[2014-12-18 12:53:11] GBGRPN: maven/server/pom.xml
[2014-12-18 12:53:18] GBGRPN: third_party/java/jmxutils/BUCK b/third_party/java/jmxutils/BUCK
[2014-12-18 12:53:37] dimacus: i don't think you need the BUCK file
[2014-12-18 12:53:47] GBGRPN: third_party/java/jmxutils/BUCK b/third_party/java/jmxutils/build.desc
[2014-12-18 12:53:53] ato: The BUCK files are for a separate in-progress build system.
[2014-12-18 12:53:56] GBGRPN: ok
[2014-12-18 12:53:56] ato: You shouldn't worry about those.
[2014-12-18 12:54:05] ato: (See the README.md for a description.)

[2014-12-18 12:54:23] ato: But yeah, that doesn't look too bad.
[2014-12-18 12:54:37] ato: Before making a PR you will probably also want to update the classpath for the IDEs.
[2014-12-18 12:54:41] GBGRPN: Each of those I modified based on the files in the guava directory
[2014-12-18 12:55:03] GBGRPN: Is there an automated way to do that or is that manual?
[2014-12-18 12:55:34] ato: It's all manual I'm afraid.
[2014-12-18 12:55:50] ato: Welcome to the world of Java (-:
[2014-12-18 12:55:52] klrmn, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-12-18 12:56:08] GBGRPN: Ok. So just import from the third_party directory? Which IDEs are supported? Eclipse and Intellij?
[2014-12-18 12:56:16] ato: That's right.
[2014-12-18 12:56:42] GBGRPN: ok. Cool. I'll give this a shot.
[2014-12-18 12:56:45] GBGRPN: Thanks for your help!
[2014-12-18 12:56:56] ato: You're looking for /java/server/server.iml and /java/server/.classpath respectively.

[2014-12-18 14:59:40] AutomatedTester: lukeis: is there a way to make the tabs in the inbox filter on what I tell it
[2014-12-18 14:59:56] AutomatedTester: instead of the auto filtering it does (and does badly)
[2014-12-18 15:00:13] lukeis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
