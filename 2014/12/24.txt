[2014-12-24 08:12:41] erichf: @mtscout6 my tests are running extremely slow
[2014-12-24 08:13:05] mtscout6: More context please...
[2014-12-24 08:13:21] erichf: incoming, one sec
[2014-12-24 08:14:57] erichf: Does anyone have an idea as to why? Running on AWS, Running the docker node and hub containers locally. I'm watching the nodes with VNC, pages are taking like 40-50 seconds to load, I'm tailing the logs of the node and hub and both seem to just wait for 30-40 seconds b/t commands
[2014-12-24 08:15:58] mtscout6: Are you saying that the site you are testing is on AWS and the docker containers are on your machine?
[2014-12-24 08:16:21] mtscout6: Have you looked at the logs of the website you are testing.
[2014-12-24 08:16:40] erichf: The site I am testing is actually hosted on the same EC2 instance (local tomcat instance)
[2014-12-24 08:17:38] mtscout6: So you are running the docker containers in AWS?
[2014-12-24 08:18:27] erichf: Yes, the CI instance contains: tomcat, 1-4 docker nodes, and 1 hub
[2014-12-24 08:20:14] mtscout6: Ok, then you are not running anything locally, do they perform better when you run them locally? Or what are you comparing it against?
[2014-12-24 08:20:40] erichf: Yes, much much faster when run on my personal computer
[2014-12-24 08:21:22] mtscout6: What is the difference is hardware/OS specs between the two?
[2014-12-24 08:23:40] erichf: m3.xlarge	4 CPU	15 GB RAM	2 x 40 SSD
[2014-12-24 08:23:56] mtscout6: And your machine?
[2014-12-24 08:24:06] erichf: personal computer i7 quad (something) 16GB RAM 80 GB SSD
[2014-12-24 08:24:45] mtscout6: Sounds like you may be CPU constrained then, since you are running with half the CPU cores
[2014-12-24 08:26:09] erichf: How so? isn't 4 CPUs the same number of cores as my i7 ?
[2014-12-24 08:26:35] mtscout6: i7 does hyper threading essentially giving you 8 cores
[2014-12-24 08:26:53] erichf: interesting
[2014-12-24 08:27:05] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 844
[2014-12-24 08:27:29] mtscout6: Check your CPU usage on your AWS instance my guess is that the CPU is pegged pretty hard
[2014-12-24 08:31:57] erichf: I thought I checked yesterday with `top` command, AWS, docker hub, and docker node -- all were less than 5% usage. Total RAM usage was 6 GB max
[2014-12-24 08:32:15] erichf: Although, I must admit I'm not too savvy with analyzing performance

[2014-12-24 08:37:29] erichf: I'm wondering if running everything on one host is AWS the issue
[2014-12-24 08:37:40] erichf: I'm wondering if running everything on one host in AWS is the issue*
[2014-12-24 08:44:14] mtscout6: It very well could be. I am confident that this is not an issue with the docker selenium containers themselves
