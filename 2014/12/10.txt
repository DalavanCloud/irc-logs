[2014-12-10 08:02:09] cmosguy: I seem to be having difficulties executing jquery command in selenium.  For example, if I do: [execute script: return $('*:contains("Logout")').children().length >0;, []]) it returns nothing
[2014-12-10 08:02:24] WhereIsMySpoon: cmosguy: you cant execute jquery in selenium without explicitly including it in the dom
[2014-12-10 08:02:38] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, it is included in the application
[2014-12-10 08:02:44] WhereIsMySpoon: so you'd need to make a script element with document.createElement and append it to the dom, then run your jquery
[2014-12-10 08:02:47] WhereIsMySpoon: doesnt matter
[2014-12-10 08:02:54] Dave_B_: seen so many libraries that turn nice elegant calls into horrible repeat lookups with automatic lookup type switching, re-looking up on exceptions etc that make it a pig to debug all in the interests of making it 'easier'

[2014-12-10 08:04:30] WhereIsMySpoon: just in general use vanilla js
[2014-12-10 08:04:33] cmosguy: i am trying to test a Ember web app, and it is basically a single-page app, the Xpath find function cannot find my dynamic elements
[2014-12-10 08:04:37] WhereIsMySpoon: and try to not use the js executor at all
[2014-12-10 08:04:56] WhereIsMySpoon: cmosguy: did you try the css selector or any of the other ones?
[2014-12-10 08:05:31] jimevans: ato: according to its docs, it's based on selenium core.
[2014-12-10 08:05:43] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, no i haven't tried css selector, are your referring to css selectors using Xpath?
[2014-12-10 08:05:55] WhereIsMySpoon: no, im referring to querySelector which the css selector in selenium uses
[2014-12-10 08:06:01] cmosguy: dimacus, ok trying to use Jquery instead of $
[2014-12-10 08:06:30] WhereIsMySpoon: i think its jQuery not Jquery

[2014-12-10 08:07:53] dimacus: that's how i check if jQuery is availalble on the page
[2014-12-10 08:08:44] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, what do you mean don't use php bindings?
[2014-12-10 08:09:16] WhereIsMySpoon: there are about 6 different sets of bindings, none of which are updated often and none of which the php selenium guys can agree on which to use
[2014-12-10 08:09:24] jimevans: ato: okay. it's been awhile since i looked at tellurium. yeah, it's trolling.
[2014-12-10 08:09:25] WhereIsMySpoon: they arent official
[2014-12-10 08:10:57] cmosguy: people dimacus thanks
[2014-12-10 08:11:14] jimevans: ato: because while it started as a wrapper around selenium core/rc, they've now decided to go their own way and create their own engine. it's still based on selenium at the moment, but that's going away as soon as they can get a handle on it. i see nowhere that they've considered using webdriver as a basis.
[2014-12-10 08:11:36] jimevans: which, of course, means that their open source team is massively reinventing the wheel.
[2014-12-10 08:11:48] jimevans: doing things that browser vendors are/will be doing.
[2014-12-10 08:11:59] jimevans: but if that's the way they want to spend their time, more power to them.
[2014-12-10 08:12:01] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, do you know anything about Content Security Policy?
[2014-12-10 08:12:13] cmosguy: could that stop my selenium from injecting jquery commands?

[2014-12-10 08:16:09] cmosguy: Done: [execute script: return typeof jQuery == 'function';, []]
[2014-12-10 08:16:14] jimevans: just about the only thing i like about it over selenium is that it can use the Syn event library for synthetic events. https://github.com/bitovi/syn
[2014-12-10 08:16:30] jimevans: there's no reason whatsoever for us to be maintaining our own synthetic event library.
[2014-12-10 08:17:02] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, so you recommend doing something document.createElement for jquery?
[2014-12-10 08:17:16] ato: jimevans: That's a good point.
[2014-12-10 08:17:25] cmosguy: i guess the jquery is all wrapped in my es6

[2014-12-10 08:19:58] jimevans: ato: unfortunately, my javascript expertise is rusty enough that i can't easily strip out the existing atoms bits for interactions to replace them. plus no time, but that's a more bogus excuse.
[2014-12-10 08:20:18] cmosguy: WhereIsMySpoon, ok, can you point me to a doc somewhere that can explain how i should be doing it?

[2014-12-10 08:24:25] cmosguy: i know
[2014-12-10 08:24:45] cmosguy: but it doesn't work for some reason when i have to wait for the page to dynamically change
[2014-12-10 08:25:27] WhereIsMySpoon: cmosguy: maybe it would help if you explained exactly what the sequence of events are that you're trying to test against

I was trying role=xxxx but when a script attempts to select the role, the grid selects a machine in an seemingly random order
[2014-12-10 10:55:03] Guest38792: If I limit based on browser or platform, these attributes are respected by the grid

[2014-12-10 10:55:23] dimacus: Guest38792: not sure if that's the solution you want, but you can write your own "CapabilityMatcher" and have that guy choose which node picks up which test… such as Test 1 only goes to Node 1
[2014-12-10 10:56:35] Guest38792: That sounds sort like what I was after, basically blocking scripts from accessing given nodes unless they're give the right "key" ... so what's a CapabilityMatcher?  A java class or something?

[2014-12-10 13:17:30] mtscout6: eric: I did push a change last week that change a timeout from 5 minutes to 30 seconds. Can you try removing your images and re-pulling them?
[2014-12-10 13:19:12] eric___: I install docker via puppet on new EC2 instances automatically; thus they should be pulling down the latest versions everytime a new instance is started
[2014-12-10 13:19:23] eric___: and we start new instances a lot
[2014-12-10 13:19:36] eric___: anyway to figure out which version of the image im using?
[2014-12-10 13:21:03] CSWookie: jleyba: Since I'd rather this not be firefox 15 specific, feel free to give me an answer suited to a browser that IS within the support window, and if it doesn't work, I'll not blame you.  Assuming there is a solution to my problem.

[2014-12-10 13:22:07] CSWookie: I know I can say el1 == el2, and it'll check if they both refer to the same element.  Will it also check if they are displayed?
[2014-12-10 13:22:29] jleyba: Well have you tried a recent version of Firefox? We support ESR-1, ESR, N-1, and N. Right now that is 24, 31, 33, and 34.
[2014-12-10 13:23:16] eric___: CSWookie: Can you find the parent element and then findElements() to see if the child element is there?
[2014-12-10 13:23:31] CSWookie: jleyba: Can't right now.  There are other things preventing that.
[2014-12-10 13:24:02] mtscout6: eric run docker images and look at the image hash id.
[2014-12-10 13:24:36] CSWookie: eric___: I could, but I'm worried that'll cause it to check each node to see if it's displayed.  Which is slow.
[2014-12-10 13:26:11] jleyba: "I know I can say el1 == el2, and it'll check if they both refer to the same element.  Will it also check if they are displayed?"

[2014-12-10 13:38:07] _cmosguy_: hi all, I have an xpath command where i am trying to click on a link, how can i debug this directly in the browswer?  here is the selenium command:  Done: [find elements: By.xpath: //html/.//a[./@href][(((./@id = 'Logout' or contains(normalize-space(string(.)), 'Logout')) or contains(./@title, 'Logout') or contains(./@rel, 'Logout')) or .//img[contains(./@alt, 'Logout')])] | .//*[./@role = 'link'][((./@id = 'Logout' or contains(./@value,
[2014-12-10 13:38:07] _cmosguy_: 'Logout')) or contains(./@title, 'Logout') or contains(normalize-space(string(.)), 'Logout'))]]
[2014-12-10 13:38:11] _cmosguy_: but how can i debug this?
[2014-12-10 13:38:37] _cmosguy_: the problem that i am having is the link exists, but the xpath can't find it in my single page web app
[2014-12-10 13:38:39] CSWookie: jleyba: walk the tree.
[2014-12-10 13:38:56] CSWookie: But I don't think that solution would work anyway.
[2014-12-10 13:40:14] CSWookie: _cmosguy_: I'd open the page in Chrome and use the console.  $x('path') will execute the path for you and you can see what it finds.
[2014-12-10 13:40:30] _cmosguy_: CSWookie, but when i paste in that line
[2014-12-10 13:40:35] _cmosguy_: it breaks i tried that
[2014-12-10 13:40:56] CSWookie: _cmosguy_: Are you in a frameset?
[2014-12-10 13:41:12] _cmosguy_: Frameset?
[2014-12-10 13:41:31] CSWookie: _cmosguy_: Does your page use frames?
[2014-12-10 13:41:40] _cmosguy_: no
[2014-12-10 13:42:15] CSWookie: Also, that xpath is gross.
[2014-12-10 13:42:51] _cmosguy_: CSWookie, i know
[2014-12-10 13:43:02] eric___: anyone know how to tell docker you only want part of the log file, not the whole thing?
[2014-12-10 13:43:02] _cmosguy_: it's what the behat/selnium2 driver keeps putting
[2014-12-10 13:43:09] _cmosguy_: is there a better xpath command?
[2014-12-10 13:43:27] _cmosguy_: to just find a link?
[2014-12-10 13:44:38] CSWookie: Depends on the link.  If you're only trying to find in your page, you should know whether it's a button or a link or has attributes or whathaveyou.
