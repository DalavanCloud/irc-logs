[2014-12-08 06:52:25] AutomatedTester: jiffe: currently FIrefoxDriver lives in an addon but at Mozilla we are using a different way to communicate with the browser allowing you to use Fennec and FirefoxOS
[2014-12-08 06:52:41] AutomatedTester: and FxOS doesnt or didnt allow addons
[2014-12-08 06:53:35] AutomatedTester: so we used devtools communications approach and so does chrome+chromeDriver and we need a server somewhere
[2014-12-08 06:53:57] AutomatedTester: since there is no standard transport layer between browsers for this type of thing

[2014-12-08 08:44:12] jimevans: so i've gotten asked by smartbear software (http://www.smartbear.com) what i thought about them sponsoring the project. i haven't replied yet.
[2014-12-08 08:44:46] *dimacus looks up definition of "sponsoring"'
[2014-12-08 08:45:19] jimevans: http://www.seleniumhq.org/sponsor/
[2014-12-08 08:45:27] ato: So I've been asked to give a talk about the future of Selenium, but just realised I don't really know much about it apart from that it would be beneficial for it to support the WebDriver specification at some point in the future.
[2014-12-08 08:47:13] jimevans: ato: what's the audience?
[2014-12-08 08:47:26] ato: Selenium users, I guess.
[2014-12-08 08:47:39] ato: My point is that most of the plan seem to exist only in the head of certain individuals.
[2014-12-08 08:48:11] jimevans: well, i mean, what's the venue? how you present that is different based on what the audience is and where you're presenting it.
[2014-12-08 08:48:47] jimevans: and if you've been asked, it seems that you should be giving your educated speculation.
[2014-12-08 08:48:48] jimevans: :)
[2014-12-08 08:49:31] ato: This seems like excellent reasons to cancel. d-:
[2014-12-08 08:50:18] jimevans: it took a long time for me to realize that people in the selenium community are sometimes actually interested in what i have to say. you might do well to internalize that same realization :)

[2014-12-08 09:24:01] jimevans: ugh. why is there a LoggingPreferences object in capabilities?
[2014-12-08 09:24:33] ato: It's this idea that you can nest capabilities.
[2014-12-08 09:24:36] ato: We talked about it at the last WG.
[2014-12-08 09:24:52] jimevans: yeah, but i'm not sure it should be an object.
[2014-12-08 09:25:15] jimevans: seems heavyweight rather than just using a simple value.
[2014-12-08 09:25:25] ato: Maybe I'm not clear on what you mean.
[2014-12-08 09:25:26] jimevans: especially since the object is specified to only have one property.
[2014-12-08 09:25:35] ato: Are you talking about anything language specific?
[2014-12-08 09:25:41] jimevans: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#JSON_object
[2014-12-08 09:25:57] jimevans: ato: ^^
[2014-12-08 09:26:12] jimevans: the construct is apparently used by chromedriver.
[2014-12-08 09:26:51] jimevans: so again i say, ugh.
[2014-12-08 09:27:17] jimevans: hate that we had to punt logging to level 2
[2014-12-08 09:28:07] ato: I think there's something missing here.
[2014-12-08 09:28:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: I hope you find it then
[2014-12-08 09:28:34] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-12-08 09:28:51] jimevans: it does seem a bit incomplete.
[2014-12-08 09:29:21] ato: I don't understand what's mean by the key “driver” in this case.
[2014-12-08 09:29:42] ato: It seems to allow {"loggingPrefs": {"something": "INFO"}}.
[2014-12-08 09:29:44] jimevans: ato now shares my confusion.
[2014-12-08 09:29:54] mheinke, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-08 09:30:25] ato: And it seems Firefox specific, which is odd because I was under the impression Chrome supported something similar.
[2014-12-08 09:30:42] jimevans: no, chrome supports it.
[2014-12-08 09:30:59] jimevans: see https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/capabilities
[2014-12-08 09:31:16] ato: I was just looking at that.
[2014-12-08 09:31:29] ato: So the idea here seems to be that you should be able to set the level of components inside the browser.
[2014-12-08 09:31:41] ato: Such as performance, driver, server, &c.
[2014-12-08 09:31:52] jimevans: i'm doing a periodic update to the .NET bindings to support type safe versions of chrome's supported capabilities, and i hit this.
[2014-12-08 09:32:22] ato: But then why isn't the value of loggingPrefs an array?
[2014-12-08 09:32:59] ato: Sounds like you need to look at some chromedriver code, my friend.
[2014-12-08 09:33:27] jimevans: i was really hoping i wouldn't have to. i don't have the time for that little bit of spelunking today. maybe later in the week.
[2014-12-08 09:34:02] ato: What does LoggingPreferences.enable do?
[2014-12-08 09:34:14] jimevans: anyway, i think your original assessment was correct, that the loggingPrefs object would support levels for components within a driver.
[2014-12-08 09:35:04] ato: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/76358a4ddc82200bab6302950406eb0470cc1298/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/logging/LoggingPreferences.java

[2014-12-08 09:35:35] ato: So it's using a HashSet, which in JSON terms is an array.
[2014-12-08 09:35:36] jimevans: like {"loggingPrefs": {"driver": "INFO", "server": "OFF", "browser": "FINE"} }
[2014-12-08 09:35:39] merobertsjr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-08 09:35:43] ato: Oh yeah.
[2014-12-08 09:36:01] ato: So the docs are not totally correct then.
[2014-12-08 09:36:08] jimevans: but it's mis-documented in the wiki.
[2014-12-08 09:36:41] ato: I can fix it.
[2014-12-08 09:36:50] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 812
[2014-12-08 09:37:10] jimevans: i'd edit the doc, but i don't fully understand what the intended behavior is. i *think* i know it, but i'm not sure.
[2014-12-08 09:37:21] ato: I think what you think is correct.
[2014-12-08 09:37:24] jimevans: and my head hurts to badly today to try to suss it out further.
[2014-12-08 09:37:39] ato: Since Java's using a HashSet, that converts to a JSON object like you said.
[2014-12-08 09:38:44] ato: (It's a terrible API this BTW.)
[2014-12-08 09:38:46] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-08 09:38:49] jimevans: i've been *so* avoiding the logging api in the .NET bindings for that reason.
[2014-12-08 09:39:36] ato: The logging API was a result of a Google intern doing iterations on it like crazy a few years back without talking to anyone and landing it directly in the tree with some googler's permission.
[2014-12-08 09:39:37] mdas, joining. (#selenium)

[2014-12-08 09:39:49] jimevans: simonstewart has been promising me he's going to look at it and refine it for ages, but of course, with life and demands on his time being what they are, it's not yet happened
[2014-12-08 09:40:01] ato: I'd be wary of changing it now.

[2014-12-08 09:40:20] ato: Better to leave it for a spec extension I think.
[2014-12-08 09:40:31] jimevans: level 2, my friend.
[2014-12-08 09:40:36] jimevans: it's on the list already.
[2014-12-08 09:40:55] ato: Yeah.  It's not clear to me if we want to have one generic “level 2” thing or individual feature extensions though.
[2014-12-08 09:41:01] ato: I think we should have that discussion.

[2014-12-08 09:47:16] ato: Exactly.
[2014-12-08 09:47:26] ato: I think very much it's a case of “was”.

[2014-12-08 10:05:29] ato: dimacus: That's a Java specific API.

[2014-12-08 10:05:44] ato: dimacus: It will ask FirefoxDriver for the list of available cookies.
[2014-12-08 10:05:51] Dave_B_: nor mine WhereIsMySpoon :)
[2014-12-08 10:06:03] ato: dimacus: Then the Java bindings handle what happens when a cookie is missing from that list.

[2014-12-08 10:07:18] dimacus: ato: ok let me dig into java api then, just curious what FirefoxDriver does, does it return a null or an empty string, or an error if a cookie is not there
[2014-12-08 10:07:33] ato: You don't ask for a cookie with a sepcific name.
[2014-12-08 10:07:41] ato: You ask for a list of cookies, and FirefoxDriver will return what it sees.

[2014-12-08 10:09:05] dimacus: it's happening in java binding, cool that helps
[2014-12-08 10:09:52] jimevans: yeah, if the cookie isn't there, it should return null.
[2014-12-08 10:10:02] ato: I believe we even have a test for this!
[2014-12-08 10:10:51] jleyba, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-08 10:12:43] dimacus: yeah i just remeber a behaviour in ruby driver, where if you are doing a positive look up for an element that does not exist
[2014-12-08 10:13:00] dimacus: the driver would sit until it hits a timeout, waiting until the element becomes visible
[2014-12-08 10:13:28] dimacus: which was very in-efficient, it was better to look up all elements, and check if the element you want is there, instead of doing a find_element that you know won't be there
[2014-12-08 10:13:36] dimacus: or to do a negative element look up
[2014-12-08 10:13:54] dimacus: so was wondering if s similar thing happens in java </context>
[2014-12-08 10:14:02] ato: That should only happen if you set the implicit wait interval.
[2014-12-08 10:14:23] ato: In the context of positively looking up elements and waiting for them to appear.
[2014-12-08 10:15:02] dimacus: good point
[2014-12-08 10:15:08] dimacus: TIL something useful each day
[2014-12-08 10:15:09] ato: The implicit wait only affects element lookup.

[2014-12-08 11:32:30] lukeis: yay… i haven't looked at the code, but I could try an implementation based on what you said :)

[2014-12-08 11:34:06] dimacus: dunpeal: wow super odd
[2014-12-08 11:34:10] ato: lukeis: The basic idea is that we provide an alternate implementation of time.sleep which increases a counter instead of actually sleeping.
[2014-12-08 11:35:00] ato: It was a digression, but interesting in the context of why I think it's a bad idea to use freezegun or whatever when the sleeps really are bugs in our code which should be fixed.
[2014-12-08 11:35:00] lukeis: oh, i was going to try to provide a mechanism for which someone could swap out time.sleep
[2014-12-08 11:36:28] ato: Like the fact that our chrome startup code needs sleeps is terrifying.

[2014-12-08 11:41:41] ato: I've already bitched enough about why I think the way it's implemented is stupid.
[2014-12-08 11:41:56] ato: I'll go eat a cookie.
[2014-12-08 11:42:29] barancev: the opera browser or the opera driver?
[2014-12-08 11:42:54] ato: The driver.
[2014-12-08 11:43:24] jimevans: i still don't understand why stock chromedriver won't work with blinkopera, but whatever.
[2014-12-08 11:43:27] barancev: I thought it is a slightly modifies chromedriver
[2014-12-08 11:43:34] barancev: *modified
[2014-12-08 11:44:13] ato: There wouldn't need to be a change in Selenium (well only very minor) if Opera had talked to the Chrome people before going ahead with wrapping chromedriver so that users now need to download two separate binaries to test on what is, essentially, the same engine.
[2014-12-08 11:44:23] ato: jimevans: Exactly my point.
[2014-12-08 11:45:03] jimevans: ato: yes, but then, you and i have discussed this at length before. :)
[2014-12-08 11:45:18] barancev: yes, it is suboptimal
[2014-12-08 11:46:36] ato: I also had a lengthy conversation with the implentor at Opera about this by email, and they agreed with me on this, but said that they couldn't justify the time to involve the Chrome people in the discussion so chose the brute force method instead.
[2014-12-08 11:46:52] ato: (My interpretation of the facts given about time constraints.)
[2014-12-08 11:47:45] jimevans: it's cheaper time-wise to implement (and monitor, and maintain, and continually update) it yourself than talk to someone?!?!

[2014-12-08 11:51:00] lukeis: more like… lolwat?
[2014-12-08 11:51:20] ato: Well, they'll do minor releases and bug fixes, but they'll be focussing on rebuilding the product.
[2014-12-08 11:51:47] jimevans: what are the odds that desktop marionette will get some attention?
[2014-12-08 11:51:49] *jimevans ducks'
[2014-12-08 11:52:01] davehunt: jimevans: that has to be released now
[2014-12-08 11:52:10] davehunt: because of electrolysis
[2014-12-08 11:52:13] ato: They don't feel it's properly exploiting all the nice things you can do _only_ on web in a mobile OS.
[2014-12-08 11:52:19] ato: Which is an interesting thought exercise.
[2014-12-08 11:52:35] jimevans: davehunt: i must've missed something.
[2014-12-08 11:52:50] ato: davehunt: Marionette 1.0 is _a lot_ more than e10s.
[2014-12-08 11:53:04] davehunt: that's the per process tabs, and Firefox driver does not work with e10s
[2014-12-08 11:53:11] davehunt: so we have to get Marionette sorted
[2014-12-08 11:53:29] ato: Has it been decided which release target e10s will be in?
[2014-12-08 11:53:46] davehunt: ato: I know, but if we don't get Marionette out before e10s drops, Selenium is in trouble at least for Fx testers
[2014-12-08 11:53:56] davehunt: ato: yep, like 36/37?
[2014-12-08 11:54:08] davehunt: It's turned on by default in Nightly now
[2014-12-08 11:54:11] jimevans: well, that makes me happy-ish.
[2014-12-08 11:54:25] ato: OK, Firefox is in bigger trouble than just with FirefoxDriver if that's the case.
[2014-12-08 11:54:28] jimevans: i'm all for anything that pushes marionette 1.0 toward completion.
[2014-12-08 11:54:37] ato: Because e10s sucks pretty badly.
[2014-12-08 11:55:00] davehunt: ato: what issues have you seen with e10s?
[2014-12-08 11:55:07] ato: That it doesn't work? (-:
[2014-12-08 11:55:20] davehunt: I'm sure FirefoxDriver could be fixed, but I don't see that it's worth doing
[2014-12-08 11:55:24] davehunt: ato: it works for me
[2014-12-08 11:55:31] ato: With multiple windows?
[2014-12-08 11:55:33] ato: And not crashing?
[2014-12-08 11:55:45] davehunt: ato: I don't tend to use multiple windows
[2014-12-08 11:56:09] davehunt: but multiple tabs works fine for me.. I had a few addon issues early on
[2014-12-08 11:56:23] ato: Sad for us who use the ancient concept of windows then.
[2014-12-08 11:57:04] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 812
[2014-12-08 11:57:19] davehunt: hah, well I'm guessing you've raised the bug and someone will work on it :P
[2014-12-08 11:57:39] ato: I did raise a few bugs, I should look up the status on those.
[2014-12-08 11:57:45] AutomatedTester: ato: I use multiple windows and tabs but I tend to have more stable use of browsers than others
[2014-12-08 11:57:48] davehunt: also, that will likely affect the Mozmill tests that are going to be converted too, they test multiple windows
[2014-12-08 11:57:52] AutomatedTester: obviously dont look at enough cats
[2014-12-08 11:58:13] AutomatedTester: tbh I am finding aurora flakey atm
[2014-12-08 11:58:32] ato: AutomatedTester: Last time I tried, which is admittedly a few weeks ago now, dragging a tab from one window to another was fundamentally broken and messed up your session from that point on.
[2014-12-08 11:59:07] ato: I should try again.
[2014-12-08 11:59:19] ato: Now that Mozlandia isn't a thing anymore.
[2014-12-08 12:02:02] AutomatedTester: my biggest pain with e10s is speed
[2014-12-08 12:03:13] ato: I just tried it now, and it takes about 30 seconds to load twitter.com when dragging it from the other window.
[2014-12-08 12:03:24] ato: I don't understand why it has to reload the page.
[2014-12-08 12:03:42] ato: But it seems more stable, in the sense that it doesn't mess up my session.
[2014-12-08 12:04:28] ato: OK, I think there's just something very broken about this.  The page seems loaded, but the spinner doesn't go away.
[2014-12-08 12:04:33] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-12-08 12:04:47] ato: I think it's having a hard time detecting when the browser's resources have been transferred to the other window.
[2014-12-08 12:05:27] ato: Oh and context clicking is broken.
