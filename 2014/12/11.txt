[2014-12-11 08:02:20] patarr: could anyone explain how the export function works in selenium IDE? If I export to java, it just produces some boilerplate. It's referring to <testcase>.class, but it does not generate that class file. Am I supposed to write that myself? In that case, why is this called an export of an existing test case created in selenium IDE?
[2014-12-11 08:03:09] eric___, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-11 08:03:37] AutomatedTester: patarr: a java compiler will create the .class file
[2014-12-11 08:04:04] patarr: AutomatedTester: you're saying if I include the relevant selenium jars, it will pick up the selenium test case file and create a java file out of that?
[2014-12-11 08:04:10] patarr: .class file*
[2014-12-11 08:04:17] wdj, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-11 08:05:10] AutomatedTester: the export will give you somehting you can the put into a java project, which you should put the selenium jars on the classpath, and then when you compile and run that project the necessary .class files are created
[2014-12-11 08:05:41] patarr: Aaah. That makes sense. So the testcase XML file will be converted. Neat! Thanks AutomatedTester
[2014-12-11 08:05:53] patarr: Will I be able to view the generated source file?
[2014-12-11 08:06:02] AutomatedTester: yes, it's just java
[2014-12-11 08:06:13] patarr: Very nice.
[2014-12-11 08:06:19] AutomatedTester: once it's complied then you wont be
[2014-12-11 08:06:27] AutomatedTester: since that will be bytecode
[2014-12-11 08:07:27] patarr: Right, but you said the build process will generate the relevant files. I noticed the export generated no java code relevant to the test case.
[2014-12-11 08:07:48] patarr: So when I build with selenium jars in the classpath, it will generate both test case java, and the class file?
[2014-12-11 08:08:01] AutomatedTester: no, just the class file
[2014-12-11 08:08:06] AutomatedTester: you need to give it the java file
[2014-12-11 08:08:23] patarr: So what is the purpose of the export to java functionality?
[2014-12-11 08:08:31] patarr: It generated like 7 lines of boilerplate java.
[2014-12-11 08:08:43] patarr: And then I have to rewrite the selenium test case in java myself?
[2014-12-11 08:08:45] AutomatedTester: so that you can run it easier in a ci

[2014-12-11 08:10:28] _pal_: and while I'm doing the easiest page title fetching, I'm getting warning - WARNING: Unimplemented behavior: #default#userdata
[2014-12-11 08:10:34] budrose, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-12-11 08:10:57] _pal_: to be specific, I'm doing this tutorial https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingStarted
[2014-12-11 08:11:48] patarr: AutomatedTester: but I guess my frustration with this is that I would export an export to be an export. If someone has the ability to create a test case with selenium in java code, they would also most likely be able to create the 7 java lines of boilerplate necessary to run it. My first assumption is when I specify an export to java, it would generate the test case into java code for me. :(
[2014-12-11 08:12:12] AutomatedTester: patarr: thats what it should be doing
[2014-12-11 08:12:18] AutomatedTester: it should give you java code
[2014-12-11 08:12:25] AutomatedTester: java needs to be compiled to run
[2014-12-11 08:12:27] patarr: AutomatedTester: hm. Then I believe I found a bug.
[2014-12-11 08:12:43] _pal_: warning seems to be from this method - com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.javascript.host.html.HTMLElement addBehavior
[2014-12-11 08:13:01] _pal_: does anyone know how to get rid of it? or is it normal while using htmlunit?
[2014-12-11 08:14:14] AutomatedTester: _pal_: not sure, don't use headless browsers

[2014-12-11 08:19:28] _pal_: didn't try virtual sessions yet, is it just like X :1 java NewTest?
[2014-12-11 08:19:59] patarr: never did it myself. But I believe it would accomplish what you're looking to do.
[2014-12-11 08:20:17] patarr: I think you'd just make it simpler for yourself to have machines with a window manager
[2014-12-11 08:20:41] patarr: and if a test fails, it might also be nice to remote X session in/ VNC in and see what happened and at what page it stopped.

[2014-12-11 09:18:57] barancev: so the failures could be caused by earlier atom changes
[2014-12-11 09:19:00] lukeis: that one is just a downstream trigger

[2014-12-11 09:20:59] jimevans: barancev: no.
[2014-12-11 09:21:08] jimevans: all of the failures involve finding by xpath.
[2014-12-11 09:21:27] barancev: ah, anyway, the sizzle lib was not updated
[2014-12-11 09:21:52] jimevans: sizzle isn't used except for IE6 and 7, if memory serves.

[2014-12-11 09:29:10] barancev: yes. the question is why atom tests are green?
[2014-12-11 09:29:13] jimevans: so something in the way our xpath lib didn't like the manipulation.
[2014-12-11 09:29:50] jimevans: i suspect i know, but i'm going to hold off commenting for a minute.
[2014-12-11 09:29:54] jimevans: to verify
[2014-12-11 09:29:59] barancev: ok
[2014-12-11 09:32:09] jimevans: nope. i'm wrong. so i'd have to dig through the code path a little deeper to figure out why atoms work, but the compiled javascript doesn't.
[2014-12-11 09:32:19] jimevans: (which also could be the problem, a closure compiler bug)
[2014-12-11 09:32:26] merobertsjr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-11 09:34:37] jimevans: ah. it could be limited to element.findElement (as opposed to driver.findElement)

[2014-12-11 09:38:10] jleyba: jimevans: what’s broken?
[2014-12-11 09:38:32] jimevans: finding by xpath in IE 9.
[2014-12-11 09:39:12] jleyba: have a reproducible case?
[2014-12-11 09:39:13] jimevans: current working theory is that it's related to barancev's work on supporting xpath namespaces.
[2014-12-11 09:39:25] jimevans: failing in :ci

[2014-12-11 09:39:28] jimevans: so yes.
[2014-12-11 09:39:30] barancev: jimevans: in emergency you can change here version 9 to 10 -- https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/atoms/locators/xpath.js#L109
[2014-12-11 09:39:48] barancev: IE10 seems to be ok
[2014-12-11 09:39:55] barancev: according to CI
[2014-12-11 09:40:39] barancev: let namespaces work in IE10+ only
[2014-12-11 09:41:25] barancev: but anyway it is interesting why atom tests are green, but compiled execulatble test are not
[2014-12-11 09:42:08] jimevans: i have another theory about that. let me check.

[2014-12-11 10:30:58] Khal: sorry
[2014-12-11 10:33:22] Khal: is it because chromdriver does not support to send_keys() to a react-select field?
[2014-12-11 10:33:58] jimevans: i don't know what a 'react-select' field is.
[2014-12-11 10:38:39] Khal: React-select is a Select control built with and for React
[2014-12-11 10:39:21] Khal: and React is a JS library for building user interfaces
[2014-12-11 10:39:31] jimevans: okay let me rephrase. i don't have any experience with the react toolkit. and i'm too lazy to investigate anything about it.
[2014-12-11 10:40:06] jimevans: but i suspect that however the element is created, it's using some kind of element that can't be focused for part of it.

[2014-12-11 10:52:08] jimevans: the key-sending and mouse-clicking mechanisms between firefox and chrome drivers are vastly different.

[2014-12-11 10:55:35] Khal: I'm not trying to compare both drivers, all I'm trying to say is, if it is an issue with the chrome driver, then I should give it a try with Firefox.... but apparently is not sending the keys with firefox driver either, so it could seem an issue with selenium I guess
[2014-12-11 10:56:58] jimevans: Khal: if the element you're sending keystrokes to doesn't accept keystrokes, no driver will be able to do that. my suspicion is that it's a collection of elements that are styled to look like a drop-down box, but that change (bringing other elements to the foreground and hiding others) when the thing is clicked on.
