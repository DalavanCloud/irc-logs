[2014-12-19 07:38:56] Dave_B_: that or perhaps a timing issue and the element isn't there yet when you try and locate it but has appeared moments later

[2014-12-19 07:47:19] Dave_B_: the id is always the same?
[2014-12-19 07:47:32] Dave_B_: and this is definitely in the DOM at the time it is looking for it?
[2014-12-19 07:47:43] Dave_B_: and not in any iframes?

[2014-12-19 07:50:07] AntonioRibeiro: then I decided to remove codeception from the variable
[2014-12-19 07:50:38] AntonioRibeiro: so database is frozen while I test this, but in codeception database is reset, so the ID changes

[2014-12-19 08:07:27] Dave_B_: you could do something like css: [id^='reply-message-button']
[2014-12-19 08:07:45] Dave_B_: so if that turns out to be a dynamic id then it won't be killing you
[2014-12-19 08:07:52] AntonioRibeiro: Dave_B_: I can have many messages in the same page

[2014-12-19 08:08:04] dimacus: isn't the # in WebDriverBy::id("# redundant?
[2014-12-19 08:08:06] Dave_B_: oh, your idâ€¦. starts with a #?
[2014-12-19 08:08:11] Dave_B_: what he said^^
[2014-12-19 08:08:14] Dave_B_: ninja'd :(
[2014-12-19 08:08:22] dimacus: ninja'd?
[2014-12-19 08:08:30] Dave_B_: you answered while I was writing the same thing
[2014-12-19 08:08:58] *dimacus has cat like reflexes'
[2014-12-19 08:09:14] AntonioRibeiro: dimacus: no, you may be right, my id does not start with #, but Codeception asks me to add it, so I just added it wrongly
[2014-12-19 08:09:26] jimevans, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-12-19 08:09:41] dimacus: typically you will only use the # if you do a CSS locator strategy
[2014-12-19 08:09:50] dimacus: but you are explicitly declaring ID locator strategy
[2014-12-19 08:10:02] dimacus: so webdriver will assume that # is part of the id
[2014-12-19 08:11:29] dimacus: also, i'm new to PHP but is this the corerct way to concatonate a string? ".$message->id
[2014-12-19 08:11:33] AntonioRibeiro: yeah, but in codeception you can do $I->click('Name') $I->click('#name') and if it starts with # it will transform to WebDriverBy::id("name")
[2014-12-19 08:11:53] dimacus: do you need a space " . $message->id     ?
[2014-12-19 08:12:22] AntonioRibeiro: no, I dont
[2014-12-19 08:13:38] AntonioRibeiro: and yes . is for concat :)
[2014-12-19 08:13:46] dimacus: AntonioRibeiro: also, let's test 1 more thing, can you write to console the value of this expression
[2014-12-19 08:13:54] AntonioRibeiro: it should be +, I don't know why its .
[2014-12-19 08:14:01] dimacus: "#reply-message-button-".$message->id
[2014-12-19 08:14:35] AntonioRibeiro: console? no, because $message->id will be translated to a string
[2014-12-19 08:14:36] dimacus: i wonder if there is a formatting issue happening, where the button ID is not rendered into a proper string, or a null is there or who knows
[2014-12-19 08:14:40] dimacus: yeah
[2014-12-19 08:15:04] dimacus: i want to see what the whole search string looks like

[2014-12-19 09:12:36] lukeis: that basically is a 'simple' explicit wait
[2014-12-19 09:13:03] lukeis: the explicit waits in the selenium project sleep by default for 0.5 seconds between retriesâ€¦ and you can customize it

[2014-12-19 09:14:47] lukeis: i think that article was written before the python bindings had the explicit waitâ€¦ and they just haven't updated the page

[2014-12-19 13:15:23] CSWookie: Responsibility's on the parents.  I have a feeling the company wouldn't want to take the responsibility of an underaged employee getting some boozahol.  Bars serving to underaged customers get smackdown, I imagine it would be the same for a company with a tap.
