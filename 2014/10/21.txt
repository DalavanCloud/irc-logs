[2014-10-21 01:52:57] Dave_B_: as in your main window and the popup? (the popup has definitely opened? Do you need to wait for it at all?)
[2014-10-21 01:53:18] Sunny__: popup opens on a button click
[2014-10-21 01:53:31] Sunny__: it comes very fast so no need to wait

[2014-10-21 03:00:58] Dave_B_: if you're just looking to run against any browser then sure - but I imagine you're running IEDriver because you need to test in IE?

[2014-10-21 08:49:45] lukeis: ato: for that opera driver PRâ€¦ i may chime in tooâ€¦ but I really don't want something in our open source project for something that isn't publicly released
[2014-10-21 08:49:58] jimevans: CSWookie: you should already know what frame. your code switched to the frame, after all. :)
[2014-10-21 08:49:59] ato: lukeis: +1
[2014-10-21 08:50:18] ato: lukeis: Early review is good though.
[2014-10-21 08:50:41] lukeis: yesâ€¦ but certainly they can release it *before* we add the bindings
[2014-10-21 08:50:48] lukeis: RWD should work just fine
[2014-10-21 08:51:08] CSWookie: It takes input from the user.  The user may have logged out, or something, which would change the frames.
[2014-10-21 08:51:31] CSWookie: jimevans: Should I interpret your answer to mean, "there's no way to know"?
[2014-10-21 08:51:45] lukeis: you'll then get an exception about the frame no longer existing if you interact with it
[2014-10-21 08:51:55] lukeis: CSWookie: your code can certainly track that ;)
[2014-10-21 08:51:59] jimevans: CSWookie: no, the way to know is that somewhere in your code, someone called "switchTo.frame()" to switch frames.
[2014-10-21 08:52:16] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: hes saying that the website itself switches frames
[2014-10-21 08:52:28] WhereIsMySpoon: or removes frames
[2014-10-21 08:52:42] lukeis: webdriver will blow up if the frame you're on is removed
[2014-10-21 08:52:44] jimevans: code determinism ftw.
[2014-10-21 08:53:02] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: you should already know what actions result in frames being removed/added/moved
[2014-10-21 08:53:15] jimevans: you know (or should know) what you're automating. you know (or should know) the state of the application being automated.
[2014-10-21 08:53:23] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore, you should know that when you click that logout button or whatever button it is, that the frame you're talking about has changed
[2014-10-21 08:53:31] WhereIsMySpoon: yea, me and jim are saying the same thing :D
[2014-10-21 08:53:44] lukeis: unless you're trying to provide some abstract framework for people that "does what I mean" ;)
[2014-10-21 08:53:52] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium depends on a deterministic workflow
[2014-10-21 08:54:01] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm writing a frontend to selenium, so that folks that don't program can Type "Click the 'logout' button", and it does it.
[2014-10-21 08:54:10] *WhereIsMySpoon flees'
[2014-10-21 08:54:12] CSWookie: My front end doesn't know what site it's running on.
[2014-10-21 08:54:15] jimevans: so to answer your question more specifically, "webdriver is working on whatever the last frame you told it to focus on"
[2014-10-21 08:54:34] lukeis: with said framework you should then be tracking it
[2014-10-21 08:54:38] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: what jim said - webdriver will not switch frames if the one you *were* on was removed
[2014-10-21 08:54:40] jimevans: CSWookie: good luck with that.
[2014-10-21 08:54:50] WhereIsMySpoon: it will however throw an exception if you then try to operate on it
[2014-10-21 08:55:00] CSWookie: jimevans: But webdriver doesn't know what frame it is working on, that data is in the browser?
[2014-10-21 08:55:17] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt need to, you should know
[2014-10-21 08:55:44] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon:  I just explained why I don't.  OK.  I'll rely on the exception, then.
[2014-10-21 08:56:04] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: even if you're writing a wrapper you should still be able to tell if a frame is removed or w/e
[2014-10-21 08:56:07] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont see why you wouldnt
[2014-10-21 08:56:16] WhereIsMySpoon: say you're writing a wrapper over your login
[2014-10-21 08:56:19] *jimevans is firmly of the belief that web automation is a *programming task* and any attempts to hide that fact are doomed to failure.'
[2014-10-21 08:56:20] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon: Is there a way for me to say, "Stop focusing on frames".
[2014-10-21 08:56:27] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2014-10-21 08:56:33] *WhereIsMySpoon agrees with jim'
[2014-10-21 08:56:37] jimevans: CSWookie: switchTo().defaultContent() gets you back to the top level frame.\
[2014-10-21 08:56:58] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this is an answer to a different question
[2014-10-21 08:57:07] WhereIsMySpoon: but maybe its what you wanted :)
[2014-10-21 08:57:32] jimevans: i really really don't understand the appeal of "making it so that non-programmers can automate stuff".
[2014-10-21 08:57:36] CSWookie: It's a better answer than, "Don't do that."
[2014-10-21 08:57:49] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: short term $$$
[2014-10-21 08:58:01] WhereIsMySpoon: aka short sighted management
[2014-10-21 08:58:08] jimevans: i've been down that road.
[2014-10-21 08:58:15] jimevans: you end up with one of two things.
[2014-10-21 08:58:24] WhereIsMySpoon: all thats gonna happen is the users of this wrapper are going to just come back to you every time it doesnt work
[2014-10-21 08:58:36] WhereIsMySpoon: and it will be less useable and flexible than webdriver is
[2014-10-21 08:59:28] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-21 08:59:28] jimevans: either you end up generating code that's unmaintainable in the long run; or your tool ends up being so complex that you've ended up creating your own programming language, and you'd've been better off just ramping people up on how to code in the first place.
[2014-10-21 08:59:35] jimevans: i've never seen it end up any other way.
[2014-10-21 08:59:48] jimevans: i'm happy to be proven wrong someday.
[2014-10-21 08:59:49] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: my original point still stands though - say your login prompt is a frame, and pressing "login" removes the frame and loads the homepage. The non programmer user of your wrapper called something like "log into the site with user name blah and pw xxx" - you'll still know that the frame will be removed during this
[2014-10-21 09:00:07] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see how you would ever not be in control of the flow of the web page

[2014-10-21 09:05:34] CSWookie: No.  I've tested it with one site using complex workflows.
[2014-10-21 09:05:43] CSWookie: Like I said, "so far".
[2014-10-21 09:05:53] WhereIsMySpoon: it's working well so far for your specific case sure
[2014-10-21 09:06:07] WhereIsMySpoon: not so much with the site agnostic bit
[2014-10-21 09:06:32] CSWookie: However, I don't see any immediate reason why it wouldn't work for others.  WhereIsMySpoon, true about the agnostic bit.
[2014-10-21 09:06:51] CSWookie: But I'd rather design with that in mind as much as possible.
[2014-10-21 09:06:59] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: I didnt see any reason why my tests for one of our apps wouldnt work for the others to start
[2014-10-21 09:08:04] WhereIsMySpoon: I really think this whole exercise to turn the programming needed into a set of simplified instructions is either not going to work properly, or is going to create unstable or very slow test

[2014-10-21 09:29:21] WhereIsMySpoon: dont forget that root has completely different env setup than normal users
[2014-10-21 09:29:41] WhereIsMySpoon: path variables, etc...

[2014-10-21 09:30:43] patrickburns: Also, i just tried running it as my jenkins user, failed as well

[2014-10-21 09:31:28] patrickburns: lukeis, you got it.  just the output from running the jar file?
[2014-10-21 09:31:58] lukeis: sure :) and even after you start it can you attempt to hit  http://<host>:4444/wd/hub/status  ?
[2014-10-21 09:32:00] glloyd: dimacus:around 300 tests which crawl pages testing UI controls and looking for navigation and JS errors. Each of the 300 is a new window, done sequentially ATM.

[2014-10-21 09:32:29] glloyd: Dave_B_: yes the VM has a display
[2014-10-21 09:32:48] patrickburns: lukeis, ive tried browsing there but it 404's.  when i run it on my local mac i get the console page.  Also, on the remote server if i netstat after running the jar, there are no services listening on 4444
[2014-10-21 09:32:53] glloyd: dimacus: I was testing Firefox and IE8

[2014-10-21 09:33:31] lukeis: patrickburns: 404? huh? â€¦ maybe try starting on a different port thenâ€¦ -port 4545 ?

[2014-10-21 09:33:43] patrickburns: lukeis - unfortunately, ive tried that as well :(
[2014-10-21 09:33:50] WhereIsMySpoon: why does it say 4443
[2014-10-21 09:33:51] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-10-21 09:33:57] WhereIsMySpoon: it should be 4444 by default
[2014-10-21 09:33:58] patrickburns: ive tried both
[2014-10-21 09:34:00] patrickburns: both failed
[2014-10-21 09:34:02] lukeis: patrickburns:  because you are running on 4443?
[2014-10-21 09:34:21] dude-x: lukeis: are you taking the bacon this morning?
[2014-10-21 09:34:26] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: it's specified on the command line ;)
[2014-10-21 09:34:33] WhereIsMySpoon: oh sorry, cant see it
[2014-10-21 09:34:37] patrickburns: lukeis - artefact from testing, both 4444 and 4443 arent listening after running the jar file
[2014-10-21 09:34:42] lukeis: dude-x: maybe, likely, i dunno
[2014-10-21 09:34:51] dude-x: alright.
[2014-10-21 09:35:15] WhereIsMySpoon: patrickburns: ps ax and see if there are any selenium server processes running
[2014-10-21 09:35:21] WhereIsMySpoon: if so kill em and it should free the ports up
[2014-10-21 09:35:52] patrickburns: its not a port collision
[2014-10-21 09:36:38] patrickburns: The selenium server never gets to "Started SocketListener on 0.0.0.0:4444" the same way it does on my local machine

[2014-10-21 09:39:20] WhereIsMySpoon: patrickburns: is there maybe some proxy issue?
[2014-10-21 09:39:28] glloyd: dimacus:I found that the FindElement(s) calls infrequently can hang for 40-50s in FF and 50-60+s in IE. If i bypass the findelement by css selector and instead executeScript to call jQuery, then the issue mostly disappears. But only for calls directly from IWebDriver, some findelement calls on the framework I working on are on IWebElement

[2014-10-21 11:26:19] dude-x: py.test has a fixtures feature; that lets you set scope to run tests before the suite, before a module, before a class
[2014-10-21 11:26:20] jleyba: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#test-cases
[2014-10-21 11:26:33] dude-x: and to set the after, you can write finalizers
[2014-10-21 11:26:45] dude-x: and register multiple finalizers at a certain scope
[2014-10-21 11:27:27] dude-x: the built in unittest is somewhat more limited compared to nose or py.test, but it has a decent feature set
[2014-10-21 11:27:43] dude-x: python 3.4 unittest actually has some neatfeatures
