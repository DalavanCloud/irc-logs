[2014-10-17 03:46:12] smellyhippy: If I have a table which loads in pages of data via AJAX then would be waiting for the contents of the page navigation container element to change be the correct approach? I dont want to wait for the table elements contents to change as it's conceivable two pages could have the same content. Most google results suggest waiting for an element to appear, but page 1 means the elements are already
[2014-10-17 03:46:12] smellyhippy: visible. Is there a better approach I've totally missed?
[2014-10-17 03:49:17] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: so you have something like a tabbed webpage, where you click on a tab at the top and it loads a new paginated page (still the same actual web page though) which -could- have the same content
[2014-10-17 03:49:21] WhereIsMySpoon: right?
[2014-10-17 03:50:20] smellyhippy: same concept yep
[2014-10-17 03:51:07] smellyhippy: Specifically I have a table with X rows, and you can page between each X.
[2014-10-17 03:51:41] smellyhippy: so at the bottom, the page navigation "1,2,3" will change to allow/disallow navigation to cirtain pages.
[2014-10-17 03:51:53] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: what are you actually wanting to test
[2014-10-17 03:51:57] WhereIsMySpoon: that the pagination works?
[2014-10-17 03:52:28] smellyhippy: I want to read in the data to check that the data creation tests worked correctly.
[2014-10-17 03:53:03] WhereIsMySpoon: so make sure that the data you're feeding in isnt the same line repeated 100000 times?
[2014-10-17 03:53:26] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to test that your data creation tests feed the data properly to your paginated table, feed in different data
[2014-10-17 03:53:32] smellyhippy: I guess it goes both ways ... it shows the insert works and the pagination too, since we're checking expected vs actual.
[2014-10-17 03:54:34] WhereIsMySpoon: I really think this is two tests, as you can't both test that pagination works and that a particular piece of data you uploaded is there, as the particular data could be on a different page, and you need more than 1 page to test pagination
[2014-10-17 03:54:36] WhereIsMySpoon: so
[2014-10-17 03:54:47] smellyhippy: Why would it be preferable to watch the data elements rather than the navigation ones? I (probably nievly) see these as being the same, except one has a chance of failiure.
[2014-10-17 03:54:58] WhereIsMySpoon: test 1: upload 3 rows of data, check that some data from each row is present
[2014-10-17 03:55:39] WhereIsMySpoon: test 2: upload x pages of data (say 3) and check that your pagination works by clicking on page 1, 2, 3, checking that the clicked page number is bolded (I assume you have some way of knowing which page you're on) and that you have -some- content in the table
[2014-10-17 03:55:59] WhereIsMySpoon: doesnt have to be bolded ,its whatever is done to let people know that you're on x page
[2014-10-17 03:56:06] WhereIsMySpoon: bolded, coloured, w/e
[2014-10-17 03:56:45] smellyhippy: The navigation container contains a tags for the pages you can click on, and plain text for the page you can't.
[2014-10-17 03:57:03] smellyhippy: I wish it was bolded, that'd be nicer to watch for.
[2014-10-17 03:58:03] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: ok, so when you move to a page, the page number becomes not an <a> tag? or is the href attr just removed
[2014-10-17 03:58:11] WhereIsMySpoon: cause an <a> tag only looks blue when it has a href attr
[2014-10-17 03:58:20] smellyhippy: it becomes not an a.
[2014-10-17 03:58:30] WhereIsMySpoon: -sigh-
[2014-10-17 03:58:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-10-17 03:59:02] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: are all your page numbers in an element?
[2014-10-17 03:59:03] WhereIsMySpoon: a div or w/e
[2014-10-17 03:59:12] smellyhippy: I'll drop MS an email that thier control is shite after this project ;)
[2014-10-17 03:59:50] smellyhippy: <td colspan="8">1 <a data-swhglnk="true" href="X?page=2">2</a> <a data-swhglnk="true" href="X?page=2">&gt;</a> </td> <<< yuck
[2014-10-17 04:00:06] WhereIsMySpoon: nice
[2014-10-17 04:00:15] WhereIsMySpoon: so the page nums are just another torw
[2014-10-17 04:00:16] WhereIsMySpoon: row
[2014-10-17 04:00:19] WhereIsMySpoon: thats fucking stupid
[2014-10-17 04:00:31] smellyhippy: yep
[2014-10-17 04:00:38] smellyhippy: uhhh they're i nthe footer
[2014-10-17 04:00:44] smellyhippy: so it's not quite that stupid
[2014-10-17 04:01:05] WhereIsMySpoon: incidentally, http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#h-11.1
[2014-10-17 04:01:08] smellyhippy: thead/tbody/tfoot are used correctly.
[2014-10-17 04:01:16] WhereIsMySpoon: Tables should not be used purely as a means to layout document content as this may present problems when rendering to non-visual media.
[2014-10-17 04:01:25] WhereIsMySpoon: aaaaaaanyway
[2014-10-17 04:02:38] smellyhippy: I'm displaying a table of data ... in a table ...
[2014-10-17 04:02:51] smellyhippy: it's not for layout
[2014-10-17 04:03:16] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: ok so you have a class you can use, with a css selector '#tableid tfoot .data-swhglnk'
[2014-10-17 04:03:20] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[2014-10-17 04:03:28] WhereIsMySpoon: and use findElements
[2014-10-17 04:03:43] WhereIsMySpoon: if you're on page 2, and you have 5 pages, you should get back the elements for page 1, 3, 4 and 5
[2014-10-17 04:04:27] WhereIsMySpoon: so check that when you go to page 2, that the element for page 2 isnt there...etc
[2014-10-17 04:04:58] smellyhippy: Yeah, I already selecting everything from the header, body, and footer. I could impliment watching the content change right now. But the last two days have shown I can't assume the information I find is correct, hence me asking about the approach to use
[2014-10-17 04:05:00] WhereIsMySpoon: and if you want to be ultra safe you can also check that the text '2' -is- there in the td
[2014-10-17 04:05:22] smellyhippy: cool, I shall move forward ont ha tthen
[2014-10-17 04:05:23] WhereIsMySpoon: this would prolly be the approach id use
[2014-10-17 04:05:26] smellyhippy: *on that then
[2014-10-17 04:05:29] WhereIsMySpoon: with the info I have
[2014-10-17 04:05:46] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: disclaimer: that css selector may or may not work
[2014-10-17 04:05:48] WhereIsMySpoon: but you get the idea
[2014-10-17 04:06:29] smellyhippy: great thanks, that's a big help. And yeah, I've included the information I thought relivent. But I'd only know exactly what's relivent if I already knew the answer ... yeah for catch 22s :/
[2014-10-17 04:06:47] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-10-17 04:06:53] smellyhippy: "#XGrid tbody tr:nth-child(" + (rowIndex + 1).ToString() + ") td:nth-child(" + (columnIndex + 1).ToString() + ")" is the kind of thing I'm using
[2014-10-17 04:07:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ToString?
[2014-10-17 04:07:19] smellyhippy: C#
[2014-10-17 04:07:28] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right sorry
[2014-10-17 04:07:28] smellyhippy: turns the int in to a string
[2014-10-17 04:07:35] WhereIsMySpoon: yes i thought that was part of your selector string
[2014-10-17 04:07:40] WhereIsMySpoon: i was very confused
[2014-10-17 04:07:42] smellyhippy: ;)
[2014-10-17 04:07:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i know what toSTring is :p
[2014-10-17 04:08:00] WhereIsMySpoon: just didnt read your line properly
[2014-10-17 04:08:01] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-10-17 04:08:04] WhereIsMySpoon: but anyway np
[2014-10-17 04:08:10] WhereIsMySpoon: good luck and as always feel free to ask

[2014-10-17 09:03:27] jimevans: dimacus: if i had to guess, i strongly suspect that the driver isn't seeing the document you're trying to add the cookie to as an HTML document. there's a better-than-even chance there's a bug in the method that checks that.
[2014-10-17 09:03:43] dimacus: hmmm i see
[2014-10-17 09:03:57] dimacus: wait hold on
[2014-10-17 09:04:02] dimacus: this could make sense
[2014-10-17 09:04:16] dimacus: bc i think the guy is trying to set a cookie before he navigates anywhere
[2014-10-17 09:04:25] dimacus: so you are stuck on a non-page page
[2014-10-17 09:04:43] dimacus: but why does it seem to work fine ie10+?
[2014-10-17 09:05:03] jimevans: yeah, but you'll always be on *some* page with the IE driver. remember "this is the initial page for the webdriver server"
[2014-10-17 09:05:17] jimevans: that's one reason we do that.
[2014-10-17 09:05:28] dimacus: gotcha
[2014-10-17 09:05:30] jimevans: because about:blank is "special"
[2014-10-17 09:05:48] lukeis: yeah, most other drivers set "about:blank" :)
[2014-10-17 09:05:55] dimacus: everything in the world of IE is special
[2014-10-17 09:06:00] jimevans: and the API we use to launch IE doesn't recognize about:blank, because protected mode.
[2014-10-17 09:06:09] lukeis: just like jim, dima ;)

[2014-10-17 09:11:54] dimacus: jimevans: ok found a work around

[2014-10-17 09:18:35] Dave_B_: worked great for chrome. Totally broke firefox and the site went… interesting in IE
[2014-10-17 09:18:56] jimevans: running as a windows service is expressly unsupported in the IE driver.
[2014-10-17 09:18:59] Dave_B_: firefox was very odd though - it actually broke, so you couldn't make it work manually afterwards :D
[2014-10-17 09:19:42] Dave_B_: this was many moons ago
[2014-10-17 09:19:56] Dave_B_: yeah I'm aware jim, unfortunately I wasn't aware when i did it :S

[2014-10-17 09:20:42] Dave_B_: bad idea all round
[2014-10-17 09:20:58] jimevans: yep. because services *generally* run in a different user context than an actual users.

Do you have any suggestions how I can speed up the start time of one test? right now it takes about 10 to 15 seconds to start a single test (which only loads the side). It looks like the browser (phantomjs) takes too long to load. Right now, it’s a big waste of time to wait 10 seconds to see the result of a little change…
