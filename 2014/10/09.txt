[2014-10-09 08:04:35] dimacus: nirvdrum: ok current theory is when a new session is being aquired but a test slot on remote becomes unavailable mid flight, so the session exists but the node is not connected, adding more logging, if i fix that bug i will be so crazy happy

[2014-10-09 08:06:50] nirvdrum: Unless there's a threading bug.
[2014-10-09 08:06:59] dimacus: that's possible
[2014-10-09 08:07:00] nirvdrum: Kristian had pretty thoroughly audited that code.
[2014-10-09 08:07:10] AutomatedTester: I theading <3
[2014-10-09 08:07:20] AutomatedTester: fuck...
[2014-10-09 08:07:22] AutomatedTester: :D
[2014-10-09 08:07:24] dimacus: seems to happen when there are many tests running on few test nodes
[2014-10-09 08:07:42] nirvdrum: dimacus: Oh, you may very well be hitting the ol' orphan problem.
[2014-10-09 08:07:48] nirvdrum: Which is why there's an orphan timeout.
[2014-10-09 08:07:56] dimacus: yeah that's what i'm thinking
[2014-10-09 08:08:01] nirvdrum: But I got a lot of flak for that, so people tried to neuter it.
[2014-10-09 08:08:11] dimacus: ahhh
[2014-10-09 08:08:32] nirvdrum: It should apply 100% in the RC case, but I fought with others with it and various timeouts on the WD side.
[2014-10-09 08:08:33] dimacus: but the orphan timeout seems to be too nurfed, so it does not actually delete the orphaned session
[2014-10-09 08:08:38] dimacus: just tries to over and over again
[2014-10-09 08:08:54] nirvdrum: Basically what happens is your client connects to the hub and waits for a slot.  Somewhere, the client times out, but the request is still sitting in the queue.
[2014-10-09 08:09:11] nirvdrum: When the queue gets to that request, it allocates the browser session.  But there's no connected client, so the session just sits there doing nothing.

[2014-10-09 08:09:25] nirvdrum: Eventually it times out.  But most grids have a high timeout value (> 5 min.)
[2014-10-09 08:09:31] dimacus: ahhh yes that actually makes a lot of sense
[2014-10-09 08:09:39] nirvdrum: If your clients have any sort of retry logic, they'll requeue themselves.
[2014-10-09 08:09:49] nirvdrum: But now they're waiting even longer than they would in a normal test session.
[2014-10-09 08:09:53] dimacus: i did set new session and idle timeouts to 120 so occurances have reduced a lot
[2014-10-09 08:09:54] nirvdrum: So, they'll probably timeout again.
[2014-10-09 08:10:03] dimacus: but still once a week it goes into that
[2014-10-09 08:10:16] nirvdrum: So, that was the idea behind he orphan timeout.
[2014-10-09 08:10:25] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i do have to say that the .NET 4.5 threading stuff is pretty nice.
[2014-10-09 08:10:33] dimacus: nirvdrum: ok thanks, this gives me a good solid lead to explore
[2014-10-09 08:10:37] nirvdrum: Basically, if a session is created but no requests come in before the orpah timeout (usually very low), the session is destroyed.
[2014-10-09 08:10:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: cool
[2014-10-09 08:11:12] nirvdrum: But some of the pushback came from people that wanted to create sessions and then keep them idle so a new request could just use the already created session.
[2014-10-09 08:11:16] nirvdrum: Anyway, look at the orphan code.
[2014-10-09 08:11:23] jimevans: the async/await pattern makes it dead simple to do multithreading stuff, and hides a ton of boilerplate code.
[2014-10-09 08:11:32] nirvdrum: The term I used was "orphan" so it should be easy to grep for.
[2014-10-09 08:11:48] dimacus: nirvdrum: almost feels like there should be a way for the "new sessions"  queue to check back with the test to see "do you still want this session"
[2014-10-09 08:11:51] dimacus: awesome thank you sir

[2014-10-09 08:12:17] nirvdrum: So I have a scheduler that polls my grid to see what's available.  Then based on some policy, forwards the request through to the hub.

[2014-10-09 08:22:50] nirvdrum: And then I found it better to push IE jobs ahead of other browsers because I can only run IE 8 on the set of IE 8 machines, but Firefox jobs anywhere.  While I limit the number of sessions per browser, there's also a limit per node.  So I wouldn't want an IE 8 box to be running 3 FF jobs with the rest of the cluster being idle and IE 8 jobs sitting in the queue.
[2014-10-09 08:23:05] nirvdrum: Similar deal for Chrome.

[2014-10-09 11:01:47] Rainbowhat: dimacus , you mean setup a web serivce on python(windows) and ask my server to talk to it?
[2014-10-09 11:02:25] Rainbowhat: i got no api anyway, not sure how with python. Currently method was suppose to work but isnt
[2014-10-09 11:02:26] dimacus: no, if you have a website you are trying to get data from, why not get it directly instead of using seleniu?

[2014-10-09 11:02:36] wdj, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-09 11:03:31] Rainbowhat: dimacus because the data is dynamic, only loads when a browser loads , lots of ajax after the initial load, normal curl wont grab the info. Ajax isnt loaded with curl

[2014-10-09 13:29:50] AutomatedTester: no where do we properly define what interactable is
[2014-10-09 13:29:54] jarib: The Bug

[2014-10-09 13:31:02] jarib: this looks like a definition: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#interactable-elements
[2014-10-09 13:31:08] jarib: an incomplete one, but still
[2014-10-09 13:31:58] jarib: does isDisplayed specify the behaviour when another element is covering it?
[2014-10-09 13:32:09] AutomatedTester: jarib: actually an interactable element doesnt need to fit the displayed algorithm
[2014-10-09 13:32:15] AutomatedTester: if you use keyboard
[2014-10-09 13:32:21] AutomatedTester: if you use mouse then it must
[2014-10-09 13:32:39] jarib: right
[2014-10-09 13:33:02] *AutomatedTester raises a bug so he doesnt forget to do that'
[2014-10-09 13:33:03] jarib: though it says in the spec it must be displayed, to be interactable
[2014-10-09 13:33:06] wdj, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2014-10-09 13:33:14] jarib: well, it's tricky
[2014-10-09 13:33:35] jarib: you expect `element.click if element.displayed?` to work
[2014-10-09 13:33:59] AutomatedTester: yes
[2014-10-09 13:34:02] jarib: i think that's what it boils down to
[2014-10-09 13:34:39] jarib: but what if a button is covered by a transparent div
[2014-10-09 13:34:48] jarib: is it displayed? interactable?
[2014-10-09 13:35:00] AutomatedTester: not displayed but interactable
[2014-10-09 13:35:15] AutomatedTester: therefore click wont work but keyboard actions would
[2014-10-09 13:35:16] jarib: is it clickable?
[2014-10-09 13:35:36] AutomatedTester: if and only if it allows clicks to pass through
[2014-10-09 13:35:36] jarib: so in this case `element.click if element.displayed?` is no longer a reasonable expectation

[2014-10-09 13:50:42] jarib: AutomatedTester: right, that's the root cause of the issue report - chromedriver being picky about clicking obscured elements

[2014-10-09 13:52:45] ism: Is there any work around?
[2014-10-09 13:52:46] jimevans: yep. there's another element in the way at the point where the driver is being told to click

[2014-10-09 15:24:51] jimevans: okay...
[2014-10-09 15:24:55] *AutomatedTester runs away'
[2014-10-09 15:25:15] phasze: looks like to start off I should add a command to the commandInfoRepository to be able to query for the logs?

[2014-10-09 15:27:29] jimevans: actually, i've not made it extensible like it ought to be.

[2014-10-09 15:29:10] jimevans: i don't think that'd be too awful. but i'm not going to do a binary release for it.
[2014-10-09 15:30:02] phasze: alright, so after you've done that and I've built it.  I assume I could just send that command and parse the return for what I need?
[2014-10-09 15:30:26] phasze: or am I still missing grasping and underlying functionality idea?

[2014-10-09 15:34:02] jimevans: so somewhere in your driver subclass, you'd stick in a line that says CommandInfoRepository.Instance.TryAddAdditionalCommand("getLog", new CommandInfo("POST", "/session/{sessionId}/log"));
[2014-10-09 15:34:14] phasze: exactly
[2014-10-09 15:34:18] jimevans: n.b., "getLog" is just arbitrary.

[2014-10-09 15:35:22] jimevans: then, in your subclass, you'd have your driver call this.Execute("getLog", parameters); where parameters is a Dictionary<string, object> that is the valid json wire protocol parameters for the log command.
[2014-10-09 15:35:48] phasze: that part I'll have to play around with

[2014-10-09 15:39:45] phasze: fantastic
[2014-10-09 15:40:29] phasze: I assume I also have to pass the logging level in the capabilities?

[2014-10-09 15:40:52] jimevans: probably
[2014-10-09 15:40:57] phasze: then call this after the test (or whenever I want) and parse the logs

[2014-10-09 15:48:50] jimevans: be aware though that building through visual studio will *not* give you the same binary that you get when downloading from the release or via *sigh* nuget.
[2014-10-09 15:49:05] phasze: do I need to do something different?
[2014-10-09 15:49:28] jimevans: the only way to get an equivalent binary is to build the entire project.
[2014-10-09 15:49:49] jimevans: this is because we embed the firefox extension and other binaries inside the webdriver assembly as resources
[2014-10-09 15:50:19] jimevans: and to build the entire project, you'll need to make sure you have java, and get the crazy-fun build system to work on your system.

[2014-10-09 23:45:23] simsa: hi, I want to do a simple selenium test: go into iframe and validate the text. I do: browser.findElement(myIframe). This is always not found. It will be found, if the iframe is on the top of the screen. It cannot be found if the iframe is at the bottom of the page (user has to scroll down). At the documentation I can found only the sentence: scrolling is automatically done by selenium. But not in this case. Any idea?
