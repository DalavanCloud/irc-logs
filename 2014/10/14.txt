[2014-10-14 09:11:30] ato: “One could define "complete" as the page's onload event having fired” is the same as saying document.readyState == "complete" yes?

[2014-10-14 09:13:14] jimevans: i don't know how to programmatically tell if the onload has fired without having an event handler hooked up to it (which of course we can't reliably do outside the page)
[2014-10-14 09:13:24] jimevans: or even if it's possible
[2014-10-14 09:13:48] jimevans: that method may, in fact, be how to tell that onload has fired, but i honestly don't know.
[2014-10-14 09:13:59] ato: Well the document.onload callback is executed when document.readyState changes, I'm just making sure I understand what you write.
[2014-10-14 09:14:46] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 787
[2014-10-14 09:15:16] jimevans: i put that sentence in because a typical rejoinder to "you can't generically tell when the page is loaded" is "sure you can. just define it as when onload has fired, and we'll at least have a common definition to work with"
[2014-10-14 09:15:35] jimevans: my point is that definition *doesn't* work for at least some use cases.

[2014-10-14 10:41:39] MalekAlrwily: What is Selenium stand-alone and Selenium-RC?
[2014-10-14 10:42:14] ShadowXOR, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-14 10:42:43] dimacus: No More RC!
[2014-10-14 10:42:56] dimacus: sorry inside joke
[2014-10-14 10:43:06] ShadowXOR: In regards to choosing a language to use with Selenium, we're a C# shop so getting help from our developers will be easy, but it seems C# is not a popular language for Selenium is that true?  A lot of learning will be done on my own so I'd prefer online resources to be available for Selenium with the language I learn.  Any thoughts on that?
[2014-10-14 10:43:39] dimacus: MalekAlrwily: RC is dead don't use it. Stand-Alone allows you to start a java server that your tests can connect to and drive a web browser
[2014-10-14 10:44:37] dimacus: MalekAlrwily: if you are using programing language such as Ruby, the selenium gem contacts the stand alone jar to start a new server and your ruby tests talk to in, in tern the stand alone talks to the browser directly

[2014-10-14 10:45:54] dimacus: can you clarify?
[2014-10-14 10:46:02] MalekAlrwily: ok
[2014-10-14 10:46:09] jimevans: ShadowXOR: i take issue with the statement that C# isn't "a popular language for Selenium"

[2014-10-14 10:46:39] ShadowXOR: If I'm wrong that's fine, was just what it seemed based on me looking around online.  If it is, then I'd prefer to use it.
[2014-10-14 10:46:51] dimacus: MalekAlrwily: with node js?
[2014-10-14 10:47:00] jimevans: while many (most?) of the examples you'll find online are java, but the translation between the java api and the .NET api is nearly one-to-one.
[2014-10-14 10:47:14] MalekAlrwily: dimacus: I don't know what is node.js

[2014-10-14 10:47:58] dimacus: MalekAlrwily: i'm confused by your statment of "start stand-alone server using javascript" where is the JavaScript coming from
[2014-10-14 10:48:20] MalekAlrwily: coming from a browser

[2014-10-14 10:51:18] jleyba: The stand-alone server is a java application
[2014-10-14 10:52:00] jimevans: MalekAlrwily: there are lots of developers using so-called "server-side javascript" (usually using node.js or similar) as a standalone programming language.
[2014-10-14 10:52:02] jleyba: You can run javascript without a browser (e.g. node.js). Our node.js library is capable of starting the stand-alone server in a sub-process
[2014-10-14 10:52:10] MalekAlrwily: dimacus: no, because I have the access for this page

[2014-10-14 10:59:51] MalekAlrwily: because I love java
[2014-10-14 10:59:51] jimevans: forget about running a standalone server. you've not provided any reason for doing so yet.
[2014-10-14 10:59:55] lukeis: selenium-standalone-server is a java application, that does not run *in* the browser
[2014-10-14 11:00:24] MalekAlrwily: lukeis: huh O_o
[2014-10-14 11:00:29] jimevans: if you want to automate the android browser from java, using the webdriver api, you have options for doing so.
[2014-10-14 11:00:47] lukeis: browsers run javascript, not java…. Java != JavaScript
[2014-10-14 11:00:58] jimevans: among them, selendroid, appium, and chromedriver (depending on the API level of the version of android you're targeting)
[2014-10-14 11:01:25] MalekAlrwily: I have no luck with them

[2014-10-14 11:02:18] jimevans: MalekAlrwily: you want to automate the browser on an android device, using the java language bindings to the webdriver api to do so, right?
[2014-10-14 11:02:21] lukeis: for example "I want to go to my website in an android browser and click a button, and fill in a form"

[2014-10-14 11:03:17] lukeis: >.>
[2014-10-14 11:03:19] MalekAlrwily: so it will be natively
[2014-10-14 11:03:25] jimevans: ARGH! you're fixated on the standalone server.
[2014-10-14 11:03:41] lukeis: the "standalone-server" does NOT work with android
[2014-10-14 11:03:53] MalekAlrwily: Lol
[2014-10-14 11:04:00] MalekAlrwily: ok, sorry for that
[2014-10-14 11:04:37] MalekAlrwily: I will give selendroid another try
[2014-10-14 11:04:41] lukeis: can you phrase in plain english what you want to do? (see my previous example ^^)
[2014-10-14 11:05:34] MalekAlrwily: jimevans, lukeis: Thank you for your time
[2014-10-14 11:10:50] MalekAlrwily: Selendroid is an open source automation framework which drives of UI of android native, hybrid and mobile web application.

[2014-10-14 11:19:01] mach6: kind of a random question. Any plans to get rid of the jetty-repacked dependencies (2, one on v5 and another on v7) in Selenium-java? Move to a newer jetty?

[2014-10-14 11:19:39] jleyba: been talk of replacing jetty with netty in 3.0, but no one really has time to work on it
[2014-10-14 11:19:52] ism: Jimevans: I have a test in WebDriver (C#) that passeds 100% of the time in firefox, and ie; but I can't get it to run in Chrome. It just keeps saying that the test was skipped. Do you have an ideas as to what could cause this?
[2014-10-14 11:20:10] jarib: dimacus: is that the one that that looks like a timeout to both the server and client, right after the session was created?
[2014-10-14 11:20:22] jimevans: ism: no idea. i don't know how your test runner is set up.
[2014-10-14 11:21:18] SamuraiJack, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2014-10-14 11:21:37] ism: I mean the only thing that's doing is Asserting that an element is present, it's 1 line of code. I'd expect it to pass or fail, but it always says skipped.
[2014-10-14 11:21:42] mach6: jleyba Thanks. What's the eta for 3.0?
[2014-10-14 11:22:00] dimacus: jarib: it seems to be there seems to be an edge case where a test slot gets a timeout due to inactivity, and possibly the same test slot has trouble releasing all further sessions. i have no good way to replicate it consistently
[2014-10-14 11:22:15] jleyba: mach6: ummmm....when the w3c webdriver spec reaches 1.0
[2014-10-14 11:22:17] jarib: hm
[2014-10-14 11:22:33] mach6: jleyba heh. fair enough!
[2014-10-14 11:22:35] *jimevans thinks it's cute that people actually think there's a plan for this project with things like timelines for releases.'
[2014-10-14 11:22:42] dimacus: jarib: but eventually the whole hub goes down bc all of the test slots are in a weird stage but cannot hang on to the session
[2014-10-14 11:22:43] jleyba: Not Real Soon Now
[2014-10-14 11:22:46] jleyba: (tm)
[2014-10-14 11:23:16] dimacus: jarib: ok gonna recompile from source with more log entries on testslots, maybe it is a bad test slot and any session sent to it is doomed

[2014-10-14 11:25:29] mach6: I guess my point of asking was to see if there was time to take on the netty work. I won't have time but I might be able to convince someone.
[2014-10-14 11:27:28] jleyba: mach6: I actually already have a netty-based server for webdriver. but it's just the /wd/hub endpoint - no grid support
[2014-10-14 11:27:54] jleyba: I don't use grid...don't even know how ti works really. Someone would have to do the grid implementation before we could switch the project over
[2014-10-14 11:29:58] mach6: jleyba heh. sounds like we were tinkering in similar code.. I recently made /wd/hub work with jetty 8.. course all grid nodes are still on the repacked v5

[2014-10-14 12:06:57] ato: Such as CSS.
[2014-10-14 12:07:00] jimevans: don't use xpath. :)
[2014-10-14 12:07:22] *ato doesn't understand this fascination with XPath'
[2014-10-14 12:07:24] acz32: css is a better selector?
[2014-10-14 12:07:30] ato: Yes.  In every way.
[2014-10-14 12:07:40] jimevans: acz32: in almost every respect.
[2014-10-14 12:07:43] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-14 12:07:48] ato: CSS selectors are tuned for performance and is supported natively by every browser.
[2014-10-14 12:07:54] *lukeis was going to say don't scrape sites...'
[2014-10-14 12:07:55] jimevans: ato: remember, there *are* use cases that can't be done using css selectors.
[2014-10-14 12:08:17] ato: XPath implementations vary between browsers, they're poorly tested, and some browsers don't implement it at all.
[2014-10-14 12:08:35] ato: This means Selenium must inject a polyfill which may not match other XPath engines.
[2014-10-14 12:08:55] ato: jimevans: Which I've recorded at http://sny.no/2014/09/xpathfeat from our last conversation.
[2014-10-14 12:09:22] acz32: thanks for the advice. i'll use css
[2014-10-14 12:09:28] jimevans: ato: well done, mate.

[2014-10-14 12:12:52] ato: It should.
[2014-10-14 12:12:58] jimevans: totally agree.
[2014-10-14 12:12:59] ato: I support dropping support for it.
[2014-10-14 12:13:51] jimevans: i support that, with the very important caveat that the use cases covered by it can be solved another way.
[2014-10-14 12:14:47] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 786

[2014-10-14 12:17:08] ato: So if someone could come up with a strawman proposal for how we'd construct those missing XPath selector strategies in CSS (think querySelectorAll), we could use a polyfill written in JS.

[2014-10-14 12:20:45] ato: jimevans: That's what the CSS WG member on the desk behind me said )-:
[2014-10-14 12:20:50] jimevans: the really challenging one is the equivalent of the (nonexistent) :contains
[2014-10-14 12:20:59] jimevans: hahaha
[2014-10-14 12:21:20] ato: :contains used to exist.
[2014-10-14 12:21:35] ato: But it was removed due to performance reasons.
[2014-10-14 12:21:47] jimevans: right. i seem to remember that.
[2014-10-14 12:22:04] AutomatedTester: funny that... scanning a document for text might be slow
[2014-10-14 12:22:10] *AutomatedTester never wudda thunk it'
[2014-10-14 12:22:15] ato: Which prompted a need to distinguish between things that could be supported natively e.g. when parsing expressions in a .css file, and things which you might be allowed to call from JS.
[2014-10-14 12:23:28] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-10-14 12:23:30] jimevans: and also, i can kinda see the point in not providing it. CSS is supposed to be about *style*; :contains is about *content*
[2014-10-14 12:23:50] ato: I imagine <style>p:contains("foo") { color: pink }</style> makes for a pretty poor O(n) performance.
[2014-10-14 12:25:19] ato: Of course it's still possible to get a unique CSS selector for anything.  Even without these missing XPath features.
