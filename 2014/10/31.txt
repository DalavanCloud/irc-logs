[2014-10-31 08:10:04] WhereIsMySpoon: is it actually correct

[2014-10-31 08:10:28] polyvisual: sorry, yeah - it works in the chrome console and rolling FF back to 28 is fine
[2014-10-31 08:10:30] WhereIsMySpoon: though I guess it still working if you go back to ff28 is weird
[2014-10-31 08:10:38] WhereIsMySpoon: hm
[2014-10-31 08:10:50] WhereIsMySpoon: polyvisual: can you try changing the locator to css or something else?
[2014-10-31 08:11:11] WhereIsMySpoon: or that not possible
[2014-10-31 08:11:14] polyvisual: unfortunately not - the markup is https://gist.github.com/matthorrocks/cf42a5e6c6ac0b2da46c
[2014-10-31 08:11:35] polyvisual: *developers won't listen to my pleas for nice markup*

[2014-10-31 08:13:38] WhereIsMySpoon: can you try with //span//span instead?

[2014-10-31 09:36:00] jimevans: because if the page being browsed isn't an HTML page, it'll blow up very very badly
[2014-10-31 09:37:03] barancev: I see, but we can blame users :)
[2014-10-31 09:37:13] barancev: that want to set cookies for non-html pages
[2014-10-31 09:38:22] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: what on earth sort of pages are people trying to test with a web content testing tool?
[2014-10-31 09:38:40] WhereIsMySpoon: er, that was meant to jimevans
[2014-10-31 09:38:51] barancev: that's why we can blame them safely
[2014-10-31 09:38:55] WhereIsMySpoon: surely they cant expect the tool to work properly if they try to use it to test xml
[2014-10-31 09:38:56] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: browse to a plain text page. browse to an xml page. in IE, the browser will render *something*
[2014-10-31 09:38:57] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-10-31 09:39:15] WhereIsMySpoon: sure but you cant expect selenium to be abel to test xml
[2014-10-31 09:39:22] WhereIsMySpoon: that isnt what its for xD
[2014-10-31 09:39:37] jimevans: or browse to a PDF, which if you have a plug in installed to view, will display in situ.
[2014-10-31 09:39:58] WhereIsMySpoon: i doubt people are setting cookies whilst viewing a pdf
[2014-10-31 09:40:04] jimevans: and while it shouldn't be expected to work, the executable will crash, hard, without that check

[2014-10-31 09:40:59] jimevans: i absolutely understand that.
[2014-10-31 09:41:04] jimevans: i'm not denying that
[2014-10-31 09:41:22] jimevans: the check isn't just for show.
[2014-10-31 09:41:51] jimevans: it was introduced in the first place because users were doing exactly those things.
[2014-10-31 09:42:03] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-10-31 09:42:22] WhereIsMySpoon: surely thats just user stupidity
[2014-10-31 09:42:28] barancev: the check blocks operation for "valid" cases in favor of increasing safety
[2014-10-31 09:42:37] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-10-31 09:43:00] jimevans: okay, *you* try telling users that a crash in your application is due to their stupidity, especially since it's an entirely unrecoverable crash.
[2014-10-31 09:43:07] jimevans: i'm done with this conversation for now.
