[2014-10-30 04:36:45] susundberg: Hey all -- i have been doing some googling and trying to find out what would be the suggested way of avoiding browser initialization (webdriver.Firefox()) in each test case.
[2014-10-30 04:36:56] swypych, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-30 04:37:35] susundberg: So far i have seen solutions that have say "settings.py" module that gets imported, that initiates the driver, but is that the recommended way -- or is the recommended way to open new browser for each testacase (-> use larger testcases)
[2014-10-30 04:38:22] susundberg: Any example with larger testsuite would be also super nice to see, any tips ?
[2014-10-30 04:38:45] susundberg: (larger testsuite == real life example how the code structure/design pattern works)
[2014-10-30 04:38:45] WhereIsMySpoon: susundberg: when you deploy to a Grid setup with a hub and node, you wont be able to use specific driver instantiation anyway, you'll use RemoteWebDriver
[2014-10-30 04:38:59] WhereIsMySpoon: then you usually set the DesiredCapabilities to which driver you want
[2014-10-30 04:39:19] WhereIsMySpoon: which in my case is driven by a given gradle variable (-DbrowserToUse)
[2014-10-30 04:39:49] tony3, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-30 04:40:15] WhereIsMySpoon: so something like a switch statement on that which will initialise the correct set of capabilities for the browser you want to use
[2014-10-30 04:40:19] susundberg: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks for your reply! So you are doing RemoteWebDriver - initialization in each testcase setUp (or similar)
[2014-10-30 04:40:34] WhereIsMySpoon: i have it in an abstracted method which I am calling in each setUp
[2014-10-30 04:40:39] WhereIsMySpoon: brb few mins

[2014-10-30 04:41:37] susundberg: Ok, but yeah, you are not 'reusing' the driver from the other testcases, thanks (for the explanation why not!).

[2014-10-30 06:19:10] WhereIsMySpoon: susundberg: no worries, feel free to ask questions at any time :)
[2014-10-30 06:21:27] susundberg: Well if you insist ;) Do you happen to know any opensource www-project that would use selenium webdrive for the testing -- it would be fun to see what kind of patterns others have ended up using
[2014-10-30 06:21:46] Dave_B_: mozilla
[2014-10-30 06:21:49] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-10-30 06:22:31] WhereIsMySpoon: i think chrome uses them, which isnt technically open source, but chromium is
[2014-10-30 06:22:49] WhereIsMySpoon: so you could say by extension chromium is tested via selenium, but not directly
[2014-10-30 06:23:36] Dave_B_: for some code examples from mozilla you could look at e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/mozillians-tests
[2014-10-30 06:23:59] WhereIsMySpoon: I use selenium myself :)
[2014-10-30 06:24:12] susundberg: thanks both, but i think the pattern might be weird (as i am going to test www-service) rather than the browser -- i mean, when testing the browser there will surely not be "PageObjects" kind of approach
[2014-10-30 06:24:29] WhereIsMySpoon: susundberg: eh?
[2014-10-30 06:24:40] WhereIsMySpoon: all selenium tests are via the browser
[2014-10-30 06:25:15] susundberg: Yes, sure. I mean, i have site running django to provide www-service, and i want to test that www-service for bugs rather than to test firefox for bugs
[2014-10-30 06:25:29] Dave_B_: there are page objects don't worry
[2014-10-30 06:25:30] susundberg: and to test browser is probably different approach than to test a service
[2014-10-30 06:25:32] susundberg: K
[2014-10-30 06:25:41] WhereIsMySpoon: susundberg: yes ofc, you wont copy the mozilla tests
[2014-10-30 06:25:43] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2014-10-30 06:25:45] WhereIsMySpoon: u make ur own
[2014-10-30 06:25:54] WhereIsMySpoon: but pageobjects are still a useful pattern to follow
[2014-10-30 06:26:00] Dave_B_: mozilla have lots of pages to test too, so the 'I'm testing a webpage' idea is the same
[2014-10-30 06:26:20] susundberg: The mozillians Github looks just what i was looking for, thansk!
[2014-10-30 06:26:27] WhereIsMySpoon: susundberg: one "Page Object" usually represents a webpage or a widget
[2014-10-30 06:26:36] susundberg: yes yes

[2014-10-30 06:55:00] ghormoon: hi, i'm trying my first selenium test, but can't find any assert which will check for text anywhere on page, is there something like that? (exactly to check if the text is not anywhere on page)
[2014-10-30 06:55:20] dimacus: ghormoon: IDE?
[2014-10-30 06:55:37] ghormoon: yup
[2014-10-30 06:56:09] ghormoon: I can use Assert(Not)Text for exact match in exact element, but I need to check if there's none
[2014-10-30 06:56:33] dimacus: assertText
[2014-10-30 06:57:30] ghormoon: that works if I know which element it's in
[2014-10-30 06:58:04] dimacus: this is a bit of an anti practice… but you could check that the element is "body"
[2014-10-30 06:58:10] dimacus: but don't do that, that's bad
[2014-10-30 06:58:25] ghormoon: now I'm trying to check there's no occurence of text on page, so somethnig like assertNotText, but where to point it?
[2014-10-30 06:58:28] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-30 06:58:59] dimacus: typically the element where you expect the text to be/not be
[2014-10-30 06:59:39] ghormoon: the "last" element is a <td>, I'ts table of data selected from database and I'm checking if filters work (so some data is not present)
[2014-10-30 06:59:39] dimacus: again, open up the inspector tool in your browser and find the element you want
[2014-10-30 06:59:43] dimacus: that's best
[2014-10-30 06:59:56] ghormoon: and the elements have different IDs and such
[2014-10-30 06:59:58] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-30 07:00:08] dimacus: ok what about the whole table?
[2014-10-30 07:00:56] dimacus: check if text is present or not somewhere on the table
[2014-10-30 07:01:09] ghormoon: that might do, but eg. now with body, it still passes the test even though it shouldnt :(
[2014-10-30 07:01:26] dimacus: ghormoon: to be honest if you use a real programing language instead of IDE, you can just loop through each TD individually and check content
[2014-10-30 07:03:22] ghormoon: dimacus: If I knew how the tests whould look like, then yep, I'll learn sometime :)
[2014-10-30 07:04:45] dimacus: Pro Tip: in the IDE go to File -> Export test as -> Ruby Test::Unit
[2014-10-30 07:04:50] dimacus: be a happy happy person ;)
[2014-10-30 07:05:26] ghormoon: I eport it to java (junit4) and then convert to testng so it runs with other tests
[2014-10-30 07:05:41] dimacus: touche
[2014-10-30 07:05:46] dimacus: well have fun with that
[2014-10-30 07:06:09] ghormoon: that will have to do, I can't hoose about that

[2014-10-30 10:24:53] simonstewart: barancev: just looking at some of your recent commits
[2014-10-30 10:25:03] barancev: and?
[2014-10-30 10:25:04] simonstewart: Please leave things in the com.thoughtworks.selenium package in the same place
[2014-10-30 10:25:21] simonstewart: People aren't rewriting their RC tests, so moving those classes around is incredibly destructive
[2014-10-30 10:26:05] barancev: yes, I've marked more classes deprecated, nothing was deleted from com.thoughtworks.selenium (iirc)
[2014-10-30 10:26:05] simonstewart: Other than that, I'm on board :)
[2014-10-30 10:26:30] simonstewart: THe deprecation message on Wait suggests it's going to move to "com.thoughtworks.selenium.webdriven"
[2014-10-30 10:26:42] barancev: moving Wait to webdriven breaks a dependency
[2014-10-30 10:26:59] barancev: but, yes, you're right, I'll delete this comment
[2014-10-30 10:27:03] simonstewart: Yes. And it's in the "com.thoughtworks" space and shouldn't be moved :)

[2014-10-30 10:29:22] barancev: simonstewart: btw, what's the planned set of artifacts: 1) RC, 2) WebDriver, 3) WDBS that depends on both
[2014-10-30 10:29:23] dude-x: on my phone
[2014-10-30 10:29:28] dude-x: she doesn't use Siri
[2014-10-30 10:29:29] WhereIsMySpoon: Dude-X_: why? O.o
[2014-10-30 10:29:47] barancev: or 1) WebDriver, 2) RC+WDBS that depends on WebDriver
[2014-10-30 10:30:06] simonstewart: 1) selenium 3 (webdriver APIs), 2) RC interfaces and WDBS, 3) old package and server
[2014-10-30 10:30:08] dude-x: she said she's never felt jealousy before for some reason hearing siri respond to my requests to set a timer really tickles her jealousy bone
[2014-10-30 10:30:24] dude-x: and she doesn't understand it
[2014-10-30 10:30:25] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o

Sometimes when I call '/wd/hub/session/{id}/elements, with a particular xpath, it returns no results, but most of the time it works, against the same content. (the xpath is super simple: //html/descendant-or-self::h1).  Are there any known race conditions or errors wrt selenium server 2.42.2 + Firefox 31.1.0 running headless (xvfb) on a centos 6 OS?
