[2014-10-27 05:09:19] barancev: there is no stability in the world
[2014-10-27 05:09:23] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2014-10-27 05:10:01] barancev: small tests failure is my sin, yes

[2014-10-27 05:11:55] orik, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-27 05:12:40] orik: I'm having a hard time selecting the following with css selectors:
[2014-10-27 05:12:42] orik: <span class="ui-button-text">Save</span>
[2014-10-27 05:13:09] Dave_B_: span.ui-button-text ?
[2014-10-27 05:13:12] orik: I'm working in an application with many other span's and the only thing unique about this one is the save text
[2014-10-27 05:13:24] Dave_B_: does it have a unique parent?
[2014-10-27 05:13:38] orik: Nope
[2014-10-27 05:14:04] barancev: impossible :) how a handler attached to the element?
[2014-10-27 05:14:22] Dave_B_: any ancestor at all that differentiates it from other of similar element? Gotta be a difference somewhere :p
[2014-10-27 05:14:45] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 799
[2014-10-27 05:14:53] orik: It's right next to another button named Cancel and the only thing different is the text
[2014-10-27 05:14:54] orik: php ugh
[2014-10-27 05:15:10] orik: and they share the same parent
[2014-10-27 05:15:33] barancev: first of all, negotiate with the devlopers to add unique ids
[2014-10-27 05:15:41] barancev: it is The Best Solution
[2014-10-27 05:15:46] Dave_B_: well, you could get both then iterate over and look at text, or you could use the order
[2014-10-27 05:15:57] Dave_B_: or better is what barancev said^^ :)
[2014-10-27 05:16:15] orik: my first instinct was to hit the developer over the head, but he's three time zones away and very stubborn. hahaha
[2014-10-27 05:17:17] barancev: if you call her stubborn may be this code is just a revenge :)
[2014-10-27 05:17:58] orik: Well he just hired me to come in and fix his mess but I can't even convince the company to use version control
[2014-10-27 05:18:46] orik: is there any way I can use a :conatins('') sort of thing and specify the text?
[2014-10-27 05:18:47] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: what -are- they using then?
[2014-10-27 05:18:52] WhereIsMySpoon: if not a VCS
[2014-10-27 05:18:54] barancev: imho, you're tryingf to cover the mess now instead of fixing it :)
[2014-10-27 05:19:05] WhereIsMySpoon: zipping up previous versions and archiving them?
[2014-10-27 05:19:17] WhereIsMySpoon: or not even keeping previous versions
[2014-10-27 05:19:43] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: you can use xpath to specify text inside
[2014-10-27 05:19:44] barancev: who cares previos versions?
[2014-10-27 05:19:47] orik: It was just one developer so I think he just keeps a copy on his desktop and sends one up to the 'ftp'
[2014-10-27 05:20:10] WhereIsMySpoon: /span[@class="ui-button-text" and contains(text(), 'Save')]

[2014-10-27 05:23:01] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: does that work?
[2014-10-27 05:23:17] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: you're right! all this work spent on version control is a waste!
[2014-10-27 05:23:25] orik: I'm trying it but I got Unable to locate element: "//span[@class='ui-button-text' and contains(text(), 'Save')]" using: css selector

[2014-10-27 05:23:31] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: its xpath
[2014-10-27 05:23:35] orik: am I supposed to add something in the front to specificy xpath
[2014-10-27 05:23:38] orik: hahaha yeha I know :)

[2014-10-27 05:24:14] jakubojo, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-27 05:24:17] WhereIsMySpoon: or something like that
[2014-10-27 05:24:23] WhereIsMySpoon: if you're in php i got no clue
[2014-10-27 05:24:27] WhereIsMySpoon: stop using php
[2014-10-27 05:24:31] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-10-27 05:24:35] orik: Oh no I'm using Node
[2014-10-27 05:24:38] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-10-27 05:24:52] orik: hahaha but thank you I will see what the binding is for my framework :)
[2014-10-27 05:25:20] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: also uninstall git, to escape from temptation to store history
[2014-10-27 05:25:59] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: sounds good
[2014-10-27 05:26:40] barancev: working without git adds adrenaline to the life
[2014-10-27 05:27:00] orik: I only use git when I work with binary files :)
[2014-10-27 05:27:04] orik: ;)*
[2014-10-27 05:27:33] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: good man
[2014-10-27 05:28:14] orik: wow WhereIsMySpoon I think it worked! Let me add a pause(5000) and watch this time hahaha
[2014-10-27 05:28:32] orik: holy shit you're awesome thanks
[2014-10-27 05:28:42] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: np. Try to use css selectors whenever you can
[2014-10-27 05:28:46] WhereIsMySpoon: xpath as last resort
[2014-10-27 05:28:57] WhereIsMySpoon: xpath isnt a defined standard in IE
[2014-10-27 05:29:10] WhereIsMySpoon: and is also slower iirc
[2014-10-27 05:29:21] WhereIsMySpoon: also bash your dev over the head and get him to add some ids
[2014-10-27 05:29:33] WhereIsMySpoon: or ask for src access and add them yourself
[2014-10-27 05:30:03] *WhereIsMySpoon has direct src access to the code he writes tests for as he is primarily a dev anyway'
[2014-10-27 05:30:10] WhereIsMySpoon: makes life so much easier :P
[2014-10-27 05:30:29] orik: Hopefully after I turn this in today they are going to get a private repo and get me access to source
[2014-10-27 05:30:53] WhereIsMySpoon: crazy
[2014-10-27 05:31:02] WhereIsMySpoon: good luck
[2014-10-27 05:31:31] WhereIsMySpoon: orik: feel free to hang around here and ask questions at any time :) it may take some time to get an answer but we'll get around to it eventually
[2014-10-27 05:31:38] barancev: pause!!! text based locators!!! no git!!! holy shit!
[2014-10-27 05:31:48] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: it's like bingo
[2014-10-27 05:31:55] barancev: high adrenaline extreme game

[2014-10-27 06:34:44] sgsabbage: today I connected up our selenium tests to IE10. *sobs*
[2014-10-27 06:34:58] jimevans: sgsabbage: as opposed to… ?
[2014-10-27 06:35:04] sgsabbage: firefox/chrome
[2014-10-27 06:35:18] jimevans: okay, and?
[2014-10-27 06:35:26] sgsabbage: the test output was like reading a modem dialing up

[2014-10-27 06:35:57] dimacus: you people are no fun
[2014-10-27 06:36:08] sgsabbage: jimevans: It would be less of a problem if the product had been designed with IE10 in mind
[2014-10-27 06:36:10] jimevans: for some definition of "fun".
[2014-10-27 06:36:37] jimevans: out of curiosity, why IE10, and not IE11?
[2014-10-27 06:37:20] sgsabbage: the decision was made to support latest version and latest version - 1
[2014-10-27 06:37:44] *dimacus still has to test on IE8, so be greatful'
[2014-10-27 06:38:28] jimevans: i'd've started with latest, and only gone to latest - 1 then, especially since all other flavors of IE except "latest" are going to be unsupported in the intermediate future anyway.
[2014-10-27 06:38:59] jimevans: let's just say i'm really looking forward to january 2016.
[2014-10-27 06:39:03] sgsabbage: indeed
[2014-10-27 06:39:08] dimacus: +1,000

[2014-10-27 06:40:48] dimacus: yeah same
[2014-10-27 06:41:09] dimacus: however IE8 takes about 60% of my time to maintain...

[2014-10-27 07:14:54] dimacus: so my devious plan of learning C++ and jumping ship to work with you will come to a failure?
[2014-10-27 07:14:55] jimevans: first.
[2014-10-27 07:15:53] jimevans: learning c++ can only be a good thing, if only to help realize just how easy developing in garbage collected languages can be.
[2014-10-27 07:16:30] dimacus: isn't it all just about having good practice, such as, whatever tag you open you need to close?
[2014-10-27 07:17:08] WhereIsMySpoon: c++ memory management is largely automatic with unique_ptr
[2014-10-27 07:17:11] jimevans: should be, but there's something to be said for languages with an automatic garbage collector, in that eventually memory gets reclaimed.
[2014-10-27 07:21:04] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i strongly disagree with that assessment, if only because unique_ptr isn't used in a large portion of COM programming.
[2014-10-27 07:22:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: that doesnt invalidate my statement
[2014-10-27 07:22:35] jimevans: i misspoke.
[2014-10-27 07:22:46] WhereIsMySpoon: if you're developing a new project in c++, memory management is largely automatic when using unique_ptr
[2014-10-27 07:23:05] jimevans: allow me to rephrase. unique_ptr is often entirely inappropriate for interop with other libraries.
[2014-10-27 07:23:17] WhereIsMySpoon: yea well
[2014-10-27 07:23:26] WhereIsMySpoon: thats just the unfortunosity of dealing with older code

[2014-10-27 10:39:27] jimevans: again, i strongly suspect that it's a global IE problem, not "css vs another location strategy"
[2014-10-27 10:39:52] jimevans: by "global" i mean, "not configured properly in your environment"
[2014-10-27 10:39:58] orik: oh mhmmm
[2014-10-27 10:40:29] jimevans: protected mode would be my first guess, but you said you've handled that.
[2014-10-27 10:40:52] orik: and then I added something to the registry... let me make sure I'm running 64 bit ie and that the driver is throwing up the 32 bit
[2014-10-27 10:41:11] jimevans: 64-bit IE. hahahaha
[2014-10-27 10:41:33] jimevans: you're never running *just* 64-bit IE11.

[2014-10-27 10:43:07] orik: oh should I use the 32 bit driver you think?

[2014-10-27 13:21:35] tourdedave: I'm running into issues with Safari Driver in Ruby with the latest 2.44.0 Se release -- both local and remote. Looks like this is a long standing issue (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=7091). Any thoughts?
[2014-10-27 13:22:59] lukeis: downgrade your version of safari or manually install the extension are the only two workarounds i know of :)
[2014-10-27 13:25:22] tourdedave: Hmm. Interesting. Is this only a Ruby issue?
[2014-10-27 13:25:33] jimevans: tourdedave: nope.
[2014-10-27 13:26:05] lukeis: that's broke for everybody on the latest version of safari
[2014-10-27 13:26:13] jimevans: apple changed some stuff with safari in the latest versions, and the driver hasn't kept up, because it's unmaintained.
[2014-10-27 13:26:35] lukeis: Safari driver could use a new maintainer… interested tourdedave? ;)
[2014-10-27 13:26:58] lukeis: we will hand out a commit bit to he who steps up and fixes it ;)
[2014-10-27 13:27:05] tourdedave: Hah :-)

[2014-10-27 13:28:07] jimevans: he has no interest in maintaining it
[2014-10-27 13:28:28] nirvdrum: In case you guys don't obsessively check my Twitter account, I announced earlier today that I'm shutting down Mogotest at the end of November.
[2014-10-27 13:28:55] lukeis: his stance is that there isn't a use case where testing in a javascript unit test can't catch something in the full blown browser
[2014-10-27 13:29:07] lukeis: nirvdrum: ohhhh
[2014-10-27 13:29:11] lukeis: i did miss that

[2014-10-27 13:29:40] jimevans: lukeis, my response for that is you can make the same case for any browser-based tests then.
[2014-10-27 13:29:44] nirvdrum: I'd say scotch, but it took a lot to get me to shut it down :-P
[2014-10-27 13:30:01] lukeis: yeah, i bet :)
[2014-10-27 13:30:05] nirvdrum: I have a few things percolating.
[2014-10-27 13:30:08] lukeis: want to work for salesforce? :)

[2014-10-27 13:30:51] nirvdrum: Heh.  I appreciate the gesture.  After immersing myself fully in this stuff for 5 years, I think I need to do something a bit different to maintain my sanity.
[2014-10-27 13:31:12] nirvdrum: And honestly it'd help me feel like less of a failure if I didn't end up doing a lot of the same work somewhere else :-/
[2014-10-27 13:31:14] lukeis: no worries :) we're here if you want

[2014-10-27 15:23:29] Selenium-Git: 13selenium/06master 144103276 15Alexei Barantsev: Fixing stack frame parser for Firefox new stack trace format (with column numbers and more allowed symbols in function names). Fixes issue 8093
[2014-10-27 15:24:16] jleyba: barancev: consider using webdriver.stacktrace for parsing?
[2014-10-27 15:24:44] barancev: yes, may be it is worth to fix webdriver.stacktrace
[2014-10-27 15:24:51] barancev: and use it
[2014-10-27 15:25:10] barancev: on the next iteration :)
[2014-10-27 15:25:25] Neo--, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-27 15:25:30] jleyba: fix it? Is it broken?
[2014-10-27 15:25:42] barancev: yes
[2014-10-27 15:26:01] barancev: because firefox now reports both line and column number
[2014-10-27 15:26:22] barancev: and webdriver.stacktrace gets the last part as the line number, that's wrong
[2014-10-27 15:26:43] whitby, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-27 15:26:58] barancev: and I don't know why firefox driver uses its own implementation. it is not me :)
[2014-10-27 15:27:14] jleyba: firefoxdriver implementation is much older
[2014-10-27 15:28:50] barancev: ok, I'll try to migrate to the atom
[2014-10-27 15:29:48] jleyba: oh. webdriver.stacktrace doesn't extract line and column numbers. it only just extracts the location as a single string
[2014-10-27 15:30:01] jleyba: (intentionally so)
[2014-10-27 15:30:20] barancev: so it is much simpler than the fixefox driver implementation
[2014-10-27 15:30:52] barancev: fixefox, a nice typo :)

[2014-10-27 21:07:53] Cow_woC: Hi
[2014-10-27 21:09:04] Cow_woC: I am trying to open a new tab using "new Actions(driver).contextClick(element).sendKeys("t").perform()". The context menu opens up but the key is ignored. I tried sending other keys (like ARROW_DOWN) and sleeping between the time the context menu opens up and when I send the keys. The keys never work. Any ideas?
[2014-10-27 21:11:29] Cow_woC: (I am using the latest ChromeDriver)
[2014-10-27 21:12:58] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: what language are you using?
[2014-10-27 21:13:12] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: Java
[2014-10-27 21:13:32] Cow_woC: What's odd is all the forums seem to show the same code working just fine... but it's not working for me. The context menu pops up but then nothing happens.
[2014-10-27 21:14:07] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: ok, well in python I use 'send_keys(Keys.RETURN)' to send 'enter'
[2014-10-27 21:14:46] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 801
[2014-10-27 21:14:47] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: Yeah, similar concept for Java. But can you try contextClick(element).sendKeys("t").perform() like I mentioned above?
[2014-10-27 21:15:02] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: I think there is something special going on with the context menu.
[2014-10-27 21:15:04] *cjbayliss goes looking'
[2014-10-27 21:15:33] Cow_woC: And again, this is Chrome (on Windows)... so try testing on that if you can.
[2014-10-27 21:18:03] cjbayliss: I can't. I use linux
[2014-10-27 21:18:33] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: So try Linux :)
[2014-10-27 21:18:40] Cow_woC: It shouldn't make much of a difference.
[2014-10-27 21:18:45] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: But is it Chrome?
[2014-10-27 21:18:51] cjbayliss: no
[2014-10-27 21:18:59] Cow_woC: Which browser?
[2014-10-27 21:19:15] cjbayliss: Firefox, so a lot different
[2014-10-27 21:19:20] Cow_woC: Yup :)
[2014-10-27 21:19:51] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: try contextClick(element).sendKeys("t")
[2014-10-27 21:20:23] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: Isn't that identical to what I wrote I am already doing (above)?
[2014-10-27 21:20:53] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: no. you are doing contextClick(element).sendKeys("t").perform()
[2014-10-27 21:21:12] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: You want me to omit perform()?
[2014-10-27 21:21:25] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: because otherwise the two are identical...
[2014-10-27 21:21:35] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: yes
[2014-10-27 21:21:41] Cow_woC: cjbayliss: But without perform() nothing runs.
[2014-10-27 21:21:52] Cow_woC: the actions get queued but never run...
[2014-10-27 21:22:19] cjbayliss: Cow_woC: ah, that will be the differance between Java and python.
[2014-10-27 21:22:30] cjbayliss: I know no Java.

[2014-10-27 23:02:18] kandinski: could anybody lend me a hand here: http://paste.lisp.org/display/144183 ?
[2014-10-27 23:03:38] Cow_woC: kandinski: Java is complaining some JAR file was used during compilation but is missing from the classpath at runtime.
[2014-10-27 23:04:06] Cow_woC: kandinski: I'm new to Selenium so I don't know which JAR file this is exactly.
[2014-10-27 23:05:07] kandinski: Cow_woC: thanks a lot (and awesome nickname!)
[2014-10-27 23:05:17] Cow_woC: kandinski: You're welcome, and thanks :)
