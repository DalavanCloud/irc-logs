[2014-10-01 01:04:26] losh: Hi, I'm trying to setup selenium grid with nodes which have multiple instances of xvfb.  I'm not clear on how the selenium node decides which display should be used for a given script.  Does anyone here have such a setup which could walk me through how to get such a configuration working correctly?

[2014-10-01 01:12:58] WhereIsMySpoon: losh: you only need to use xbfb-run for starting the node - once it's started it's persistent for as long as you want the node up

[2014-10-01 01:15:25] losh: WhereIsMySpoon:  I want execution isolation between browser instances (this machine will be shared between different teams).  I was thinking to setup mutliple X servers as a given system user, then have one node instance dispatch scripts to the appropriate X instance.  I was thinking each team would specify a display in their selenium scripts to pick the X/nagivator combination (if that all makes sense?)

[2014-10-01 01:16:11] losh: I'm new to selenium so I don't even know if what I'm trying to do is supported.
[2014-10-01 01:16:28] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont think that's possible
[2014-10-01 01:16:43] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium really only interacts with the browser
[2014-10-01 01:17:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you could maybe do it with other code/libraries
[2014-10-01 01:17:06] WhereIsMySpoon: but not with just selenium
[2014-10-01 01:18:04] losh: OK .. so I'll have to think outside the box a little ... or abandon the idea.  Thanks for your help ... I'm going to have a tinker with the info in the url you sent earlier.

[2014-10-01 01:19:19] WhereIsMySpoon: losh: I don't see the problem with, for example, you setting up say 10 nodes on the machine, all with xvfb-run on different displays, and then people just running scripts from the hub
[2014-10-01 01:19:31] WhereIsMySpoon: does that not satisfy your requirements?
[2014-10-01 01:20:33] WhereIsMySpoon: although you'd have to make sure to have an interceptor on each script fire so that all the tests are parallel
[2014-10-01 01:20:37] losh: It may do.  I was hoping to get process seperation with different system accounts.  Which I may be able to acheive through sudo.
[2014-10-01 01:20:45] WhereIsMySpoon: brb
[2014-10-01 01:20:49] losh: OK.
[2014-10-01 01:25:41] losh: WhereIsMySpoon: you make a good point.  I was trying to reduce resource consommation.  10 JVM instances verses 1 to manage all the browsers sounded heavy.
[2014-10-01 01:29:14] WhereIsMySpoon: losh: I dont think the jvm itself really uses a lot of memory, especially if you limit it with Xmx and Xms
[2014-10-01 01:29:40] WhereIsMySpoon: losh: please bear in mind that just because you have 10 nodes all connected to a hub does not mean that you magically have parallel tests
[2014-10-01 01:29:48] WhereIsMySpoon: you have to actually fire them off in a parallel way
[2014-10-01 01:30:57] WhereIsMySpoon: usually you'd have some sort of test runner that does for(Test t : tests) { fireNewProcess(t.test()); }
[2014-10-01 01:31:03] losh: oh, i was of the impression that you dispatch a script and the grib allocated it to which ever node had the corresponding platform/browser resource available.
[2014-10-01 01:31:45] jimb: I'm glad I'm not the only one that was under that impression.
[2014-10-01 01:31:53] WhereIsMySpoon: it will, but if you then execute a second test, it will be executed on the same process line as the first unless you fire a new process for it

[2014-10-01 01:33:00] losh: WhereIsMySpoon: I see. And the fire new process is managed from with the selenium script or externally?

[2014-10-01 01:33:20] losh: I don't know what that is .. I'll have RTFM more.
[2014-10-01 01:33:30] jimb: something along the lines of: "Grid does NOT give you parallelization, Grid DOES give you the CAPABILITY of running tests in parallel"

[2014-10-01 01:35:36] WhereIsMySpoon: halfway down the page
[2014-10-01 01:36:13] WhereIsMySpoon: the point is that on the hub's side, it will try and execute the tests one after the other
[2014-10-01 01:36:28] losh: WhereIsMySpoon:  You've re-aligned my understand of selenium grid and clearly I need to rethink what I'm try to achieve here.  Thanks a lot, I'm going to pop off and study up a bit.  Thanks for the link, we're a Python shop where I work so that link's prefect.
[2014-10-01 01:36:30] WhereIsMySpoon: if you put each test run in a separate process, it will all execute in parallel
[2014-10-01 01:36:42] WhereIsMySpoon: and the grid will allocate each test to a differetn node
[2014-10-01 01:37:17] WhereIsMySpoon: no probs, feel free to ask more qs at any time :)

[2014-10-01 01:40:51] jimb: What happens if there are moar processes than nodes and browsers. Will the hub queue them up or do I need to handle that in code?
[2014-10-01 01:41:50] jimb: I differe here between "a node with that cabability does not EXIST" and "a node with that capability exists, but it is BUSY"
[2014-10-01 01:43:01] WhereIsMySpoon: i would imagine it would be queued up, it's the same state as if you just fired up all the tests without process handling
[2014-10-01 01:43:17] WhereIsMySpoon: well actually...not quite the same state
[2014-10-01 01:43:30] WhereIsMySpoon: cause the tests that cant run are in different processes
[2014-10-01 01:43:35] WhereIsMySpoon: not sure then
[2014-10-01 01:43:38] WhereIsMySpoon: tias :)
[2014-10-01 01:44:44] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 831
[2014-10-01 01:46:36] jimb: Right, that's what I was expecting (queued up)
[2014-10-01 01:47:34] jimb: And since the code, I'm speculating regardless of level of parallelization, hands over the code to the hub and waits for a response (or not) I'm ASSuming the hub will queue it.

[2014-10-01 01:48:26] jimb: nope, I'll hold you personally responsible ;)
[2014-10-01 01:48:26] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium works on a simple approach, and to do as little jobs as possible (it's job really is just to communicate between the browser and your script, and expose the apis to do that)
[2014-10-01 01:48:46] jimb: yes, and that's the way we like it
[2014-10-01 01:48:47] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore it isnt unreasonable to assume that they didnt implement any queueing mechanism
[2014-10-01 01:48:49] jimb: kiss basically

[2014-10-01 01:48:58] WhereIsMySpoon: hey dave :)
[2014-10-01 01:49:12] WhereIsMySpoon: but anyway, it isnt hard to find out :D
[2014-10-01 01:49:38] WhereIsMySpoon: fire up a node + hub locally, fire up more processes with tests than you have browsers, done
[2014-10-01 01:50:12] WhereIsMySpoon: I think by default nodes have 4 ff, 4 chrome, 2 IE and 2 opera browser instances available
[2014-10-01 01:50:22] WhereIsMySpoon: not 100%
[2014-10-01 01:50:28] WhereIsMySpoon: its documented somewhere
[2014-10-01 01:52:18] antsanto: People out there, does any one used Selenide wrapper for Selenium?
[2014-10-01 01:53:00] WhereIsMySpoon: "It's extremely easy to start using Selenide. Definitely not a rocket science."
[2014-10-01 01:53:07] WhereIsMySpoon: "-a- rocket science"?
[2014-10-01 01:53:25] WhereIsMySpoon: "The whole work with Selenide consists of three simple things! "
[2014-10-01 01:53:34] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: this website is terrible for selenide

[2014-10-01 01:57:31] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: I'd recommend against using something like this tbh, selenium is already quite concise, and adding another layer on top of it just makes it more likely to break

[2014-10-01 02:07:03] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: then when this is passed to the driver, it would look up the element with css of '#searchInput' and send "searchTerm" to it

[2014-10-01 02:07:53] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: but yea all I have at the moment are just methods with lots of parameters for all the data that is needed to pass to the forms im filling

[2014-10-01 10:59:25] dimacus: smccarthy: well need some logs to debug, you got those?
[2014-10-01 10:59:55] smccarthy: Ok yea, I can check the logs.
[2014-10-01 11:00:45] smccarthy: dimacus:  so with the jenkins grid plugin, Are those statistics with the hub ? or ?
[2014-10-01 11:00:52] smccarthy: or per node ?
[2014-10-01 11:01:05] dimacus: both, currently working on node
[2014-10-01 11:01:18] dimacus: and then will add a grid view for the whole hub
[2014-10-01 11:04:26] smccarthy: I can't think of anything more to add just yet, I'll keep thinking though
[2014-10-01 11:04:46] dimacus: cool
[2014-10-01 11:05:29] smccarthy: and grid_extras didn't show anything about an error
[2014-10-01 11:05:39] dimacus: what about hub log?
[2014-10-01 11:05:46] smccarthy: not in there either.
[2014-10-01 11:05:49] smccarthy: Does yours ever just quit ?
[2014-10-01 11:06:03] smccarthy: the hub/nodes are still up, just the hub's extras jar isnt
[2014-10-01 11:06:32] dimacus: no never had that happen
[2014-10-01 11:06:37] dimacus: wonder if you have something else killing it
[2014-10-01 11:07:55] smccarthy: maybe. I did notice that the SetupTeardown proxy was giving me issues, so i removed it from my node's json

[2014-10-01 11:32:57] smccarthy: well the screenshot might not be full screen. But if it was full screen, than yes

[2014-10-01 12:43:47] dvorkbjel, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-01 12:43:50] jimevans: it's now the text of the child <button> element.
[2014-10-01 12:43:52] jeffg: jimevans, right, i understand why it broke.
[2014-10-01 12:44:00] lukeis: i think you can use "." instead?
[2014-10-01 12:44:14] jimevans: doesn't matter, i don't think.
[2014-10-01 12:44:17] jeffg: just trying to get a handle on whether i can be lazy here
[2014-10-01 12:44:18] lukeis: …. and contains(., 'Edit')
[2014-10-01 12:44:29] jimevans: that might work, but i'm not sure it will.
[2014-10-01 12:44:36] lukeis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2014-10-01 12:44:40] *lukeis hates xpath'
[2014-10-01 12:44:41] jimevans: because again, the <a> element has no text child.
[2014-10-01 12:44:45] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 821
[2014-10-01 12:45:21] lukeis: could do //a[contains(@href, 'SeleniumTestGroup') and contains(@href, 'editRequisition')]/button[.='Edit']
[2014-10-01 12:45:25] jeffg: sounds as if the right answer is "stop using RC", but i have no idea what to use in its place as i'm cargo-culting here
[2014-10-01 12:45:36] lukeis: WebDriver :)
[2014-10-01 12:46:02] jeffg: good to know
[2014-10-01 12:46:19] jimevans: lukeis: your xpath is correct. though if you want the actual <a> element, you'd need to navigate up to the parent node in the xpath.
[2014-10-01 12:46:21] barancev: actually, migration to webdriver does not resolve xpath-related issues :)
[2014-10-01 12:46:25] jeffg: would a good halfway solution be to slap an id on that <a> and select it by that in the RC?
[2014-10-01 12:46:33] lukeis: yes
[2014-10-01 12:46:36] lukeis: that would be ideal
[2014-10-01 12:46:42] jeffg: xpath i don't mind so much. xml is my everyday reality.
[2014-10-01 12:46:54] jimevans: jeffg: you have my sympathies.

[2014-10-01 12:47:19] jeffg: jimevans, thanks, but not necessary. i'm a fan. sick that way, i suppose.
[2014-10-01 12:47:45] jimevans: xml is a perfectly fine data interchange format, as long as no human ever has to read or write it.

[2014-10-01 12:58:39] jeffg: jimevans, lukeis, thanks for the tips. i moved to using an id and pushed... guess i'll know tomorrow whether i got it right :)
[2014-10-01 12:59:15] lukeis: you can't run one of the tests one-off yourself?

[2014-10-01 13:04:13] AutomatedTester: jleyba: could this be because the atoms were compiled with an older closure
[2014-10-01 13:04:17] AutomatedTester: or ...
[2014-10-01 13:05:03] jleyba: is it being used in strict mode?
[2014-10-01 13:05:15] AutomatedTester: um probably
[2014-10-01 13:05:33] jleyba: the compiler generates es3 compatible code by default. might contribute to some of those warnings

[2014-10-01 13:07:03] AutomatedTester: if so could we ES4 the atoms?
[2014-10-01 13:07:35] jimevans: IE7, yes. we officially dropped support for IE6, though i've maintained that it should still "work"
[2014-10-01 13:07:42] jimevans: this might change that.
[2014-10-01 13:07:48] AutomatedTester: booo hissss
[2014-10-01 13:07:51] AutomatedTester: :)
[2014-10-01 13:07:54] jimevans: which i'm okay with, by the way.
[2014-10-01 13:08:28] jleyba: output options are ES3, ES5, or ES5 strict
