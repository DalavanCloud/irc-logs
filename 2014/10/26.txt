[2014-10-26 10:41:33] Rajat: Hi Selenium Developers
[2014-10-26 10:42:41] Rajat: is there a way we can restart remote server while into a test? is that server stateless or has state w.r.t current session
[2014-10-26 10:44:45] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 795
[2014-10-26 10:46:54] HolyGoat: Rajat: not an expert, but since there are calls being made to the server specifically to create and delete a session during a run, I suspect that there will be session state on the server side
[2014-10-26 10:48:34] HolyGoat: I put a bunch of Selenium nodes behind an F5 load balancer a while ago, and had to get creative with load balancer irules to get session persistence working well for Selenium sessions (both the RC and Webdriver versions)
