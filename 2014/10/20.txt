[2014-10-20 08:00:52] nedbat: totally impossible question: is there any way I could make an assertion that there is no blue on a page?
[2014-10-20 08:00:54] dimacus: morning
[2014-10-20 08:01:10] dimacus: nedbat: like no blue divs?
[2014-10-20 08:01:14] jimevans: so. random question. if you heard that a commercial automation vendor (say, HP or Telerik or similar) was working to base their web automation on webdriver, is that something you'd support? if not, why not?
[2014-10-20 08:01:37] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-10-20 08:01:43] dimacus: nedbat: also, what shade of blue? there are thousands… do you care a specific blue to not be tehre or any blue?
[2014-10-20 08:01:54] admc, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-10-20 08:02:42] ddary: jimevans: first it sounds good, but the important thing from my perspective is if they support the open source project with developer resources.
[2014-10-20 08:02:50] nedbat: dimacus: the idea here is that my site will have a way to apply themes.  The default will be bluish.  I want to create a "red" theme, then assert there is no blue, to check that there's no hard-coded blue on the page.
[2014-10-20 08:03:00] nedbat: dimacus: so this is very ill-defined...
[2014-10-20 08:03:33] nedbat: dimacus: it could be that i have a handful of blue colors, and want to check that none of them appear.
[2014-10-20 08:03:34] dimacus: nedbat: i mean if you just gonna check a couple divs, you should be able to pull the color attribute from element, if i'm not mistaking
[2014-10-20 08:04:11] dimacus: nedbat: find_element_by_class_name("bar").value_of_css_property('background-color')
[2014-10-20 08:04:28] dimacus: that might work
[2014-10-20 08:04:32] nedbat: dimacus: i could also iterate all the elements to check them I guess
[2014-10-20 08:04:34] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-20 08:04:36] jimevans: ddary: that's fair, i suppose. how would you feel about it if they were simply consumers of the oss project, then? (no different than the thousands upon thousands of websites that rely on jquery)
[2014-10-20 08:05:00] emakiej, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-10-20 08:05:32] jimevans: (and i'll be re-asking these questions in another hour or so when our US west coast contingent comes online)
[2014-10-20 08:05:37] dimacus: nedbat: just remeber, going over all elements will be expensive in long run
[2014-10-20 08:06:15] ddary: jimevans: i think if they rely their business on us, they have to support the project. that is how I think.
[2014-10-20 08:07:23] Albino1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-20 08:07:40] nedbat: dimacus: sure, but automated tests beat almost everything else anyway
[2014-10-20 08:07:59] dimacus: nedbat: so short answer is yes you can check for color using the css value method, long answer is, might be hard depending on how involved you wanna make those tests
[2014-10-20 08:08:14] nedbat: dimacus: right.  thanks.

[2014-10-20 08:16:46] jimevans: but again, i don't think i *require* all of the products i pay for that use open source software as part of their construction to make contributions back to those oss projects.

[2014-10-20 08:39:31] jimevans: dimacus: i've heard rumors that late-model versions of safari have this difficulty. no one is actively working on the safari driver at the moment, but i suspect it's because the extension isn't getting installed.

[2014-10-20 08:40:11] dimacus: so just install by hand after compile from source?

[2014-10-20 11:15:03] jleyba: jimevans: It's a project commitment thing. I officially stepped back from the SD a long time ago. No one else in the community has expressed any interest in working on it
[2014-10-20 11:15:20] jleyba: So if no one is going to step up, then we need to just accept that we've decided as a community it's not worth keeping around
[2014-10-20 11:15:32] dimacus: jleyba: there are a couple, from time to time, a new session opens in a new tab so the test runs in a tab that has no focus causing a browser crash
[2014-10-20 11:15:39] dimacus: that's one of the annoying ones
[2014-10-20 11:15:53] dimacus: i have plenty of videos to show it happen, since i've started to record test runs
[2014-10-20 11:17:12] jimevans: jlebya: i get where you're coming from, and i'm sympathetic. i just don't think "no one is willing to maintain it right now" == "we don't care about it as a community"
