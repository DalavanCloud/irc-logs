[2014-10-25 13:09:17] apollo13: adaro: aside from not beeing able to help you, why do you use etags for javascript files?
[2014-10-25 13:09:27] apollo13: seems like a waste of ressources
[2014-10-25 13:10:03] adaro: in this case the etag is “misused” as a cookie substitute
[2014-10-25 13:10:34] adaro: its basically a clever trick to set a cookie when this would otherwise not be supported
[2014-10-25 13:11:24] apollo13: apparently to clever? *scnr*
[2014-10-25 13:11:42] adaro: too has 2 o’s ;-)
[2014-10-25 13:12:13] apollo13: ah yeah, english and me are not always on the same page
[2014-10-25 13:12:18] adaro: hehe
[2014-10-25 13:12:26] apollo13: and I probably :þ
[2014-10-25 13:12:47] adaro: anyway it’s like selenium is never sending the if-none-match header when requesting a page
[2014-10-25 13:13:01] adaro: while if i do it manually from the same browser instance it does work
[2014-10-25 13:13:22] adaro: so it’s nothing to do with the firefox profile or whatever
[2014-10-25 13:14:04] apollo13: odd
[2014-10-25 13:14:45] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 802
[2014-10-25 13:16:46] apollo13: adaro: but just so I understand you correctly, you use etags to send a session-identifier?
[2014-10-25 13:17:02] apollo13: that seems quite interesting :)
[2014-10-25 13:17:19] apollo13: although I wonder if it breaks with proxies in between
[2014-10-25 13:17:26] adaro: we use a cookie on the website to track users. so we can see who uses multiple accounts
[2014-10-25 13:17:36] adaro: but people delete the cookies
[2014-10-25 13:17:59] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-25 13:18:32] apollo13: hehe, interesting idea
[2014-10-25 13:18:37] *apollo13 deletes history in that case'
[2014-10-25 13:18:53] adaro: you’d have to delete your cache
[2014-10-25 13:18:56] adaro: and your cookies
[2014-10-25 13:18:56] apollo13: if people can delete cookies I'd suppose they can delete the history or use private mode
[2014-10-25 13:19:09] apollo13: yeah that's what I ment with "history"
[2014-10-25 13:19:18] adaro: yeah, chrome’s incognito mode has its own cache
[2014-10-25 13:19:21] apollo13: (cause that's what firefox calls it in the popup)
[2014-10-25 13:19:25] adaro: so thats another option
[2014-10-25 13:19:38] adaro: anyway, someone thought it was a good idea to do this
[2014-10-25 13:20:15] adaro: but it broke, and i’d like to write a test for it :)
[2014-10-25 13:20:49] adaro: but selenium wont let me
