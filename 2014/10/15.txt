[2014-10-15 01:23:56] smellyhippy: Mornin' all. I'm trying to interact with an autocomplete text box. To do this I've used clickAndWait to click in the textbox and wait for the autocompletion box to show. However this gives me a timeout error "[error] Timed out after 30000ms" and causes the run to fail. Upon further investigation I found the the documentation says "Many Actions can be called with the "AndWait" suffix, e.g.
[2014-10-15 01:23:56] smellyhippy: "clickAndWait". This suffix tells Selenium that the action will cause the browser to make a call to the server, and that Selenium should wait for a new page to load.". I am not loading a new page and I assume the fact this fails to happen is what causes the error.
[2014-10-15 01:24:04] smellyhippy: For this test the autocomplete box is operated using the mouse, one click in the box to bring up the list, one click to select an item. Is there an alternative wait/sleep command to use? Or is my approach flawed?

[2014-10-15 01:28:35] smellyhippy: hmmmmmm the documentation also says "If the click action causes a new page to load (like a link usually does), call waitForPageToLoad." ... I assumethat just means that's the prefered way out of the two?
[2014-10-15 01:33:03] barancev: the preferred way is to stop using Selenium RC :)
[2014-10-15 01:33:12] barancev: it is deprecated
[2014-10-15 01:33:21] barancev: please use WebDriver
[2014-10-15 01:33:25] losh, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-15 01:34:04] smellyhippy: I'm running it in the browser to test it works, I have a c# app to drop the generated steps in to
[2014-10-15 01:34:24] smellyhippy: are there differences? will the webdriver in the c# app "just work"?
[2014-10-15 01:34:45] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: you're using the IDE right?
[2014-10-15 01:35:33] barancev: nothing will "just work" if you deal with complex interfaces (autompletion et all)
[2014-10-15 01:35:46] barancev: but WebDriver provides more options to wait for something
[2014-10-15 01:36:05] WhereIsMySpoon: and has better internals in general
[2014-10-15 01:38:50] barancev: oh, god! it seems that FF33 broke something....

[2014-10-15 01:40:41] barancev: <span id="xxx"><a href="...">link</a></span> -- when selenium attemts to click the span it should click the link inside it
[2014-10-15 01:40:51] barancev: but it does not :(
[2014-10-15 01:40:58] barancev: FF32 is ok
[2014-10-15 01:42:16] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: why does it do that
[2014-10-15 01:42:22] WhereIsMySpoon: as in why would it click the internal element
[2014-10-15 01:42:40] WhereIsMySpoon: is that specific for spans?

[2014-10-15 01:52:57] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: with native events selenium clicks "on coordinates"
[2014-10-15 01:53:30] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: I thought native events were only on by default for IE
[2014-10-15 01:53:35] WhereIsMySpoon: firefox and chrome use virtual events
[2014-10-15 01:53:42] WhereIsMySpoon: or no?
[2014-10-15 01:54:01] barancev: firefox on windows uses native events by default (if available)
[2014-10-15 01:54:07] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2014-10-15 01:54:13] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought the virtual ones were better
[2014-10-15 01:54:22] barancev: I agree
[2014-10-15 01:55:11] barancev: and I campain to make synthesized events default on all OSes
[2014-10-15 01:55:14] barancev: but...
[2014-10-15 01:55:24] WhereIsMySpoon: synthesised events thats it
[2014-10-15 01:55:26] WhereIsMySpoon: not virtua
[2014-10-15 01:55:26] WhereIsMySpoon: l
[2014-10-15 01:55:32] barancev: native events have strong lobby

[2014-10-15 02:18:03] smellyhippy: WhereIsMySpoon: Sorry, I got pulled in to a meeting. Yep, it's the IDE 2.8.0 running in FF 32 (though FF just updated to 33 a moment ago).
[2014-10-15 02:19:23] smellyhippy: barancev: my issue is "clickAndWait" causes an error ... I don't think that's due to complex interfaces, but more likely a poor choice of command on my part.
[2014-10-15 02:20:01] barancev: clickAndWait waits for a new page to load
[2014-10-15 02:20:30] barancev: if there is no new page -- don't use AndWait

[2014-10-15 02:26:10] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: dont use the IDE - the tech it uses (RC) is deprecated, and the IDE itself does not lend to stable, complex tests
[2014-10-15 02:26:18] WhereIsMySpoon: code your tests with webdriver
[2014-10-15 02:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: automated testing is a programming job, not a manual QA job and requires proper effort and investment
[2014-10-15 02:27:17] *WhereIsMySpoon feels like the ghost of jimevans'
[2014-10-15 02:28:07] smellyhippy: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm using the IDE to create the rough test script, then improving it manually when put it in the test app/suite.
[2014-10-15 02:28:21] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: im saying to not use it at all
[2014-10-15 02:28:33] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver uses substantially different technology and different approaches
[2014-10-15 02:28:50] smellyhippy: I'm cirtianly not relying on it as the sole method of achiving this and my issue appears to not be with the IDE, but with my understanding. I'm working to fix my understanding.
[2014-10-15 02:28:51] WhereIsMySpoon: you will get flaky, unreliable and unstable tests with the IDE
[2014-10-15 02:29:06] WhereIsMySpoon: this is a more general note
[2014-10-15 02:29:11] WhereIsMySpoon: not related to your particular issue
[2014-10-15 02:29:35] smellyhippy: can you give an example of where using the IDE and then manually improving the output would fail?
[2014-10-15 02:29:46] WhereIsMySpoon: "manually improving the output"?
[2014-10-15 02:30:00] WhereIsMySpoon: you mean the xml it generates?
[2014-10-15 02:30:22] smellyhippy: I have it output C# then improve any bits that need it
[2014-10-15 02:30:30] WhereIsMySpoon: ok dont do that, really
[2014-10-15 02:30:37] WhereIsMySpoon: it is less effort to write the tests from scratch
[2014-10-15 02:30:46] barancev: smellyhippy: generate c#/webdriver code, not c#/rc
[2014-10-15 02:31:09] WhereIsMySpoon: the generated code from the ide will give you bad habits
[2014-10-15 02:31:11] barancev: No More RC!
[2014-10-15 02:31:18] WhereIsMySpoon: olay
[2014-10-15 02:31:44] WhereIsMySpoon: even if you generate webdriver code, the locators will all be bloody xpath and you will have no waits
[2014-10-15 02:31:53] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: there is nothing evil in recorder
[2014-10-15 02:32:02] barancev: it records ids or names if possible
[2014-10-15 02:32:03] smellyhippy: I imagine that's probably correct once you know the tricks of the trade of creating sites that lend themselves to testing and know the commands and capabilities of selenium with some depth.
[2014-10-15 02:32:16] barancev: and you can tune it to prefer CSS over XPath
[2014-10-15 02:32:18] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-15 02:32:27] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: ive created suites of tests for sites that were never created for automated testing
[2014-10-15 02:32:33] smellyhippy: yeah ... it's using IDs just fine, and it gives you options for id/other css/xpath
[2014-10-15 02:32:37] WhereIsMySpoon: created with automated testing in mind*
[2014-10-15 02:32:59] smellyhippy: WhereIsMySpoon: can you give a concreate exmaple of where the IDE with manual clean up would fail?
[2014-10-15 02:33:42] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: im sure you could create a decent test given x amount of cleanup, its just that the effort involved in "cleaning up" each time is more than the effort you'd put in by starting it from scratch
[2014-10-15 02:34:14] WhereIsMySpoon: especially since when you export the code from the IDE, you dont get any of the nice patterns that selenium lends itself to
[2014-10-15 02:34:20] WhereIsMySpoon: like page objects
[2014-10-15 02:34:24] Dave_B_: I think (given manual cleanup is limitless in scope) that the normal problem is more maintainability - mostly people use things like page objects or similar to avoid having too hard a time keeping tests up to date with a changing product
[2014-10-15 02:34:32] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this
[2014-10-15 02:34:52] Dave_B_: pretty much just repeated you - but in my defence I started typing it before you said it, I'm jsut slow :p
[2014-10-15 02:35:06] barancev: btw, you can tune IDE format to generate page objects code
[2014-10-15 02:35:06] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: if you are trying to create a PoC with very limited time frame and just want something that works, then sure go ahead and do this export
[2014-10-15 02:35:15] barancev: recorder is just a tool
[2014-10-15 02:35:26] barancev: it is not evil in itself
[2014-10-15 02:35:37] WhereIsMySpoon: if you have time and effort and resources, start learning how to code the tests yourself
[2014-10-15 02:36:09] barancev: IDE is limited:
[2014-10-15 02:36:34] barancev: 1) no reuse, 2) no control flow, 3) no way to deal with element collections
[2014-10-15 02:37:22] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: I started the way you're trying to, and regretted it later
[2014-10-15 02:38:54] barancev: and, btw, Selenium Builder is better than Selenium IDE :)
[2014-10-15 02:39:11] WhereIsMySpoon: Builder is IDE's successor
[2014-10-15 02:39:14] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-10-15 02:40:05] smellyhippy: WhereIsMySpoon: my current experience is that the IDE gives me hints about whats availible and what approachs might work ... the code seems good to my noob eyes http://pastebin.com/STdrPjpd
[2014-10-15 02:41:35] smellyhippy: so I guess I want to look at the DOM elements created by the autocomplete and then use waitForElementPresent.
[2014-10-15 02:42:09] smellyhippy: I can't seem to find a wait/pause, and frankly watching for the element is much "safer".
[2014-10-15 02:42:09] WhereIsMySpoon: im not sure that standard autocomplete lists are in teh dom
[2014-10-15 02:42:21] barancev: smellyhippy: you'd better listen to what we told you and stop using RC :)

[2014-10-15 02:43:40] WhereIsMySpoon: also, I would avoid using such generic ids in your html as "date" and "time"
[2014-10-15 02:43:46] WhereIsMySpoon: recipe for disaster

[2014-10-15 02:45:35] WhereIsMySpoon: I didnt do that either

[2014-10-15 02:46:19] WhereIsMySpoon: the most important parts are waits, and if you want to start being organised already, the Page Object pattern
[2014-10-15 02:46:26] smellyhippy: I have yet to develop the ability to absorb knowledge via osmosis :S
[2014-10-15 02:46:40] WhereIsMySpoon: just look at the important parts and start hacking
[2014-10-15 02:46:51] [1]JP: I personally use it as a reference more than anything. There's plenty of tutorials out there to at least get you started
[2014-10-15 02:47:07] [1]JP: That gives you a platform to play about from there
[2014-10-15 02:47:36] WhereIsMySpoon: I have never ever in my life learned programming (a language, library or w/e) by reading all the documentation. I either use a tutorial and go through that, or read certain bits and start just coding

[2014-10-15 02:48:37] WhereIsMySpoon: I really recommend you do learn the page object pattern before you start coding serious tests though
[2014-10-15 02:48:44] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise you'll just haev to refactor them all later to use it

[2014-10-15 02:49:38] [1]JP: Don't do that
[2014-10-15 02:49:56] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: as I said earlier, automated testing requires effort and investment - it isn't just something you can start up and hope it all magically works and maeks your life 1000x better

[2014-10-15 02:52:08] WhereIsMySpoon: and how are you checking this
[2014-10-15 02:52:16] mondaycat: I put a breakpoint right after the browser starts
[2014-10-15 02:52:21] mondaycat: and then go to about:config
[2014-10-15 02:52:25] mondaycat: and it has the default values
[2014-10-15 02:52:28] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-10-15 02:52:51] smellyhippy: I understand that. I cirtainly think it's worth the investment when more time is availible. Unfortunatly right now I need to "bang these out" and I have no concreate examples of why this more expediant approach will fail for my current simple usage. I have a strong desire to learn "the right way", but just as you have ancedotes of doing thing the right way I have ancedotes of this apporahc
[2014-10-15 02:52:52] smellyhippy: working for me for other pages. Thank you very much for the advice and the guiding light! You all have been increadbly useful.
[2014-10-15 02:52:54] WhereIsMySpoon: that's much more useful than "it doesnt work" :) im still going to defer to someone with c# knowledge
[2014-10-15 02:53:32] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: that is unfortunate, and you will regret not having the time to properly structure and write your tests, but sometimes time isnt on your side
[2014-10-15 02:53:33] mondaycat: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah I'm terrible at explaining myself :P

[2014-10-15 02:56:13] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry if all this seems a little harsh, but the successors and later versions are there for a reason
[2014-10-15 02:56:33] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: then you need to either give him formal training or hire someone else who can write automated tests
[2014-10-15 02:56:53] WhereIsMySpoon: if you expect a manual QA guy to write automated tests you will have a lot of wasted time
[2014-10-15 02:56:58] WhereIsMySpoon: and a frustrated QA guy
[2014-10-15 02:57:22] smellyhippy: hah, you guys have been positivly cordial! you should see ##csharp when someone is trying to go against the flow ;)
[2014-10-15 02:58:10] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: we try out best to not be jerks, many programming channels are hostile
[2014-10-15 02:58:21] WhereIsMySpoon: the C channel, ##java, etc..
[2014-10-15 02:58:24] smellyhippy: he's starting to get he basics of C#, but I'm not sure how far he'll progress ... alas our company is a bit to small and in the middle of nowhere for hiring someone more skilled in that area. We have enough problems finding developers :/
[2014-10-15 02:59:01] smellyhippy: I like to think ##csharp is "better", the ops are cirtainly less trigger happy. But it still gets rough.
[2014-10-15 02:59:22] WhereIsMySpoon: never been there

[2014-10-15 04:01:35] smellyhippy: So when the IDE executes a script, it uses RC (Remote Control engine), rather than WebDriver (Web Driver engine). This means that things that work/fail on RC might behave differently on WebDriver? So when testing and debugging a script it should be done against the WebDriver to get an authorative result?
[2014-10-15 04:03:38] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: correct
[2014-10-15 04:07:13] smellyhippy: Good :) It turns out we are already using something close to the Pae Object pattern, though without the "fluent" API style.
[2014-10-15 04:07:20] smellyhippy: *Page
[2014-10-15 04:10:17] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: I see :) the fluent style makes the tests quite nice to read if you name your Page methods well
[2014-10-15 04:13:55] smellyhippy: Aye, C# is fluent heavy these days :) I inherited the web project from an ex-colegue whos no longer with us, and the tests from our tester who's not much of a coder. Apparently they spent some time on python *sigh* before realising that C# was probably a better idea since we're a C# house. I suspect the thought of method chaining didn't cross thier minds.
[2014-10-15 04:14:30] WhereIsMySpoon: python is nice enough
[2014-10-15 04:14:42] WhereIsMySpoon: but since you're a c# house that makes sense

[2014-10-15 06:23:55] WhereIsMySpoon: no worries, theres plenty of other websites to find jobs on if you google
[2014-10-15 06:23:56] smellyhippy: we are using the webdriver, and we are using the page object pattern ... we just use the IDE to help suggest the commands ;)
[2014-10-15 06:24:05] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: fair enough
[2014-10-15 06:24:28] Anki: hmm
[2014-10-15 06:25:04] smellyhippy: One key point I put in was testing and debugging with the WebDriver, don't trust the IDE to be anything more than a guide.
[2014-10-15 06:25:30] WhereIsMySpoon: quite, you dont get any of the richness that coding the tests brings

[2014-10-15 06:29:03] dimacus: 	smellyhippy by far the best way i've found to debug is to put a debugger in the part of the test that is giving you problems and walk through it in a real IDE (java) or IRB (ruby) you will find so many strange things… so fun

[2014-10-15 06:56:23] smellyhippy: Damn. So from what I'm reading the RemoteWebDriver has functionality for dealing with native file picker dialogs, but the others don't. It appears making the POST myself is the best option, so the data is avilible in future tests. The actual upload widget UI will need manual testing to ensure it's ability to create correct POSTs only.
[2014-10-15 06:56:49] smellyhippy: Makes sense, what with the file picker being an OS dialog ...
[2014-10-15 06:57:36] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: you're doin' it wrong
[2014-10-15 06:57:38] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-10-15 06:57:38] ato: You shouldn't interact with the file upload dialogue directly.
[2014-10-15 06:57:50] ato: It's an OS level widget and non-essential to your test.
[2014-10-15 06:57:52] WhereIsMySpoon: usually with file uploads you have an <input type="file" ...>
[2014-10-15 06:58:02] WhereIsMySpoon: just find that element and do sendKeys to it
[2014-10-15 06:58:13] WhereIsMySpoon: that will bypass the OS level dialogue and put the file in there
[2014-10-15 06:58:14] ato: If you're using Java you could use the LocalFileDetector and it will handle uploads across remotes transparently for you.
[2014-10-15 06:58:34] ato: There should be some equivalent for C#.
[2014-10-15 06:58:34] smellyhippy: WhereIsMySpoon_: and how will that upload via AJAX with specific headers set?
[2014-10-15 06:58:35] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this is part of the solution too
[2014-10-15 06:58:47] WhereIsMySpoon: why are you worrying about ajax
[2014-10-15 06:58:53] smellyhippy: LocalFileDetector is RemoteWebDriver from what I read
[2014-10-15 06:59:05] smellyhippy: because thats how the upload widget works
[2014-10-15 06:59:08] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: so?
[2014-10-15 06:59:16] smellyhippy: the <input type="file"> is simply an anchor fori t
[2014-10-15 06:59:17] WhereIsMySpoon: smellyhippy: are your users writing ajax calls to upload files?
[2014-10-15 06:59:25] WhereIsMySpoon: i doubt it
[2014-10-15 06:59:28] smellyhippy: no they're using an upload widget
[2014-10-15 06:59:31] WhereIsMySpoon: they are selecting the file through the dialogue and pressing "upload"
[2014-10-15 06:59:55] smellyhippy: they select 20 files and hit upload, then the upload widget adds headers and sends them up
[2014-10-15 07:00:11] jimevans, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-15 07:00:16] smellyhippy: it uses flash to read the files once it has the filepaths
[2014-10-15 07:00:20] WhereIsMySpoon: so what you do is driver.findElement(By.id("myFileTypeInput")).sendKeys(myFileName); driver.findElement(By.id("uploadBtn")).click();

[2014-10-15 07:19:49] CSWookie: For some reason it's taking 20 seconds to find an element by its id, I'm thinking that maybe it's not there the first couple of times it polls because the page isn't loaded yet, and so it backs off too much.
[2014-10-15 07:20:04] CSWookie: jimevans: Yup.
[2014-10-15 07:20:21] jimevans: CSWookie: which language, and what wait mechanism are you using?
[2014-10-15 07:20:42] CSWookie: Python, implicit.
[2014-10-15 07:21:22] ato: Read the source code?
[2014-10-15 07:21:55] CSWookie: ato: Are you asking if I have read the source code, or if you can read mine?
[2014-10-15 07:22:18] jimevans: yep, so if it's implicit waits, the actual polling mechanism is encoded inside the webdriver extension for firefox that gets added to the anonymous profile that webdriver uses when launching firefox.
[2014-10-15 07:23:01] jimevans: with explicit waits, the poll interval can be specifically set (in most language bindings)
[2014-10-15 07:23:31] jimevans: i'd have to look at the firefox driver source code to tell you what the poll interval is for implicit waits.
[2014-10-15 07:23:44] ato: The default implicit wait in Firefox is 0: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/wdsession.js#L104
[2014-10-15 07:24:48] ato: Oh the poll interval.
[2014-10-15 07:25:14] ato: It's 100 ms: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/firefoxDriver.js#L452

[2014-10-15 07:28:18] CSWookie: ato: Well, that can't be the case, here...  This stuff is all set when the profile is come up with at the beginning, you say, jimevans?
[2014-10-15 07:28:30] antsanto, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-15 07:28:49] ato: The FirefoxDriver XPI is injected as part of the profile.
[2014-10-15 07:28:50] jimevans: CSWookie: no, it's hard-coded into the driver.
[2014-10-15 07:29:02] jimevans: you get very very little control over implicit waits.
[2014-10-15 07:29:02] ato: Like jimevans says it's hardcoded in that .xpi.
[2014-10-15 07:29:19] ato: FWIW the poll interval isn't very important in the case of FirefoxDriver.
[2014-10-15 07:29:27] jimevans: (another reason to discard them in favor of explicit waits)
[2014-10-15 07:29:39] ato: Because it runs inside the browser it could skip the poll interval entirely.
[2014-10-15 07:30:02] CSWookie: I must be misunderstanding what's going on, then.  Are you guys saying that if the code doesn't find an element inside of 100 ms, it should error out?
[2014-10-15 07:30:14] jimevans: no
[2014-10-15 07:30:16] ato: Timeout != poll interval
[2014-10-15 07:30:35] ato: It will try to find the element at every poll interval until the timeout is elapsed.
[2014-10-15 07:30:44] CSWookie: But the timeout is 0, you said.
[2014-10-15 07:30:51] jimevans: by default, yes.

[2014-10-15 07:31:15] jimevans: if you set it using driver.timeouts.implicity_wait(), it gets set to whatever you set it to.
[2014-10-15 07:31:35] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-15 07:31:39] CSWookie: So, by default it should just error out, unless someone set another inplicit wait or their is an explicit wait going on?

[2014-10-15 07:32:23] ato: CSWookie: If you combine implicit- and explicit waits, you're going to have a bad time.

[2014-10-15 07:34:09] CSWookie: I wonder how hard it would be to modify the library (ours, not selenium's) to not use implicit waits, and rather just always set an explicit wait under the hood.
[2014-10-15 07:34:13] ato: Why am I not surprised jimevans has a curated answer to this (-:
[2014-10-15 07:34:33] jimevans: CSWookie: that's my preferred solution.

[2014-10-15 07:56:12] WhereIsMySpoon: well ofc
[2014-10-15 07:56:43] WhereIsMySpoon: I thought that selenium parsed urls to get() into URLs internally though
[2014-10-15 07:56:45] jimevans: i strongly suspect that dialog is a result of calling IWebBrowser2::Navigate()
[2014-10-15 07:57:04] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: depends on the langauge.
[2014-10-15 07:57:06] WhereIsMySpoon: im pretty sure the java bindings do at least
[2014-10-15 07:57:34] ato: If do, we should stop doing that.
[2014-10-15 07:57:38] ato: If we do.
[2014-10-15 07:57:40] WhereIsMySpoon: i might be completely wrong
[2014-10-15 07:57:43] WhereIsMySpoon: let me check
[2014-10-15 07:58:51] jimevans: for .NET, driver.Navigate().GoToUrl() takes a System.Uri object in one overload.
[2014-10-15 07:59:35] WhereIsMySpoon: its just String in java
[2014-10-15 07:59:58] WhereIsMySpoon: for htmlunitdriver it does parse it into a URL object

[2014-10-15 08:02:17] WhereIsMySpoon: just .get(String s)
[2014-10-15 08:02:40] jimevans: htmlunit's navigation method may require the use of a url object.
[2014-10-15 08:02:47] WhereIsMySpoon: tbh, I think having .get on webdriver and then all the other things in navigate is a bit weird
[2014-10-15 08:03:02] WhereIsMySpoon: especially when navigate.to() is a synonym for .get
[2014-10-15 08:03:18] WhereIsMySpoon: literally, webdriver.navigate.to calls webdriver.get

[2014-10-15 09:45:45] Dave_B_: Spiffing what.
[2014-10-15 09:45:46] brockfredin: Testing in multiple browsers:  In the past, I've used a .config file and passed one single browser in at a time.  Anyway good strategies for testing browserA and immediately after the entire suit finishes, testing the same functionalities with BrowserB, and BrowserC?  Have an enum set: nrowserID and numberOfBrowsers? and pass in Number of Browsers and do a testTeardown: if(numberOfBrowsers
[2014-10-15 09:45:46] brockfredin: > 1 //go to next browser )
[2014-10-15 09:46:04] Dave_B_: personally I just have separate jenkins runs
[2014-10-15 09:46:24] jimevans: yeah, i'd manage that with my CI system.
[2014-10-15 09:46:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-10-15 09:47:04] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont really want a test report for all browsers in one
[2014-10-15 09:47:14] brockfredin: Thanks guys.  Do you even have capacity to set the browser in your runs or are you just hard coding the driver for each Jenkins instance?
[2014-10-15 09:47:18] WhereIsMySpoon: especially if some browsers are more important to your clients than others
[2014-10-15 09:47:40] WhereIsMySpoon: you can send it as a system param for example -DbrowserToUse=chrome
[2014-10-15 09:47:48] WhereIsMySpoon: then parse that in your code
[2014-10-15 09:48:04] WhereIsMySpoon: if you use gradle that is
[2014-10-15 09:48:11] WhereIsMySpoon: (I do)
[2014-10-15 09:48:17] cgoldberg: environment vars ftw
[2014-10-15 09:48:17] Dave_B_: I set an env variable then read it
[2014-10-15 09:48:26] WhereIsMySpoon: ya that works too
[2014-10-15 09:48:52] brockfredin: Best to start with two brosers?
[2014-10-15 09:49:01] cgoldberg: best to start with one ;)
[2014-10-15 09:49:03] brockfredin: We only have IE, Firefox, and Chrome.  Any safari capabilities yet?
[2014-10-15 09:49:13] brockfredin: I realize Blink was forked from webkit.
[2014-10-15 09:49:16] WhereIsMySpoon: there was a safaridriver, but it was merged into chromedriver i think
[2014-10-15 09:49:21] WhereIsMySpoon: cause safari is now using webkit
[2014-10-15 09:49:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or into firefoxdriver
[2014-10-15 09:49:34] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont remember which
[2014-10-15 09:50:03] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba made safaridriver but it hasnt been updated for a long time iirc
[2014-10-15 09:50:16] brockfredin: I need to do a sign-off with decision makers to see if they decide between (chrome, IE) or (Chrome, Firefox) or (Firefox, IE)
[2014-10-15 09:50:26] WhereIsMySpoon: ie sucks
[2014-10-15 09:50:35] WhereIsMySpoon: (still)
[2014-10-15 09:50:49] cgoldberg: brockfredin, why don't you analyze your traffic and see what your users actually are using.. and then test those
[2014-10-15 09:50:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this
[2014-10-15 09:51:06] WhereIsMySpoon: making arbitrary decisions isnt very useful

[2014-10-15 11:08:47] ato: Oh like that.  You should probably print the stack trace to the logger.

[2014-10-15 11:10:22] ato: Exception(message, stacktrace).
[2014-10-15 11:10:50] simonstewart: Cheerio
[2014-10-15 11:10:52] ato: toString() might have what you're after.

[2014-10-15 11:11:09] ato: Otherwise you need to go printStackTrace(PrintStream) and then dump that into the log message.
[2014-10-15 11:11:35] dimacus: "message of {@code (cause==null ? null : cause.toString())} (which
[2014-10-15 11:11:35] dimacus:      * typically contains the class and detail message of {@code cause})"
[2014-10-15 11:11:58] ato: Ah, Guava has a convenience function you can use.
[2014-10-15 11:12:30] dimacus: yeah this is in selenium core code though, i don't feel comfortable adding 3rd party dependencies
[2014-10-15 11:12:43] ato: log.severe(String.format("Something bad happened: %s\n%s, t.getMessage(), Throwables.getStackTraceAsString(t)))
[2014-10-15 11:12:57] ato: It's grid?  That's not core code AFAIK.
[2014-10-15 11:13:08] dimacus: ohh
[2014-10-15 11:13:16] dimacus: i like the stack trace as string
[2014-10-15 11:13:39] ato: Also it should be in the same call go log.

[2014-10-15 11:14:45] ato: Two reasons for that: There could be race conditions in concurrent programs (this is a concurrent program), and the log entry you're making could be considered a single entity.
[2014-10-15 11:15:01] dimacus: yeah especially when multi threaded

[2014-10-15 11:22:05] dimacus: oh shoot
[2014-10-15 11:22:08] ato: Looks good though, these are just style issues.

[2014-10-15 11:28:24] dimacus: why?
[2014-10-15 11:28:25] ato: It's superfluous now that you log it.
[2014-10-15 11:28:30] dimacus: kk
[2014-10-15 11:28:44] ato: This is printing the stack twice to stdout.
[2014-10-15 11:28:59] dimacus: actually not
[2014-10-15 11:29:10] dimacus: when you do t.printStackTrace() to goes to stderror
[2014-10-15 11:29:29] ato: Okay, well I imagine log.severe does too.

[2014-10-15 11:34:04] ato: Commit message rules also have style to them.
[2014-10-15 11:34:20] ato: Generally the whole message should be imperative, not talking about the past.
[2014-10-15 11:34:37] ato: The first line should be short and below 80 characters or thereabouts.
[2014-10-15 11:34:38] dimacus: hmm intersting thought
[2014-10-15 11:34:57] ato: The remaining message should now exceed 80 characters, and should have a blank line above it to separate it from the main message.
[2014-10-15 11:35:24] ato: s/now/nt/
[2014-10-15 11:35:27] ato: s/nt/not/
[2014-10-15 11:35:30] dimacus: sounds reasonable
[2014-10-15 11:35:44] dimacus: i wonder if someone wrote a phd thesis on commit messages
[2014-10-15 11:36:02] ato: Someone probably did.
[2014-10-15 11:36:08] dimacus: :)
[2014-10-15 11:36:19] ato: It's not a hard rule though.
[2014-10-15 11:36:22] ato: Just nice to keep in mind.
[2014-10-15 11:36:29] dimacus: yeah sounds easy to follow
[2014-10-15 11:36:54] ato: The main reason I hate long first-line commit messages is that it makes it hard to understand what a patch is doing just by glancing over `git shortlog`.
[2014-10-15 11:37:09] ato: If I need more information I can use `git log` to see the full explanation.
[2014-10-15 11:37:17] dimacus: maybe we should look up all e.printStackTrace() and replace them with a log output? i feel like so many stack traces are swallowed meaning and making it hard to debug edge cases
[2014-10-15 11:37:44] ato: Sure.  That seems like a logical next step.
[2014-10-15 11:38:17] dimacus: if i have free time i'll take a look, i need to now debug the corrupted session issue not being released, it's crashing my grid every 2 days or so
