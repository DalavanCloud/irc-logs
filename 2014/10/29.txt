[2014-10-29 02:19:42] arex\\: I'm considering including the Selenium server in my git repo so that running the Selenium tests locally will be trivial for all developers. However, I'm wondering how to start and stop the Selenium server automatically (before/after test execution)
[2014-10-29 02:23:07] arex\\: I assume I can make sure the server is running in the TestInitialize in my base test class, but what about stopping the server? I would like to run my tests in parallel of course

[2014-10-29 03:55:46] sgsabbage: random question about selenium hub. How does it utilise multiple nodes? For example, if I have two nodes connected to hub (both windows, both with chrome) and I request two chrome sessions, will it a) Create both chrome sessions on the same node. b) Try and round-robin and create a session on each node. c) Choose randomly. d) Undefined
[2014-10-29 03:59:05] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: unless you explicitly multithread your tests, they will not be spread across multiple nodes and run in parallel
[2014-10-29 03:59:46] sgsabbage: oh, I know that - I'm handling multi-threading in the test code
[2014-10-29 04:01:30] sgsabbage: We do a lot of multi-session testing as it is as we need to see the behaviours that occur when two users interact - but specifically I want to know if I add another node to my grid, will it try and balance session requests across them or will it try and fill up a node at a time
[2014-10-29 04:03:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ah I see
[2014-10-29 04:03:52] WhereIsMySpoon: im not sure really sorry
[2014-10-29 04:04:21] WhereIsMySpoon: that would be a question for the actual selenium devs :)
[2014-10-29 04:04:47] sgsabbage: :D
[2014-10-29 04:04:52] sgsabbage: I'll read through the code
[2014-10-29 04:14:41] sgsabbage: hmm, can tell I've not done Java in a while, NetBeans is rather out of date

[2014-10-29 04:14:51] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-10-29 04:17:25] Dave_B_: sgsabbage: each request for a node will come in, the first one will go to a free node (it's not actually random but let's pretend) then the second one comes in and it'll allocate the other node an it's the only free one remaining
[2014-10-29 04:17:47] Dave_B_: if you requested e.g. 4 it doesn't allocate 2 each, it allocates one to each free node then queues the rest
[2014-10-29 04:18:05] sgsabbage: but, I can have 5 (chrome, at least) sessions per node, yes?
[2014-10-29 04:18:13] Dave_B_: oh right
[2014-10-29 04:18:21] Dave_B_: sorry misinterpretted your question
[2014-10-29 04:18:29] Dave_B_: i think it doesn't try to balance them
[2014-10-29 04:18:37] sgsabbage: that was my worry, yeah
[2014-10-29 04:18:48] Dave_B_: i run single session nodes
[2014-10-29 04:18:50] sgsabbage: ahh
[2014-10-29 04:18:54] Dave_B_: so am not really sure sorry
[2014-10-29 04:19:10] sgsabbage: no problem - I mean, that's an option, I could just set the max sessions on each node
[2014-10-29 04:19:18] sgsabbage: (or, on the hub, since it'll inherit)

[2014-10-29 04:21:41] Dave_B_: 2 user interaction testing is a pain, I wish you well! Has the theoretical possibility of locking up the grid I guess if a bunch of tests grab their first user, take all free nodes, then try and grab their second user and all sit in the queue waiting for nodes that are waiting on them. :/
[2014-10-29 04:22:09] sgsabbage: yeah
[2014-10-29 04:22:16] Dave_B_: or, the grid isn't locked up, it'll recover, but the tests get borked :(
[2014-10-29 04:22:25] sgsabbage: fortunately, the grid is only used for this at the moment, so I can control how many tests are running at once
[2014-10-29 04:22:30] Dave_B_: :)
[2014-10-29 04:22:41] Dave_B_: makes life easier
[2014-10-29 04:22:43] sgsabbage: but in future I could certainly see that being an issue!

[2014-10-29 04:26:12] sgsabbage: basically, my problem at the moment is it's very small scale - I have a hub and a single node. Running our full test suite one test at a time takes 20 minutes. Running it two tests at a time (well, two processes), it takes 19 minutes, and I'm pretty sure the slowdown is on the client side
[2014-10-29 04:26:25] arex\\, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-29 04:27:31] sgsabbage: my intention is to add a second node to see if it will speed up, but if it fills up one node at a time, it's completely pointless :D
[2014-10-29 04:27:37] sgsabbage: unless, of course, I set maxSessions
[2014-10-29 04:29:06] Dave_B_: yeah, it can be a bit of a pain getting buy-in for scaling
[2014-10-29 04:32:15] sgsabbage: if it halves the time of the testing suite I have buy-in on the fact that it makes it cheaper ;)

[2014-10-29 11:24:33] jleyba: yosito: another trick is to preface your script with a "debugger;" statement. pause your test right before executeScript() and open the developer tools console. then resume the test and you should trigger the browser's JS debugger

[2014-10-29 12:02:59] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-29 12:03:14] dimacus: is that happening when the browser page load took too long so the session is terminated?
[2014-10-29 12:05:38] dimacus: barancev: i swear i spent last 2 months chasing down the SO_TIMEOUT issues with IE8 and if that's what it is, this will make me so happy
[2014-10-29 12:07:10] barancev: may be it can happen in this case, but just because IE driver does not implement "eager" page loading strategy
[2014-10-29 12:07:42] barancev: if the driver does not respond, after a timeout the node makes a decisin that it is *socket* timeout
[2014-10-29 12:07:47] barancev: actualy it is not
[2014-10-29 12:08:04] dimacus: oh this makes so much sense!!!
[2014-10-29 12:08:20] dimacus: and why it only happens in IE8 and no other browser
[2014-10-29 12:08:57] barancev: who knows :)
[2014-10-29 12:09:30] barancev: because IE8 can't understand that the page is completely loaded?
[2014-10-29 12:09:31] dimacus: ok i'm gonna play with this a little if this is gonna fix the damn issue, i swear i'm gonna send you a bottle of good Virginia Apple sider

[2014-10-29 18:40:21] raj_: Hi. I am running selenium (with C#). The problem is code that works on Firefox/Chrome, fails on IE. When I was looking at the HTML, it looks like on click of a button, a div gets added. Now wait for element exist/visible is timing out everytime
[2014-10-29 18:41:50] raj_: Anyone got any solution to this?

[2014-10-29 18:48:06] sirsteef: implicit wait not set high enough for shitty IE? could do a pastebin or something and someone will eventually be 'round to gander helpfully, raj_
[2014-10-29 18:53:08] raj_: thanks sirsteef, will check if that works
[2014-10-29 18:56:23] sirsteef: is it right after a pageload?
[2014-10-29 18:57:41] raj_: it is modaldialog inside that div gets added to webpage after button click
