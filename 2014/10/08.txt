[2014-10-08 11:28:22] ato: It should say “Jo flere kokker, dess mer søl.”
[2014-10-08 11:28:23] nirvdrum: I'll take a look.  As fair warning, my default stance has been no API simply because there are too many different use cases and writing a custom servlet for your own needs is fairly trivial.
[2014-10-08 11:28:24] dimacus: but who can read that?

[2014-10-08 11:28:51] nirvdrum: There was an existing PR to add an API and it had a bunch of performance-related problems that would cripple any non-trivially sized grid.
[2014-10-08 11:29:02] lukeis: jleyba: you're always harsh ;)
[2014-10-08 11:29:04] ato: I'm impressed that Google Translate is able to understand sayings.
[2014-10-08 11:29:19] ato: It's not a direct translation.
[2014-10-08 11:29:34] dimacus: nirvdrum: yeah my only fear is that internal API might hcange and servlet will get out of date, but if you feel so strongly about it, i don't mind scraping it all together
[2014-10-08 11:29:36] ato: jleyba: Oh and hey there.
[2014-10-08 11:29:45] ato: jleyba: I wanted to ask you some questions about FirefoxDriver.
[2014-10-08 11:29:49] lukeis: jleyba: and no… not at all
[2014-10-08 11:29:56] jleyba: lukeis: Really? I don't try to be
[2014-10-08 11:29:59] jleyba: Unless it's about Se 1.0
[2014-10-08 11:30:10] nirvdrum: dimacus: I'll take a look.  Maybe you found the magical answer :-)
[2014-10-08 11:30:37] ato: jleyba: Do you know why nsICommandProcessor is a component?  Does that bear some special significance?
[2014-10-08 11:31:17] dimacus: nirvdrum: probably not, i wasn't trying too hard to make it optimized, just working, but don't mind scraping it all together and making it use resources more tamely
[2014-10-08 11:31:32] jleyba: ato: At one point, yes. Now no
[2014-10-08 11:31:33] lukeis: jleyba: i'm in a joking mood. honestly i find your normal interactions with users are straight to the point and cutting out all bullshit :)
[2014-10-08 11:31:41] nirvdrum: dimacus: E.g., the new console takes minutes to render for me.
[2014-10-08 11:31:49] nirvdrum: That's if it doesn't timeout first.
[2014-10-08 11:31:54] dimacus: nirvdrum: yeah i have a bug filed for that
[2014-10-08 11:32:02] jleyba: ato: nsICommandProcessor used to be exposed to the content page as a global javascript object.
[2014-10-08 11:32:26] dimacus: nirvdrum: after digging around i realized that #8002 causes it
[2014-10-08 11:32:28] selbot2_: 03---- open/New Grid Console dead locks if nodes are unreachable - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=8002 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged Component-Grid ]
[2014-10-08 11:32:46] dimacus: nirvdrum: so i figure by doing a simple REST api and making the console do async calls we can prevent the lock ups
[2014-10-08 11:33:09] nirvdrum: dimacus: When I last looked it had to do with hitting the "about" end point on each node.
[2014-10-08 11:33:16] nirvdrum: In serial.  As the page renders.
[2014-10-08 11:33:30] nirvdrum: s/In serial/Serially/
[2014-10-08 11:33:34] dimacus: yeah
[2014-10-08 11:33:48] dimacus: and if node disapears while this is happening you can add up to 5min per hit on the /status
[2014-10-08 11:33:54] dimacus: before moving to next node
[2014-10-08 11:33:59] nirvdrum: Oh, that's nice too.
[2014-10-08 11:34:09] dimacus: so you can double cripple it :)
[2014-10-08 11:34:12] ato: jleyba: And I'm struggling to understand how it deals with alerts and modal dialogues.  So it spoofs the PromptService so that window.alert first triggers an internal state to be set, then the alert to be created.  Every command is then as I understand it delayed using window.setTimeout(func, 0).
[2014-10-08 11:34:35] ato: jleyba: Does this ensure it gets executed on a different thread and so returned before the alert is created?
[2014-10-08 11:34:36] dimacus: nirvdrum: part of the reason i'm thinking the console should be rendered with minimum info, and just pulls updates 1 node at the time in parallel
[2014-10-08 11:34:57] jleyba: ato: a little more context. waaaay back, the very first version of webdriverjs controlled the FirefoxDriver directly via the exposed nsICommandProcessor. I changed it to to communicate over the DOM to support the original ChromeDriver. When that died, I never changed it back (and I don't think XPCOM supports exposing controls to the content page anymore)
[2014-10-08 11:35:51] jleyba: ato: Sorry, I'm not that familiar with the alert handling or cert overriding stuff.  IIRC, it can take a few seconds for PromptService to notice an alert was opened
[2014-10-08 11:37:01] nirvdrum: dimacus: Yeah.  The other problem is a couple times now people have contributed patches to the console that assume JSON has a structure they shouldn't assume.  So if you add selendroid, ios-driver, whatever and they have a different response format, the console blows up.
[2014-10-08 11:37:33] dimacus: good to know
[2014-10-08 11:37:46] dimacus: if this is to happen, it would require a million tests
[2014-10-08 11:38:22] dimacus: for now though, just simply knowing how many sessions, nodes, and what session is on what node will make debuging so much simpler
[2014-10-08 11:38:40] ato: jleyba: So window.alert locks up the current JS context.  I guess I'm wondering what effect window.setTimeout would have when an alert is created whilst that is processing.

[2014-10-08 11:39:15] jleyba: ato: window.alert would lock up the content page's JS context. The extension runs in its own context, doesn't it?
[2014-10-08 11:39:18] nirvdrum: dimacus: Anyway, I'll try to review this soon.

[2014-10-08 11:40:10] dimacus: nirvdrum: haha thanks, well my 2nd choise is just to add another servlet and attach it at will
[2014-10-08 11:40:25] ato: jleyba: I'm not sure to be quite honest.
[2014-10-08 11:40:32] nirvdrum: I have a custom servlet, but it gets data from a custom proxy too.
[2014-10-08 11:40:34] ato: jleyba: XPCOM isn't exactly well specced.
[2014-10-08 11:40:39] jleyba: every time you write a new servlet, a kitten/puppy/insert your favorite cuddly thing dies

[2014-10-08 11:41:02] ato: jleyba: That was very useful!
[2014-10-08 11:41:21] dimacus: nirvdrum: yeah, any chance you have a serlvet or a proxy that logs session -> host? like a history? I wanna be able to see what tests ran on node1 in last 24 hours

[2014-10-08 11:43:11] dimacus: yeah but then i'll have to parse the full log, what i'm thinking is an endpoint, when using Jenkins to go through the builds in Jenkins, pull the session id from info, go unto the node, grab the video of the test, archive it as an artifact
[2014-10-08 11:43:29] dimacus: don't really want to go through the whole log to parse those bits out

[2014-10-08 13:56:30] dimacus: yeah should be
[2014-10-08 13:56:37] dimacus: what are you looking for?

[2014-10-08 13:58:34] dimacus: hmmm well let's just say that i spent only first 5 pages in the IDE and then dumped it in the garbage
[2014-10-08 13:58:34] dude-x: one book showed me something cool (it was just a snippet) but with the python bindings you can use a webelement's id attribute to check for stalenss
[2014-10-08 13:58:39] dimacus: jimevans: as of last week :)

[2014-10-08 14:20:08] ato: jimevans: Oh that's quite common in old Unix software.
[2014-10-08 14:20:29] jimevans: oh, yeah. i'm aware.

[2014-10-08 14:24:49] *lukeis did a fair share of academia in different assembly languages'
[2014-10-08 14:25:08] ato: dimacus: Don't be sorry.

[2014-10-08 14:25:53] dimacus: just think how crazy fast iedriver would be if it was written in assembly
[2014-10-08 14:25:53] lukeis: you certainly can optimize the hell out of it...
[2014-10-08 14:26:06] lukeis: and very hard to debug ;)
[2014-10-08 14:26:13] ato: Depends on the complexity of the C library, but not necessarily.
[2014-10-08 14:26:32] jimevans: if C is shooting oneself in the foot, assembly is machining the cartridge, packing the powder, crimping the round, boring the barrel, filing the firing pin, and putting the whole lot together to pull the trigger.
[2014-10-08 14:27:19] lukeis: my first job was in python… and we had some injected C code we wrote… that dropped down to assembly coding for optimization (for indexing large data sets)…. yes, we had to standardize on the hardware everywhere to make that work :)
[2014-10-08 14:28:41] ato: There's a wonderful interview with Bernie Cosell in Coders at Work who worked at BBN on ARPANET.  They used to hotpatch, as in modify the memory addresses of the running program in Assembly, and keep revisions in a notebook.
[2014-10-08 14:28:50] ato: Every so and then they would shut down the program to apply the patches.
[2014-10-08 14:30:29] dimacus: that sounds like a halloween story someone would say with a flashlight
[2014-10-08 14:31:18] ato: Hehe.
[2014-10-08 14:32:03] ato: My point is that people would be surprised by how much of the internet is run on tape and paperclips.
[2014-10-08 14:32:47] dimacus: ahhh my favorite bit from IT crowd: "Why does Jen have the internet in her hands!! Be careful, you can break it for everyone"

[2014-10-08 15:28:22] jimevans: i've done at least four. :)
[2014-10-08 15:28:34] jimevans: no, wait. five.
[2014-10-08 15:28:43] lukeis: ios-driver, selendroid, firefox for me thus far
[2014-10-08 15:29:12] jimevans: ios-driver, firefox, IE, windows phone (mobile web), windows phone hybrid.
[2014-10-08 15:29:22] jimevans: and yeah, the last two are separate drivers.
[2014-10-08 15:30:38] KyleG: it seems like
[2014-10-08 15:30:42] KyleG: there's no extension installed
[2014-10-08 15:30:56] KyleG: It's supposed to install itself automatically isn't it
[2014-10-08 15:31:02] KyleG: when you run tests
[2014-10-08 15:31:09] jimevans: could be apple messed with the way extensions are installed in newest safari.
[2014-10-08 15:31:19] jimevans: changed the pref file or something.
[2014-10-08 15:31:36] lukeis: yeah, i've seen that issue reported (internally here) already
[2014-10-08 15:32:09] lukeis: manually installing gets them further
[2014-10-08 15:32:59] KyleG: yeah that's the next step

[2014-10-08 18:23:12] CSWookie: Hey all, I could use some help with optimizing my test for speed.  it seems like it's taking a long time to find elements that aren't interactable (rows, tables, etc) than those that are.
[2014-10-08 18:25:35] CSWookie: I'm writing a programming language so we can write selenium tests in english, and it all works fine, except the verification commands (which involve determining if an element exists or doesn't) are very slow.  It's odd, because they use the same sort of logic as that used to get buttons and such.

[2014-10-08 18:43:06] CSWookie: I don't know how meaningful it would be.  The test itself is English.  I could make the code print out the xpaths it's using and how long each of them is taking, I suppose.  And the results file does have timiing information on how long each line of the test took to run.
[2014-10-08 18:44:18] CSWookie: I'll see about putting a copy of the results up on a paste site.  At least then you can see what sorts of activities take a long time.

[2014-10-08 18:50:27] CSWookie: The things that are checkmarked are sections, there's no timing information just for them.
[2014-10-08 18:50:35] CSWookie: Although I might add that.
