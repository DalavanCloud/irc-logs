[2014-10-24 01:31:18] afx237: this is a fairly ignorant question, so i might be missing some very basic point.... but why doesn't selenium have a more universal command language like SQL, or better yet just supply the webdriver with a JSON array for each command with options?  it seems that it would negate the need for various language formatters etc in the IDE, and everybody would be working on and supporting one "interface" basically rather than having all these quirks and
[2014-10-24 01:31:18] afx237: differents between programming languages/frameworks used to write webdriver scripts.  often when i'm exporting language specific code from the firefox IDE, it won't be able to give me the command in whatever language/framework i've chosen because that language/framework doesn't support the command yet.  why should every framework need custom code for every selenium command?
[2014-10-24 01:34:08] afx237: it seems like a massive amount of re-inventing the wheel

[2014-10-24 01:40:44] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: and just how are you going to manage control flow, functions, classes, callbacks and lots more in something like SQL or json
[2014-10-24 01:43:34] afx237: you'd still be writing custom condition code in your language of course, but that's outside of the interaction with selenium, which is basically getting things such as HTML elements etc, and performing actions on them.  i.e. everything the IDE generates
[2014-10-24 01:44:36] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: the IDE is not really a valid base from which to argue - it's old, uses deprecated technology and doesnt provide anywhere near the functionality that webdriver provides

[2014-10-24 01:45:53] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: of course, if everyone in the world used 1 programming language it would make it easier :p

[2014-10-24 01:46:27] *Dave_B_ waves good morning'
[2014-10-24 01:48:05] afx237: ok thanks, i'll take a look into page model.   i'm actually coding in PHP, so that makes things a bit harder than the main supported languages.  so do a lot of people no longer really use the IDE to get started with new scripts these days?
[2014-10-24 01:49:08] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: yea php is not really a good language to write selenium tests with
[2014-10-24 01:49:21] WhereIsMySpoon: there are like 5 differetn bindings

[2014-10-24 01:50:20] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: I assume you can code already?
[2014-10-24 01:50:35] *WhereIsMySpoon waves at Dave_B_'
[2014-10-24 01:51:08] afx237: yeah if i was purely testing stuff, i'd probably use python or something.   but my stuff is scraping for a PHP app, so makes sense to keep it within the app.
[2014-10-24 01:51:31] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: Actually I've kept my selenium stuff totally separate from my app
[2014-10-24 01:51:40] WhereIsMySpoon: I think its a better approach
[2014-10-24 01:52:12] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: ah wait are you usign selenium as part of your app? and not just for testing?
[2014-10-24 01:53:10] afx237: yeah just scraping stuff to pull into my db at the moment.   but i will get into testing in the future.
[2014-10-24 01:53:25] WhereIsMySpoon: there are much better tools for web scraping than selenium
[2014-10-24 01:53:57] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is designed with a test-oriented approach, so you may find yourself at loggerheads with it, especially with regards to performance and long-term stability
[2014-10-24 01:54:40] afx237: to be specific, i'm automatically downloading CSVs from my bank accounts.  i hate how shitty all internet banking systems are, they always make it hard to mass export data etc.
[2014-10-24 01:56:22] afx237: stupid limitations on how far back you can go etc.  and the bank i've been working on the last couple of days has such ridiculous html/js to interact with.  doing crazy stuff like hiding a showing separate "submit" buttons based on which <select> <option> is chosen etc.   maybe they make it hard on purpose.
[2014-10-24 01:57:54] sgsabbage, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-24 01:58:16] WhereIsMySpoon: afx237: a lot of the time the bad html/js/css is because they have to support legacy browsers
[2014-10-24 01:58:22] afx237: but they've probably just used some mental code generator.  all the id names are crazy crap like id="pt1:r1:0:uipt1:subForm:s2s3h", and it's all really inconsistent. the ids are completely different depending on which account i look at, or which filetype i'm exporting etc.   phun times. =)

[2014-10-24 05:48:24] WhereIsMySpoon: it is not possible for it to trigger on anything else
[2014-10-24 05:48:29] barancev: Dave_B_: compare: you can run our game IF your computer has > 2G RAM
[2014-10-24 05:48:57] barancev: that means -- you can try to run it with 1,G, but it can work slow or unstable
[2014-10-24 05:48:59] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Yeah, I can see it being a useful distinction if you have two conditions.
[2014-10-24 05:49:13] barancev: and you can run our game IFF your comuter is > 2G RAM
[2014-10-24 05:49:31] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: but in that case thats language symantics or ambiguity
[2014-10-24 05:49:32] barancev: that means -- the program will not work if you have less
[2014-10-24 05:49:56] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: basically you're talking about the diff between min specs and recommended specs
[2014-10-24 05:50:07] Dave_B_: barancev: All the languages I use will only pass an if check if the condition is met
[2014-10-24 05:50:13] Dave_B_: without it being an iff
[2014-10-24 05:50:14] WhereIsMySpoon: in programming, if(something) is final and will only work if 'something' is true
[2014-10-24 05:50:24] Dave_B_: (ok, some fallthrough cases are odd)
[2014-10-24 05:51:23] Dave_B_: I understand the difference between if & if and only in english semantics :)
[2014-10-24 05:52:03] barancev: natural language is informal, true

[2014-10-24 08:27:07] jimevans: part of the problem is that i'm hot-patching the assembly with custom MSIL statements. which means that debugging in the IDE is impossible (because the symbol files are not valid anymore)

[2014-10-24 08:29:22] ato: I'd like to think we have progressed since then.
[2014-10-24 08:29:22] jimevans: that was when software was developed by Real Programmers
[2014-10-24 08:29:29] ato: But sometimes when I hear war stories like this I do wonder (-:

[2014-10-24 08:31:03] jimevans: i'm working on a driver for windows rt apps, but need to be able to inject the driver code into an app so that there's a communication channel that the language bindings can use to communicate. and i don't want target apps to have to compile the driver into their code.
[2014-10-24 08:31:47] jimevans: so i'm trying to be a little clever, maybe too clever by half, but it seems to partially work.

[2014-10-24 12:21:08] lukeis: ato: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#reading-element-state  it seems like an element is pre-defined with x/y, height width… and we don't have wire endpoints to get the latest value?
[2014-10-24 12:21:53] ato: Latest value of what?
[2014-10-24 12:22:02] lukeis: current value
[2014-10-24 12:22:11] lukeis: you know, cause it can change :)
[2014-10-24 12:22:40] ato: I don't know what you mean by “latest” and “value”. (-:
[2014-10-24 12:22:53] lukeis: the getSize / getLocation
[2014-10-24 12:23:29] lukeis: element.x == 30  initially… but later (via javascript) is updated to 50… how does the spec represent getting the 'latest' value (50)
[2014-10-24 12:23:35] ato: Okay, well yeah those seem to be missing.
[2014-10-24 12:25:04] ato: The internal algorithms of the spec shouldn't rely on algorithms from other commands.
[2014-10-24 12:25:41] ato: So if one command needs to check an element's x,y coordinates, it should do so individually of a getLocation command defined in WebDriver.
[2014-10-24 12:25:55] ato: Even though the two might rely on the same procedure to calculate x,y.
[2014-10-24 12:26:19] ato: In case they do, that procedure should be made a definition in the spec.
[2014-10-24 12:26:27] ato: I may be reading you wrong?
[2014-10-24 12:26:37] lukeis: not quite following :)  but all I see is the endpoints not exisitng
[2014-10-24 12:26:48] ato: The endpoints are indeed missing.
[2014-10-24 12:27:20] ato: If there's not a bug, feel free to file one.
[2014-10-24 12:27:22] ato: Or better yet, fix it (-:

[2014-10-24 12:27:46] ato: That's very annoying.
[2014-10-24 12:27:52] ato: I rely on Firefox to remember it for me now.
[2014-10-24 12:28:10] lukeis: well, my browser did remember one… just apparently not the right one :-/

[2014-10-24 12:57:19] ato: Hah yes.  My previous employer uses their mail solution, and then suddenly you were denied access to Hangouts which was very bizarre.

[2014-10-24 12:58:05] ato: Also I was told by a Googler from Colorado last year that their multi-account solution wasn't really very good.  Which kind of was my point when I talked to him.
[2014-10-24 12:58:54] AutomatedTester: wasn't really good/ a big piling piece of 💩
[2014-10-24 12:59:11] ato: Well yeah.
