[2014-10-07 01:40:41] sz332: i run into the following issue. I have a gwt application, and wrote a bunch of web tests. Now i run into a situation that i have a "dialog" and i want to press a button. But somehow selenium does not presses it. It founds it (no exception) sends the click command, but in reality, the click command is not executed. I can execute the click "by hand". Any idea where to look?

[2014-10-07 01:48:15] swypych, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-07 01:48:15] WhereIsMySpoon: also, are you sure you're clicking on the correct element? as in, if you get the locator you're using, and try and do the exact same thing via javascript in the browser console, does it work?
[2014-10-07 01:48:31] sz332: good question, but i have multiple buttons on that dialog, and the press works for them, but not for this one
[2014-10-07 01:48:33] WhereIsMySpoon: say you're doing driver.findElement(By.id("someid")).click(), try doing $('#someid').click()
[2014-10-07 01:48:41] WhereIsMySpoon: and see if it works
[2014-10-07 01:48:53] sz332: i am thinking about something
[2014-10-07 01:48:56] WhereIsMySpoon: with whatever locator you're using

[2014-10-07 07:31:00] whitby_: Hey all, I'm having an issue that I _think_ is with Selenium. I'm using Coypu (https://github.com/featurist/coypu) which uses v2.43.0 (http://git.io/CH3pJw) and I am getting inconsistent results across a) browsers (beyond the obvious cross browser issues) and b) test invocations. Does anyone have ideas as to what the best way to diagnose/debug these issues is?
[2014-10-07 07:31:33] whitby_: For example, Fx 28 run twice will produce different test results
[2014-10-07 07:32:36] whitby_: There are a lot of variables* obviously, but is there a recommended debugging approach?
[2014-10-07 07:32:44] tony2, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2014-10-07 07:33:30] whitby_: * I'm running tests through Jenkins CI, MSBuild, sometimes through both, and sometimes through MSBuild and Visual Studio.
[2014-10-07 07:33:45] whitby_: On two different boxes as well.
[2014-10-07 07:34:36] whitby_: Or should I look into getting VMs setup and creating a common image through which tests are run?
[2014-10-07 07:34:51] jimevans: whitby_: you've got an awful lot of moving parts there.
[2014-10-07 07:35:02] *whitby_ sighs'
[2014-10-07 07:35:05] whitby_: Yeah...
[2014-10-07 07:35:12] whitby_: It's a bit of a mess.
[2014-10-07 07:35:33] ddary, quitting. (Quit: ddary)
[2014-10-07 07:35:36] jimevans: in general, when i have two different environments giving me two different results, my debugging advice is isolate the differences.
[2014-10-07 07:36:53] dimacus: why would BASE64Decoder in java return jiberish to me, when i put the same string into online base64 decoders it comes out just fine
[2014-10-07 07:37:08] jimevans: dimacus: because it doesn't like you.
[2014-10-07 07:37:17] dimacus: yeahthat's what it feels like :(
[2014-10-07 07:37:20] whitby_: jimevans: The odd part: they are both the same OS (Win 7) and (aside from the various installed software) the only difference that stands out to me is that Visual Studio is installed on one and not the other.
[2014-10-07 07:37:35] jimevans: dimacus: *i*, on the other hand, like you just fine, and would help if i could. :)
[2014-10-07 07:37:43] dimacus: lol

[2014-10-07 07:39:09] jimevans: whitby_: but you've mentioned different execution environments (jenkins, msbuild, visual studio). remember that OS is hardly the only environment.
[2014-10-07 07:40:06] jimevans: not to mention coypu, which i've no experience whatsoever with.

[2014-10-07 07:41:32] jimevans: and, to be fair, it's probably not the cause of the variance, but i can't say that for certain
[2014-10-07 07:41:49] whitby_: Fair points.
[2014-10-07 07:42:23] jimevans: it's probably not the .net bindings itself that would be the problem
[2014-10-07 07:42:32] WhereIsMySpoon: dimacus:you mean this http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Base64.Decoder.html ?

[2014-10-07 07:42:53] dimacus: writing a junit test to show it
[2014-10-07 07:43:15] whitby_: jimevans: The way I'm looking at it (which is probably wrong) is that Jenkins, MSBuild, etc. are all just kicking off a process and that that process should behave the same in all cases?
[2014-10-07 07:43:18] jimevans: i mean, i'm the last one to claim they're free of issues, but the likelihood of different behavior solely in the .net code is exceedingly small
[2014-10-07 07:43:28] jimevans: maybe, maybe not.
[2014-10-07 07:44:14] jimevans: is jenkins logged in as the same user running in the msbuild environment? i'd suspect probably not.
[2014-10-07 07:44:45] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 824
[2014-10-07 07:44:57] whitby_: It wasn't, and run into a whole different set of issues due to that :) but I've since fixed that
[2014-10-07 07:44:59] jimevans: because jenkins likes to set itself up as a windows service by default, which can cause all manner of weirdness in certain drivers.

[2014-10-07 07:47:38] whitby_: I guess to narrow in on a question: what is the recommended way of testing an app in various browsers on one OS? Virtual Machines? Installing the browsers on a machine and running the drivers? I've not looked into Grid, is that a more robust setup?
[2014-10-07 07:47:58] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont need grid for that
[2014-10-07 07:48:16] WhereIsMySpoon: just download the drivers for each browser you want to test and launch the tests for each one
[2014-10-07 07:48:25] WhereIsMySpoon: make which driver you use in your test configurable
[2014-10-07 07:49:49] dimacus: WhereIsMySpoon: so the one you gave does not seem to be available within the selenium project

[2014-10-07 07:52:06] whitby_: that's possible
[2014-10-07 07:52:14] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is fairly resilient to rubbish websites
[2014-10-07 07:52:16] jimevans: whitby_: if you have different results in the same execution environment, that points to an issue with the webdriver code, most likely timing.

[2014-10-07 07:53:32] WhereIsMySpoon: makes all driver.findElement calls wait for 30 seconds before timing out
[2014-10-07 07:53:38] jimevans: nonononononono. no no, a thousand times no.
[2014-10-07 07:53:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-10-07 07:53:57] jimevans: implicit waits are one feature i wish we'd never added.
[2014-10-07 07:54:05] WhereIsMySpoon: i find them insanely helpful
[2014-10-07 07:54:06] whitby_: uh oh
[2014-10-07 07:54:06] *whitby_ thinks I've started something'
[2014-10-07 07:54:15] jimevans: they obscure intent.
[2014-10-07 07:54:22] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: the tests I have would never work without some sort of wait
[2014-10-07 07:54:22] jimevans: and mask other issues.
[2014-10-07 07:54:30] WhereIsMySpoon: and explicit waits are a pain to write out
[2014-10-07 07:54:33] WhereIsMySpoon: fluent waits*
[2014-10-07 07:54:42] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: wrapper library with polling wait ("explicit waits)
[2014-10-07 07:54:52] WhereIsMySpoon: thats what implicit waits do O.o
[2014-10-07 07:54:59] jimevans: um, no, it's not.
[2014-10-07 07:55:21] jimevans: it has to do with where the wait is implemented.
[2014-10-07 07:55:30] jimevans: and again, obscures intent.
[2014-10-07 07:55:42] WhereIsMySpoon: if I do (new WebDriverWait(driver, 30)).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfELementLocated(By.id("blah")); that's no different
[2014-10-07 07:55:47] WhereIsMySpoon: in front of every findElement cal
[2014-10-07 07:55:48] WhereIsMySpoon: l
[2014-10-07 07:55:58] WhereIsMySpoon: this just saves you from writing that everywhere
[2014-10-07 07:56:10] jimevans: if i call findElement, but there's a chance i need to wait for the element to appear, i want that damned well expressed in my code, not obfuscated by the library
[2014-10-07 07:56:30] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, well in my case most of the web app under test has load times for stuff
[2014-10-07 07:56:44] WhereIsMySpoon: so i ended up writing waits everywhere
[2014-10-07 07:56:55] WhereIsMySpoon: so I removed them and just put that timeouts thing
[2014-10-07 07:57:17] WhereIsMySpoon: waiting a bit longer for something wont invalidate the test
[2014-10-07 07:57:24] jimevans: of course, if you're directly referencing the webdriver api in your tests, You're Doing It Wrong (TM)
[2014-10-07 07:57:27] WhereIsMySpoon: it'll make it more likely to pass
[2014-10-07 07:58:12] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: so you're saying that I -should- have an webdriverwait in front of every single findElement call?
[2014-10-07 07:58:22] WhereIsMySpoon: because thats what I ended up with
[2014-10-07 07:58:52] whitby_: Interesting...what are your thoughts on http://git.io/M7jPpQ then
[2014-10-07 07:58:55] jimevans: i'm saying you should wrap findElement with a helper method if that's what you're finding, and call the helper method instead of findElement directly.
[2014-10-07 07:59:11] WhereIsMySpoon: ?! how is that ANY different from setting implicitlyWait
[2014-10-07 07:59:40] dude-x: implicit wait is very dumb, and does one thing only
[2014-10-07 07:59:52] dude-x: using webdriver wait with any action is programmable, configurable
[2014-10-07 08:00:19] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: sure, but having to write it for almost every single findElement call is just copypasted code and annoying
[2014-10-07 08:00:24] jimevans: whitby_: that's fine. that's the contract the helper library explicitly states. i'd need to look at their implementation to provide any sort of comment about whether their approach is correct or not.
[2014-10-07 08:00:32] tony3, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-07 08:01:00] dude-x: i use a wrapper for the webdriver library so that any call to find element waits and handles noelement and staleelement exception
[2014-10-07 08:01:00] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-07 08:01:04] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: it *is* different, because the helper method is code *I* control, and can change at will. if you don't see the difference, you're either being deliberately obtuse, or just trolling me.
[2014-10-07 08:01:38] ato: So FirefoxDriver wraps all commands in window.setTimeout(func, 0).  Interesting.
[2014-10-07 08:01:58] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-07 08:02:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, so now the problem is that implicit waits in the webdriver api may be changed at any point? I was under the impression that the api behind exposed methods didn't get changed very often
[2014-10-07 08:02:29] ato: Comforting: // TODO(simon): This is rampantly ugly
[2014-10-07 08:02:41] dude-x: ato what's the effect of using timers like that
[2014-10-07 08:02:44] WhereIsMySpoon: "rampantly" - i like it :p
[2014-10-07 08:02:49] jimevans: the problem is, you don't control how the implicit waits are implemented, or even if they're implemented correctly.
[2014-10-07 08:03:06] WhereIsMySpoon: I thought webdriverwait was an implicit wait
[2014-10-07 08:03:10] WhereIsMySpoon: or am i getting confused
[2014-10-07 08:03:13] jimevans: no, absolutely not.
[2014-10-07 08:03:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-10-07 08:03:33] jimevans: implicit waits are usually implemented at the driver level, not in the language bindings.
[2014-10-07 08:03:37] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-10-07 08:03:50] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe this is where im getting confused
[2014-10-07 08:03:52] jimevans: and again, i believe that using them obscures intent.
[2014-10-07 08:04:01] ato: dude-x: JS single threaded so presumably it frees up the main thread to go on doing other things.  Think of it as submitting the callback function to the JS interpreter's scheduling.
[2014-10-07 08:04:08] ato: (Someone please correct me.)
[2014-10-07 08:04:15] dude-x: yeah that's what i thought
[2014-10-07 08:04:34] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: it's also the reason why mixing implicit and explicit waits is bad juju.
[2014-10-07 08:04:47] Guest52249, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2014-10-07 08:04:48] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: in that case, I guess it makes more sense to override WebElement and implement your own findElement method, but in this case, I think it makes more sense for the webdriver api to actually do this itself
[2014-10-07 08:05:07] WhereIsMySpoon: as in it makes sense for webdriver to explicitly wait for nosuchelement and stale exceptions and retry
[2014-10-07 08:05:23] dude-x: if you enable implicitwaits and then use an explicit wait with a find element call, you will get something that will wait 2x3 longer (say if you're timeout is 30 seconds) it may respond in 2 minutes
[2014-10-07 08:05:26] jimevans: no, it really doesn't.
[2014-10-07 08:05:34] WhereIsMySpoon: or at least for it to be configurable

[2014-10-07 08:06:36] Dave_B_: if my element is stale when i didn't expect it i want my tets to fail

[2014-10-07 08:07:04] dude-x: not to add wait methods
[2014-10-07 08:07:06] jimevans: Dave_B_: exactly, and you don't want to wait for the timeout for it to tell you it's stale either.
[2014-10-07 08:07:14] Dave_B_: yeah
[2014-10-07 08:07:24] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: i dislike boilerplate code
[2014-10-07 08:07:37] WhereIsMySpoon: im sure that these helper methods are probably something every webdriver dev has written
[2014-10-07 08:07:46] WhereIsMySpoon: once they understand waits
[2014-10-07 08:08:02] ato: whitby_: Yeah seemingly.
[2014-10-07 08:08:07] *whitby_ awkwardly interjects'
[2014-10-07 08:08:07] whitby_: jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks for the ideas though, I really need to take a deeper look into the setup here
[2014-10-07 08:08:32] jimevans: whitby_: nothing awkward about it.
[2014-10-07 08:08:33] jimevans: :)
[2014-10-07 08:09:03] dude-x: hmm i wonder if setImmediate would provide benefit in the FF driver; but probably not
[2014-10-07 08:09:04] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon and i go round-and-round about stuff from time to time.
[2014-10-07 08:09:13] jimevans: it's not personal.
[2014-10-07 08:09:21] WhereIsMySpoon: im not taking it personal :)
[2014-10-07 08:09:24] WhereIsMySpoon: im also not trolling
[2014-10-07 08:09:37] WhereIsMySpoon: i dislike boilerplate, it's tedious and frustrating
[2014-10-07 08:09:55] WhereIsMySpoon: it also prevents other people from onboarding to the technology
[2014-10-07 08:10:11] WhereIsMySpoon: "oh you can use this, but make sure to override the basic functions because they are not really usable with our app"
[2014-10-07 08:10:18] dude-x: my wrapper is pretty straight forward, and it provides common wait methods
[2014-10-07 08:10:21] WhereIsMySpoon: doesnt sound very appetising
[2014-10-07 08:10:34] dude-x: yeah it sucks you have to figure out how to wait properly
[2014-10-07 08:10:47] dude-x: but until someone builds in automation in a browser in a sensible way, this is what we have.
[2014-10-07 08:10:59] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: if that's the way it's presented, then i'm not surprised it's not appetizing.
[2014-10-07 08:11:45] Dave_B_: wait for what tho dude-x. Especially with things like websockets we never generically can tell if stuff is finished loading.
[2014-10-07 08:11:57] Dave_B_: hence i like explicit
[2014-10-07 08:12:02] Dave_B_: i know what i need for my test
[2014-10-07 08:12:06] Dave_B_: or model
[2014-10-07 08:12:09] Dave_B_: or whatever
[2014-10-07 08:12:38] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: unfortunately not everyone has web apps that are as straightforward as "this will ALWAYS behave in -exactly- this way", sometimes stuff loads quick, sometimes not
[2014-10-07 08:12:48] jimevans: if, rather, it's properly explained *why* things are that way (that the automation runs fast, the browser may be slow, and thus you have to wait for the browser to catch up), it might be easier to swallow.
[2014-10-07 08:12:53] WhereIsMySpoon: sometimes elements cause stale exceptions because they are reloaded, sometimes not
[2014-10-07 08:12:59] dude-x: Dave_B_: in that case, that's fine, but I am talking about this situation: wait for the button to appear. Oh noes! DOM is mutating too much, I don't see the button!. Okay wait on this element here first, then wait for the button to appear.
[2014-10-07 08:13:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: I know this is an issue with teh web app itself, but it's still necessary to test the app with automation
[2014-10-07 08:13:41] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont have these issues with another web app we have :D
[2014-10-07 08:14:10] dude-x: That aspect of writing webdriver tests can make some apps difficult to automate for beginners
[2014-10-07 08:14:39] jimevans: and, y'know, the answer to all of these complaints is to write a reusable wrapper library for webdriver that acts the way *you* think it should. and open-source it.
[2014-10-07 08:14:44] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 824
[2014-10-07 08:15:10] ato: :note simonstewart https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/262
[2014-10-07 08:15:11] selbot2_: ok!
[2014-10-07 08:15:14] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd love to open source the stuff I've written, unfortunately I doubt I'd get permission to
[2014-10-07 08:15:30] jimevans: (or use one of the dozens already out there in many different languages, but not-invented-here syndrome isn't limited to the nodeJS and php crowds)
[2014-10-07 08:16:06] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: or *don't* open source it. just create the wrapper library you need for the projects you work on internally.
[2014-10-07 08:16:17] WhereIsMySpoon: I have done that :)
[2014-10-07 08:16:54] WhereIsMySpoon: I guess it's just the difference between knowing this to start with and knowing it now and having to refactor
[2014-10-07 08:16:54] jimevans: then it should be ridiculously easy to use so-called explicit waits instead of implicit waits. :)
[2014-10-07 08:16:55] dude-x: i'd like to add figuring out where to synchronze something is also something tedious for me to do
[2014-10-07 08:17:16] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: maybe it's just a case of better promoted user education on waits
[2014-10-07 08:17:35] WhereIsMySpoon: I personally found the whole wait stuff quite difficult to understand the first time around
[2014-10-07 08:17:47] Dave_B_: generally if it's too hard to tell if a page is still loading i'll be pushing back on it anyway as it'll not be clear to users
[2014-10-07 08:17:54] jimevans: part of the problem is that it's nigh unto impossible to create a 100% effective, one-size-fits-all approach for a library as widely used for as many different projects and purposes as webdriver.
[2014-10-07 08:17:59] Dave_B_: unless it's a deliberately dynamic page
[2014-10-07 08:18:06] Dave_B_: in which case it needs clear rules
[2014-10-07 08:18:24] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: Im glad that you're able to make such big decisions by yourself :p
[2014-10-07 08:18:35] WhereIsMySpoon: thats serious btw
[2014-10-07 08:18:40] Dave_B_: yeah my objections are not always respected of course :p
[2014-10-07 08:19:01] jimevans: "when is my page completely loaded?" is a meaningless question in today's javascript-driven, dynamic-content web
[2014-10-07 08:19:18] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: sure, thats not something im trying to solve
[2014-10-07 08:19:35] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: didn't say it was. :)
[2014-10-07 08:19:42] jimevans: i was being tangential.
[2014-10-07 08:19:44] WhereIsMySpoon: ok :)
[2014-10-07 08:20:43] *jimevans is a bit grumpy because he has an insane amount of work to get done in the next 3 weeks'
[2014-10-07 08:20:58] WhereIsMySpoon: waits and the page object model are two things I really wish I'd understood a lot better before writing all my tests
[2014-10-07 08:21:12] WhereIsMySpoon: 2/3 of the time ive used on the tests have been refactoring
[2014-10-07 08:21:44] WhereIsMySpoon: its the sort of thing I'd probably write a blog about, if I had a blog or website
[2014-10-07 08:22:07] ato: The FirefoxDriver is really quite cleverly written.
[2014-10-07 08:22:09] jimevans: blogs are cheep.
[2014-10-07 08:22:13] jimevans: cheap even.

[2014-10-07 08:22:45] WhereIsMySpoon: why write it if nobody sees it
[2014-10-07 08:22:59] jimevans: because it's easier to do 1:many support that way.
[2014-10-07 08:23:16] WhereIsMySpoon: eh?

[2014-10-07 08:24:46] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: instead of typing out the whole rationale for "why do you need protected mode settings for IE" every time someone asks, or "why don't we do http response codes", i can just reply with a URL instead of the long-form 6-paragraph answer to each one.
[2014-10-07 08:24:54] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: yea, I get you
[2014-10-07 08:25:22] jimevans: it's the writing equivalent of a helper method. :)
[2014-10-07 08:25:33] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I really feel that a lot of time has been wasted, personally, by me not really understanding what the particular exceptions and waits mean, and not even seeing hte page object model until too late, meaning I had a lot of refactoring

[2014-10-07 08:29:17] jimevans: slinging, even.

[2014-10-07 08:30:37] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I think that currently, there is an absolute ton of documentation, that is probably all useful as a reference guide, but as a tutorial would be rather gruelling to go through

[2014-10-07 08:31:34] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: please create one :)
[2014-10-07 08:31:34] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: this is where i defer to tourdedave__ and dimacus, both of whom have books that touch on exactly those subjects. :)

[2014-10-07 08:35:29] ism: jimevans: damn, okay... Do most people in the industry just use one browser at a time or what?
[2014-10-07 08:35:50] WhereIsMySpoon: it depends on what resources you have
[2014-10-07 08:35:58] jimevans: yep, what he said.
[2014-10-07 08:36:10] WhereIsMySpoon: if you have 4 node VMs/pcs, then you can set up a node on each and do testing for each browser separately on each one
[2014-10-07 08:36:32] WhereIsMySpoon: with grid
[2014-10-07 08:36:41] ism: yeah, we're just doing it on one vm
[2014-10-07 08:36:48] WhereIsMySpoon: you can specify the capabiltiies of a node when its started
[2014-10-07 08:36:55] jimevans: it's often useful to have test results segregated by browser type, and use a CI system to farm out execution to different machines
[2014-10-07 08:37:44] WhereIsMySpoon: ism: what you can do is with some sort of builder like gradle, is pass a system variable in, say browserToUse, and switch on that variable in your test setup
[2014-10-07 08:37:48] WhereIsMySpoon: if you only have 1 node
[2014-10-07 08:37:58] WhereIsMySpoon: and then just execute 3 gradle builds

[2014-10-07 10:19:13] ato: And Presto-Opera.
[2014-10-07 10:19:23] jimevans: and even if the driver does, the .net language bindings don't let you get at the logs.
[2014-10-07 10:19:24] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-07 10:19:30] whitby_: jimevans: ah
[2014-10-07 10:19:33] ato: You need to distinguish between the client API and the driver SPI.
[2014-10-07 10:19:53] jimevans: neither is attractive.
[2014-10-07 10:19:55] jimevans: :)
[2014-10-07 10:19:56] ato: Even if it's in Firefox or Chrome, doesn't mean the client bindings you use know how to get it.
[2014-10-07 10:20:12] ato: But the information is still there.

[2014-10-07 10:26:27] whitby_: ato: ignorant question: are the client and drivers both part of Selenium?
[2014-10-07 10:26:44] ato: whitby_: In some cases yes, but not always.
[2014-10-07 10:26:53] jimevans: kinda sorta.

[2014-10-07 10:27:12] ato: IEDriver and FirefoxDriver is maintained by Selenium.
[2014-10-07 10:27:17] jimevans: (for now)
[2014-10-07 10:27:18] whitby_: (I guess it depends on the browser.)

[2014-10-07 10:29:00] ato: In some time both IE and Firefox will be supported by their respective browser vendors.
[2014-10-07 10:29:14] whitby_: Interesting
[2014-10-07 10:29:27] ato: This aligns with this process: http://www.w3.org/testing/browser/

[2014-10-07 13:44:14] dude-x: ooh
[2014-10-07 13:44:19] dimacus: is is bc the font that is chosen inside the IDE is slightly different than font chosen in mvn CLI

[2014-10-07 13:46:25] dimacus: ahh

[2014-10-07 14:07:22] dude-x: nevr thought about changing what's expected
[2014-10-07 14:08:24] dude-x: although when I have seen how other projects that use image comparison tests work, they have separate folders for platform A, platform B, so they run those tests as a test against that platform
[2014-10-07 14:08:36] dimacus: yeah that makes sense
[2014-10-07 14:08:50] dimacus: bc even setting a font by hand to 1 instead of having it derived does not help
[2014-10-07 14:09:27] dude-x: i think i saw a python project called needle that does fast image comparisons, and it can set a tolerance leel
[2014-10-07 14:09:34] dude-x: level so that 1 pixel shifts don't fail tests
[2014-10-07 14:09:46] dimacus: that's pretty cool idea
[2014-10-07 14:11:28] dude-x: so take a look at that, and see what image lib they use; i remember reading that it uses a nice algorithm that paints the differences so that some pixel shifting is colored based on magnitude of change. it will tolerate pixels shifted but won't tolerate say a radical color change (a single pixel turning blue to red)
[2014-10-07 14:11:52] dimacus: honestly, that's too much work for a simple test, i'm just gonna disable it when running outside of my machine
[2014-10-07 14:12:09] dimacus: bc trying to account for all installed fonts on every platform will kill me
[2014-10-07 14:12:22] dude-x: you have to standardize on something, usually the CI machine
[2014-10-07 14:12:28] dimacus: yeah
[2014-10-07 14:12:36] dimacus: maybe next week
[2014-10-07 14:12:47] dude-x: let QA or whoever nitpick real issues
[2014-10-07 14:12:51] dimacus: lol
[2014-10-07 14:12:54] dimacus: yeah
[2014-10-07 14:13:00] dude-x: which kind of sucks until you find a good image diff library
[2014-10-07 14:13:13] dude-x: FB wrote something called huxely which does image diff
[2014-10-07 14:13:16] dimacus: this is just adding tags to screenshots from selenium, this way screenshot has timestamp machine name etc
[2014-10-07 14:13:24] dude-x: i haven't really looked at it, ,but it's out there
[2014-10-07 14:13:26] dimacus: as long as the data is there, who cares about the font?
[2014-10-07 14:13:34] dude-x: ah
[2014-10-07 14:13:43] dimacus: work > benefit
