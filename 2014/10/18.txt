[2014-10-18 14:03:02] barancev: but findElements is different -- 104:{"from":"0","value":["{d335d473-1a4a-4352-9665-b6348a58fafe}","{76a4c5a3-53d7-4133-964c-9e860efb71b5}"]}
[2014-10-18 14:03:34] ato: Yeah?
[2014-10-18 14:03:59] barancev: sure
[2014-10-18 14:04:13] ato: Same selector?
[2014-10-18 14:04:42] ato: Guess I'm just missing the question (-:
[2014-10-18 14:05:02] barancev: the qestion is "why?" :)
[2014-10-18 14:05:18] ato: I'm not sure I understand.
[2014-10-18 14:05:23] ato: Is there just one element in the DOM?
[2014-10-18 14:05:36] ato: And findElement and findElements return different things?
[2014-10-18 14:06:10] barancev: why there is ELEMENT key? is it by the spec?
[2014-10-18 14:06:21] ato: Yes I think so.
[2014-10-18 14:06:27] ato: I'm not sure what the spec says about multiple elements.
[2014-10-18 14:07:03] ato: Whether it should just be a list of element references or a list of objects with element references [{"ELEMENT": …}, {"ELEMENT": …}].
[2014-10-18 14:07:26] barancev: or, why there is a map with ELEMENT key for elements returned by findElement and plain IDs in the result of findElements
[2014-10-18 14:07:52] barancev: yes, the representation of elements is not uniform
[2014-10-18 14:13:04] barancev: :spec

[2014-10-18 14:42:45] Rakko: Here was my question before: What API does it refer to when it says "Until now, keyboard interaction took place through a specific element… Since the new Interactions API takes a user-oriented approach,…"
[2014-10-18 14:44:45] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 797
[2014-10-18 14:45:02] ato: Web element's have a method to type keys into the element.  There's also an advanced user interaction API exposed through Actions (in Java).
[2014-10-18 14:45:16] ato: They are subtly different.
[2014-10-18 14:45:47] ato: Generally the latter gives you more control.  The first calls down to this, but with some more sanity checks.
[2014-10-18 14:46:37] Rakko: Where is the doc on the preceding?
[2014-10-18 14:47:54] ato: For Java, there's the JavaDoc on WebElement.
[2014-10-18 14:48:06] Rakko: OK, thanks
[2014-10-18 14:48:11] ato: Let me link both.
[2014-10-18 14:48:34] ato: There's sendKeys and click here: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html
[2014-10-18 14:48:56] ato: And this: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html
[2014-10-18 14:50:05] ato: The actions on WebElement are referred to as “do what I say” actions.  E.g. they will focus the element, scroll to it, make sure it's available in the DOM, make sure it's visible, etc. before performing the interaction.
[2014-10-18 14:50:44] ato: The advanced user interactions are more of a “do what I say” thing, where it will perform the actions you tell it to, regardless of whether an element is visible, interactible, etc.
[2014-10-18 14:51:10] ato: Sorry, the first are referred to as “do what I mean”.
