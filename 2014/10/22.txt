[2014-10-22 05:14:55] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-10-22 05:15:14] enhydra: WhereIsMySpoon, I was trying things like   driver.find_element_by_css_selector(".info_list.login_btn a").click()   or   driver.execute_script("document.getElementsByClassName('login_btn')[1].getElementsByTagName('a')[0].click();")
[2014-10-22 05:16:03] enhydra: so yes, the button clicked, but if it was the right button, this line didn’t return anything
[2014-10-22 05:16:28] WhereIsMySpoon: but why are you doing stuff like clicking buttons with execute_script
[2014-10-22 05:16:42] WhereIsMySpoon: Im not saying you cant use execute_script, but it should be a last resort
[2014-10-22 05:16:57] enhydra: well, .click() behaved the same way
[2014-10-22 05:16:59] WhereIsMySpoon: can you :gist the code that you currently have in your execute_script calls?

[2014-10-22 05:17:21] enhydra: just this, nothing else
[2014-10-22 05:17:22] WhereIsMySpoon: enhydra: oh sorry, you mean when you did .click() it also hanged?
[2014-10-22 05:17:25] enhydra: yes
[2014-10-22 05:17:40] WhereIsMySpoon: interesting
[2014-10-22 05:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: enhydra: and if you click the button with your mouse, does it hang?
[2014-10-22 05:19:24] enhydra: no, it doesn’t — it’s my current workaround
[2014-10-22 05:19:41] WhereIsMySpoon: enhydra: what about if you call .click() in the javascript console in the browser
[2014-10-22 05:19:52] enhydra: let me try
[2014-10-22 05:20:29] DarkRift, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2014-10-22 05:21:35] enhydra: by accessing the console, I get "disconnected: received Inspector.detached event"
[2014-10-22 05:21:40] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-10-22 05:21:54] WhereIsMySpoon: wait do you mean when you tried to open the console you got that?
[2014-10-22 05:21:58] enhydra: yes
[2014-10-22 05:22:00] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-10-22 05:22:04] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-10-22 05:22:19] sgsabbage: you can't open the console while selenium is running
[2014-10-22 05:22:28] WhereIsMySpoon: sure you can
[2014-10-22 05:22:40] sgsabbage: something to do with the way chromedriver accesses the same channel that the console uses, I thought?
[2014-10-22 05:22:44] WhereIsMySpoon: I've left browser windows open from selenium by not calling driver.quit and used them fine
[2014-10-22 05:22:49] sgsabbage: oh, yeah
[2014-10-22 05:22:55] sgsabbage: but if it's currently using that browser window
[2014-10-22 05:23:02] sgsabbage: as in, in the middle of running tests
[2014-10-22 05:23:04] WhereIsMySpoon: well yea if its running commands at that moment you cant
[2014-10-22 05:23:18] WhereIsMySpoon: enhydra: it isnt currently running stuff is it?
[2014-10-22 05:23:22] enhydra: it is
[2014-10-22 05:23:26] enhydra: how else do I click the button?
[2014-10-22 05:23:35] WhereIsMySpoon: ok maybe I wasnt clear enough
[2014-10-22 05:23:45] WhereIsMySpoon: open a web page with your website, not from selenium
[2014-10-22 05:23:51] WhereIsMySpoon: navigate to the same place
[2014-10-22 05:24:01] WhereIsMySpoon: and open the console and try to .click() the button with javascript from the console
[2014-10-22 05:24:23] WhereIsMySpoon: so press f12, go to the console and do document.findElementById("<myidhere>")
[2014-10-22 05:24:27] WhereIsMySpoon: or however you're identifying i
[2014-10-22 05:24:28] WhereIsMySpoon: t
[2014-10-22 05:24:39] enhydra: yes, that works fine
[2014-10-22 05:24:48] WhereIsMySpoon: you sure?
[2014-10-22 05:24:52] enhydra: yep, absolutely
[2014-10-22 05:24:53] WhereIsMySpoon: you tried it?
[2014-10-22 05:24:54] barancev: I bet you have a long loading page
[2014-10-22 05:25:02] enhydra: yes, right now
[2014-10-22 05:25:11] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: he's saying that doing .click() is making the driver hang
[2014-10-22 05:25:22] WhereIsMySpoon: when the click loads a new page
[2014-10-22 05:25:31] enhydra: actually, the button is being clicked with selenium, the problem is that I can’t do anything after that
[2014-10-22 05:25:32] barancev: that's why I think it is a long loading page
[2014-10-22 05:25:39] WhereIsMySpoon: why would that make any difference
[2014-10-22 05:26:40] barancev: selenium is trying to wait until a new page is loaded after click, and for some reason this event is not happening
[2014-10-22 05:26:54] barancev: (just a guess, though)
[2014-10-22 05:27:16] enhydra: it takes long to be loaded indeed, but it’s still done at some point
[2014-10-22 05:27:39] WhereIsMySpoon: for some value of "done" ;)
[2014-10-22 05:27:49] WhereIsMySpoon: but lets not go down that road of conversation
[2014-10-22 05:28:14] barancev: you think it is done, but selenium thinks it is not
[2014-10-22 05:28:45] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe you're overriding whatever selenium is looking for, not sure what it looks for though
[2014-10-22 05:28:55] barancev: what? git pull said that "fatal: unable to access 'https://barancev@code.google.com/p/selenium/': SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain"

[2014-10-22 05:32:17] Mixxit: rather than the one after the form submits
[2014-10-22 05:32:26] WhereIsMySpoon: Mixxit: I mean before you click enter
[2014-10-22 05:32:27] Mixxit: i added some sleeps in there also but that didn thelp
[2014-10-22 05:32:29] Mixxit: aye
[2014-10-22 05:32:43] WhereIsMySpoon: so when you use phantomjs, there is a button with value "Enter"

[2014-10-22 05:32:59] Mixxit: thats right and its in the pagesource and i dont get an elementnotfound exception when i send the click to it

[2014-10-22 05:36:12] WhereIsMySpoon: so you dont get the end-to-end testing that selenium is supposed to provide

[2014-10-22 05:36:58] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont need to have a proper screen to run selenium by the way, you can use a virtual desktop

[2014-10-22 05:41:10] p_l: Mixxit: in my case, I just ran one OS instance per test instance, under VMware, and thus benefitted from the fact that we had "console" display working to grab screenshots, have live view, etc.

[2014-10-22 05:42:01] WhereIsMySpoon: luckily I didnt do too many changes ^^
[2014-10-22 05:42:23] p_l: heh. In my case, phantomjs, or even firefox, were never an option, had to run tests under IE8...

[2014-10-22 06:43:57] simonstewart: Then I think that "getElementAttribute('value')" for an OPTION element should actually be returning the text content of the option
[2014-10-22 06:44:29] simonstewart: Which is obviously bollocks
[2014-10-22 06:44:45] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 797
[2014-10-22 06:45:14] simonstewart: If the value of an option element is what the text is if the value property is not set, then we're in good shape
[2014-10-22 06:46:01] simonstewart: Hurrah: The value attribute provides a value for element. The value of an option element is the value of the value content attribute, if there is one, or, if there is not, the value of the element's text IDL attribute.
[2014-10-22 06:47:16] simonstewart: Good. The 'text' property is defined as "Same as textContent, except that spaces are collapsed and script elements are skipped."
[2014-10-22 06:47:40] simonstewart: Which means I can take out the entire OPTION piece from that
[2014-10-22 06:48:06] ato: 👍
[2014-10-22 06:48:33] simonstewart: Now to remember which of "attribute" and "property" is always the fully qualified URL
[2014-10-22 06:48:39] simonstewart: I _think_ it's property
[2014-10-22 06:48:45] simonstewart: Who knows?

[2014-10-22 07:39:28] jimevans: what sent me down the rabbit hole was that i was running the webdriver tests against the implementation, and they'd get so far through the suite, then lock up.

[2014-10-22 07:40:06] jimevans: running the profiler showed that memory was being consumed up to the maximum available for an app on the platform.

[2014-10-22 07:44:26] jimevans: but if there *are* memory leaks in the injected atoms, our current tests aren't likely to catch them, because of the way we stop and restart the browser periodically within our tests.

[2014-10-22 09:34:43] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: so just refresh the QA db with prod data

[2014-10-22 09:35:07] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-22 09:35:17] dude-x: so it turns out, my coworker ran unit tests on a qa node, and it nuked the entire database (local to that node) and our shared cluster (which affects all qa nodes)
[2014-10-22 09:35:26] jimevans: you're assuming a centralized database. there are on-premises applications where you, the vendor of the software, don't keep and maintain the data your customers generate.
[2014-10-22 09:35:28] dude-x: a collection on our shared cluster

[2014-10-22 09:36:28] dude-x: So now I have to give up a Qa node until we do a data dump for the ruined QA node

[2014-10-22 09:37:16] WhereIsMySpoon: afaik
[2014-10-22 09:37:57] timg: also not sure how a test would accidentally drop an entire db
[2014-10-22 09:38:14] WhereIsMySpoon: timg: thats as easy as sending sql to the server
[2014-10-22 09:38:22] WhereIsMySpoon: drop database 'my_db'
[2014-10-22 09:38:39] timg: that doesn't sound accidental at all
[2014-10-22 09:39:08] WhereIsMySpoon: well, i doubt they sent -just- that
[2014-10-22 09:39:23] WhereIsMySpoon: but i mean in general you can do some stupid sql that manages to resolve to that
[2014-10-22 09:39:51] WhereIsMySpoon: just like if you do rm -rf and arent careful
[2014-10-22 09:40:10] dude-x: integration tests typically do a drop call

[2014-10-22 11:29:35] barancev: what's the actual problem?
[2014-10-22 11:30:45] barancev: 500 server errors in the log on DEBUG level is not the issue unless there is no external effect

[2014-10-22 11:35:19] quicksilver1183: all my consecutive requests keep getting timed out until I stop my test and restart it
[2014-10-22 11:35:55] quicksilver1183: based on my debugging and limited knowledge of how selenium works, it looks like the http server running on firefox stops responding for some reason
[2014-10-22 11:36:15] barancev: consecutive after what?
[2014-10-22 11:36:22] quicksilver1183: so here is what happens
[2014-10-22 11:37:00] quicksilver1183: my test is running just fine, and all of a sudden i start getting 500 read timeout errors
[2014-10-22 11:37:40] quicksilver1183: the http request to selenium standalone server start to get timed out
[2014-10-22 11:38:10] barancev: ah, I see, you call executeScript command
[2014-10-22 11:38:25] quicksilver1183: and this continues until I start a new browser [without even restarting selenium server]
[2014-10-22 11:38:42] barancev: check the browser console (Ctrl-Shift-J)
[2014-10-22 11:38:56] barancev: if there are error messages related to selenium
[2014-10-22 11:39:11] quicksilver1183: yeah i did checked that, no relevant information there
[2014-10-22 11:39:39] barancev: bad news...
[2014-10-22 11:40:08] quicksilver1183: The browser is there, but it looks like the http server running remotely via extension of firefox is the culprit here
[2014-10-22 11:40:41] barancev: is this a special page that causes the issue?
[2014-10-22 11:40:41] quicksilver1183: but i don't know how to debug it furtther, i tried sending some requests directly to remote server, and it looks like session is no longer there
[2014-10-22 11:40:53] quicksilver1183: no, this is very intermittent and inconsistent
[2014-10-22 11:41:19] barancev: can it be (intermittently) reproduced on a simple sample page?
[2014-10-22 11:41:43] quicksilver1183: i have been trying to reproduce it with simple pages, no luck till now.
[2014-10-22 11:41:53] barancev: bad news again...
[2014-10-22 11:42:20] quicksilver1183: is there some documentation of requests that remote server accepts?
[2014-10-22 11:43:54] barancev: what you expect to read from the documentation? it does not describe bugs. especially unknown ones :)
[2014-10-22 11:44:28] barancev: you can send the same requests selenium does, but you'll get the same 500 error

[2014-10-22 11:51:23] quicksilver1183: and also, i am under assumption that this is how selenium works: DRIVERS [perl or ruby or python]  ==> HTTP Requests[1] ==> Selenium Standalone ==> HTTP Requests [2] ==> Remote server
[2014-10-22 11:51:42] quicksilver1183: and that JsonWireProtocol is documentation for Http Requests [1]
[2014-10-22 11:51:48] jimevans: i have no insight whatsoever into what whatever perl language bindings you're using might work.
[2014-10-22 11:51:58] jimevans: your assumption is only partially correctl.
[2014-10-22 11:52:02] jimevans: correct*
[2014-10-22 11:52:05] lukeis: ruby / python can start up Firefox without the server and then communicate with it over http

[2014-10-22 11:52:59] lukeis: which is valid :)
[2014-10-22 11:53:07] quicksilver1183: and i really think this issue is independent of which client driver you are using
[2014-10-22 11:53:27] jimevans: it can also be language bindings [ruby or python or .NET or java] ==> http requests ==> browser-specific driver [IEDriverServer.exe or firefox browser extension or chromedriver executable]

[2014-10-22 12:08:34] mach6, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-22 12:09:01] barancev: dimacus: no, as far as I know
[2014-10-22 12:09:24] barancev: grid needs more care
[2014-10-22 12:09:37] barancev: wanna be a maintainer?
[2014-10-22 12:10:04] barancev: it is only one step from what you're doing already
[2014-10-22 12:10:07] dimacus: yeah might as well, been spending so much time on getting it to be more stable
[2014-10-22 12:11:13] dimacus: trying to fix a fun issue where safari proxy is in limbo post build but won't unregister even after i took the node offlline on the OS… feels like hub needs more control… to reach into the guts from time to time and hot fix these things

[2014-10-22 12:12:34] dimacus: part of the reason i wanted to have a simple RESTful api to be able to modify things via admin page
[2014-10-22 12:14:25] barancev: what about JMX? are you going to implement it too?

[2014-10-22 12:15:07] dimacus: actually i'm working with one co-worker to do so already :)
[2014-10-22 12:15:15] dimacus: he says that it should not be too dificult
[2014-10-22 12:15:17] barancev: cool
[2014-10-22 12:15:29] dimacus: but he got pulled away to fix a jenkins plugin he is working on
[2014-10-22 12:15:39] barancev: the difficult part is to define the set of mbeans

[2014-10-22 12:18:31] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-22 12:18:34] dimacus: if we put the Hub's registry int a DB instead of keeping it in memory, not only we would have access to the info
[2014-10-22 12:18:44] dimacus: but we can have a more persistent state
[2014-10-22 12:19:18] dimacus: at the same time, we could spin up multiple instances of hub, so we could do a hot swap of the jars with HA_Proxy or something else
[2014-10-22 12:19:32] barancev: imho DB is overhead
[2014-10-22 12:20:05] barancev: JMX is kind of in-memory DB for tthis special purpose -- monitoring and mamaging
[2014-10-22 12:20:21] dimacus: that's a valid point
[2014-10-22 12:21:29] dimacus: but here is the thing, once the hub is restarted… does JMX history persist?
[2014-10-22 12:21:47] barancev: do we need history?
[2014-10-22 12:22:49] dimacus: yeah actually… trying to track down bugs where the nodes/hub go into the weeds is very dificult since i'm not sure what happened right before the proxy exploded… to be fair.. more logging would probably solve that problem also
[2014-10-22 12:23:36] barancev: yes, I'd prefer plain logs
[2014-10-22 12:24:38] barancev: because DB can be not available from some nodes and the history can be lost
[2014-10-22 12:24:49] dimacus: ok, i'm gonna put a PR that has a ton more debug logs in the hub and registry

[2014-10-22 13:05:38] dimacus: if for any reason the after session fails, the release thread just exits, without actually releasing the internal key in the registry. So the key is there, and the proxy is "occupied" but it's not

[2014-10-22 13:07:36] dimacus: can you think of any reason it should not attempt to clean up the session key from the registry at that point? as in why return there and not allow it to go a little further and call release(internalKey, reason);
[2014-10-22 13:08:44] barancev: this question is too hard for me because it's midnight here now :)

[2014-10-22 17:47:29] Mixologic: any ideas what would cause selenium standalone jar to start, but *not* listen on port 4444? its not showing *any* errors, it just never opens the socket, but intermittently.
