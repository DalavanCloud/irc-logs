[2014-10-06 08:39:01] scones: I'm having a problem where selenium closes the browser it opens before the browser has had a chance to fully render the site.  I've read through the explicit and implicit waits section, but both of those rely on waiting for a certain object to appear on the page.  However, the javascript is such that I can't wait for one object because there's no guarentee of the order of which the object will appear.
[2014-10-06 08:39:16] scones: Is there a way to tell selenium to just wait for 6 seconds or something?
[2014-10-06 08:39:45] dimacus: scones: yes
[2014-10-06 08:39:55] dimacus: what language are you using?
[2014-10-06 08:40:48] scones: dimacus: Java, at the moment.
[2014-10-06 08:41:08] dimacus: ok just do Thread.sleep(6000); in between the calls
[2014-10-06 08:41:23] dimacus: however, do you have jQuery on the site? or any other JS library?
[2014-10-06 08:41:47] scones: dimacus: The site is quite the mess of javascript. Dojo, I believe is the framework?
[2014-10-06 08:42:03] dimacus: gotcha, here is a better solution
[2014-10-06 08:42:53] *dimacus looks to find code example'
[2014-10-06 08:43:01] scones:   :)
[2014-10-06 08:43:13] lukeis: finally paid for TPAC :) glad they have auto-reminders
[2014-10-06 08:43:21] scones: My Java has fallen behind as of late. This whole predicates thing is new to me.
[2014-10-06 08:44:21] dimacus: scones: so this is a rough example i did for "Wait for Ajax" and Wait for animations to finish after each page load
[2014-10-06 08:44:45] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 821
[2014-10-06 08:44:47] dimacus: this way the test asks the JS if there is anything happening in background, when current ajax calls are set to 0 then the test goes on
[2014-10-06 08:44:53] dimacus: scones: https://github.com/dimacus/SeleniumBestPracticesBook/blob/master/Java/src/test/java/chapter5/helpers/SeleniumWrapper.java#L121-L163
[2014-10-06 08:45:18] dimacus: scones: i belive with dojo you will just replace the jQuery.active with something like this dojo.io.XMLHTTPTransport.inFlight.length
[2014-10-06 08:45:55] dimacus: scones: sleeps are evilâ€¦ everytime you use a sleep, you kill a kitten in Australia
[2014-10-06 08:46:01] scones: dimacus: Ok!  Neat!  There's a bit their to digest, but I appreciate you pointing me in the right direction.
[2014-10-06 08:46:35] scones: dimacus: If you wouldn't mind enlightening a noob, why are sleeps evil?  Just that the slow down the tests?
[2014-10-06 08:46:48] dimacus: yeah that's one part
[2014-10-06 08:47:12] lukeis: because your app may take less than X time to processâ€¦ and so if it's Y time  X-Y time is wasted
[2014-10-06 08:47:42] lukeis: and when you have hundreds or thousands of tests running and they all have 'little' sleeps in there, it slows the whole thing down by hours
[2014-10-06 08:48:26] dimacus: also, if your app is under a lot of stress, like 2x more users are testing against it, then a 6 second sleep might not be enough, so your tests are failing for no good reason
[2014-10-06 08:51:10] scones: That makes sense.  Didn't know if there was something else in there besides what I came up with at first blush.

[2014-10-06 08:52:34] dimacus: :)
[2014-10-06 08:52:41] antsanto: Is it possible to get the locator from the given webelement?
[2014-10-06 08:52:51] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: no
[2014-10-06 08:53:31] WhereIsMySpoon: if by that you mean extract a By from a WebElement
[2014-10-06 08:53:36] smccarthy: antsanto: there is no 1:1 relationship between a locator and a webelement. Since you can find a web elemnt a million different ways
[2014-10-06 08:53:45] antsanto: I can see RemoteWebElement has method called setFoundBy, which does store this information. but sadly no getter calls for that!!
[2014-10-06 08:53:53] antsanto: WhereIsMySpoon Yes
[2014-10-06 08:53:55] dimacus: scones: also, i'd recommend you wrap every click and type with wait for ajax methods, this way if you have a text field with auto field, the test will automatically wait for the auto fill to finish before moving on, this will save you headaches like that
[2014-10-06 08:54:14] WhereIsMySpoon: dimacus: or you can just do driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait
[2014-10-06 08:54:17] jimevans: antsanto: you found the element, you should already *have* the locator. :)
[2014-10-06 08:54:17] farlan, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-10-06 08:55:13] antsanto: jimevans Yes true. But down the line if web element is passed to other methods, where we get stale exception, it become handy to query the dom again
[2014-10-06 08:55:44] dimacus: antsanto: in that case why not just pass the By object you created in first place?
[2014-10-06 08:56:01] jimevans: dimacus: caching.
[2014-10-06 08:56:10] dimacus: ?
[2014-10-06 08:56:18] antsanto: But why does RemoteWebElement class doesn't provide getter for foundBy , which has this information.
[2014-10-06 08:56:21] jimevans: you save the overhead of the findElement call.
[2014-10-06 08:56:22] dimacus: jimevans: please educate me more
[2014-10-06 08:56:40] jimevans: if you only pass the locator, you have to call findElement every time you want to actually get the element.
[2014-10-06 08:56:53] dimacus: ahh makes sense
[2014-10-06 08:57:18] selenium33, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-06 08:57:21] selenium33, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-10-06 08:57:23] antsanto: jimevans True. Actually thats the better way to escape from stale as well!
[2014-10-06 08:57:25] jimevans: that makes sure your element is fresh, but it's a (relatively significant) perf het
[2014-10-06 08:57:36] jimevans: s/het/hit
[2014-10-06 08:58:24] antsanto: jimevans so my basic question is, even though remote web element class has foundBy information, why does authors decide it shouldn't be accessible?
[2014-10-06 08:58:53] jimevans: simonstewart: wanna take a crack? ^^
[2014-10-06 08:59:10] antsanto: its just matter of get* method. And it opens many door to solve problems
[2014-10-06 08:59:27] antsanto: probably let me send a PR tomorrow regarding this :)
[2014-10-06 08:59:27] jimevans: (incidentally, antsanto, you're talking about a java implementation detail. other language bindings have no setter at all)
[2014-10-06 08:59:48] antsanto: jimevans oh!!! This i never thought of!
[2014-10-06 09:00:40] jimevans: when you're thinking about API changes, you have to remember that it needs to be implementable in all 5 supported languages.
[2014-10-06 09:01:07] barancev: antsanto: think about elements returned by findElements method -- what locator should we set for them?
[2014-10-06 09:02:06] barancev: escaping from stale is not always as simple as "search again using the same locator"
[2014-10-06 09:02:19] WhereIsMySpoon: usually it is though
[2014-10-06 09:02:20] simonstewart: antsanto: because the information isn't always there, and it's internal state to the Object.
[2014-10-06 09:02:22] jimevans: also, how do you serialize the locator from the remote java server? there's no protocol for serialization of that information across the wire.
[2014-10-06 09:03:07] simonstewart: I've got this on loop today. Need some proper angry music to keep me focused: http://open.spotify.com/track/0YUoakGfRKsi6baNMSuVOO

[2014-10-06 12:36:11] dimacus: well if you have a wait, you probably will have a sleep inside the loop right?
[2014-10-06 12:36:19] dimacus: why not throw a screenshot in there?

[2014-10-06 12:58:36] AutomatedTester: dimacus: by proxy do you mean grid nodes or proxy?
[2014-10-06 12:59:13] dimacus: well that's the tricky part, we need to clarify the word "node" and "proxy" bc node == proxy right now
[2014-10-06 12:59:20] dimacus: but some people say node == computer
[2014-10-06 12:59:29] dimacus: but a computer has multiple "nodes" so
[2014-10-06 12:59:43] dimacus: so node would be better than proxy
[2014-10-06 12:59:51] AutomatedTester: so overloading proxy seems like the least ideal name
[2014-10-06 12:59:57] dimacus: yeah

[2014-10-06 14:08:30] dimacus: yeah it's probably a maven config that got accidently bumped
[2014-10-06 14:08:45] dimacus: or possibly a 3rd party tool that bumped it up to 7

[2014-10-06 14:15:02] smccarthy: yea, the iframe in my page is http, but the page itself is https
[2014-10-06 14:15:15] smccarthy: so the content doesn't appear in the iframe , unless Mixed Content mode is set to Enabled
[2014-10-06 14:15:20] dimacus: i don't see a reason why we can't have a new end point to endable/disable mixed content
[2014-10-06 14:15:39] dimacus: i do belive it's a simple regex entry, just need to add a new Task that allows you to toggle it on and off
[2014-10-06 14:15:53] smccarthy: ok, I can make a PR for that. I just wasn't sure if you wanted it, because most people wont use it lol
[2014-10-06 14:16:41] dimacus: if it's needed then why not add it
[2014-10-06 14:16:52] dimacus: btw almost done with your previous PR, just need to merge a couple of conflicts
