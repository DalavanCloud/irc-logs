[2014-10-03 03:34:31] simonstewart: Going to see if I can build selenium on Windows using Buck
[2014-10-03 03:34:43] simonstewart: If we can, I’m going to try and kill CrazyFun

[2014-10-03 03:39:02] simonstewart: And the company goal (“make the world more open and connected”) is a good one.
[2014-10-03 03:39:15] simonstewart: Clone finished. That was shockingly fast
[2014-10-03 03:39:46] antsanto: by anychance fb uses selenium for UI testing?
[2014-10-03 03:39:54] antsanto: ;)
[2014-10-03 03:41:28] simonstewart: Yes they do
[2014-10-03 03:41:35] simonstewart: selendroid and ios-driver too
[2014-10-03 03:41:48] simonstewart: We wrote PHP and ObjC bindings for the wire protocol
[2014-10-03 03:41:57] antsanto: Thats cool simonstewart

[2014-10-03 07:01:34] sorinello: WhereIsMySpoon, No, they are large dynamic tables

[2014-10-03 07:03:05] WhereIsMySpoon: or am I wrong?
[2014-10-03 07:03:11] simonstewart: OK. So Buck can build the firefox driver on Windows
[2014-10-03 07:03:23] simonstewart: Well, the fork on my Windows laptop can
[2014-10-03 07:03:27] simonstewart: But it doesn’t run tests
[2014-10-03 07:03:31] simonstewart: I may go postal
[2014-10-03 07:03:36] sorinello: WhereIsMySpoon, : Yes, I agree. But there is a table which I have to test. And when I say table, I don't mean <tr> and <td> I mean a table like view, which can change form, new dropdowns appear, etc
[2014-10-03 07:04:06] sorinello: new buttons, etc. so it's not per se a traditional HTML table
[2014-10-03 07:04:08] WhereIsMySpoon: sorinello: and I guess you need to test each dropdown that it has the correct info etc
[2014-10-03 07:04:27] WhereIsMySpoon: and test the form as a whole to make sure when u enter some info i tcomes with the correct output
[2014-10-03 07:04:28] sorinello: yes, I am writing some end to end tests, and I get quite deep using that table
[2014-10-03 07:04:38] WhereIsMySpoon: then you need to just create the tests in that way
[2014-10-03 07:04:39] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry
[2014-10-03 07:05:00] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is an end-to-end testing framework, it's supposed to mirror what a user does
[2014-10-03 07:05:45] WhereIsMySpoon: it will by necessity be explicit and sometimes have long tests

[2014-10-03 08:48:58] WhereIsMySpoon: joshin4colours: that seems rather pointless
[2014-10-03 08:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: most of the time a selenium test dictates a workflow, you cant unit test part of a workflow
[2014-10-03 08:49:34] dude-x: joshin4colours: what might make sense is that you reverse the condition of your asserts to make sure your tests failed
[2014-10-03 08:49:51] dude-x: you want to make sure your working tests do actually work when stuff go bads

[2014-10-03 08:52:41] WhereIsMySpoon: you can't fill out form x without first going to page y and pressing button z which opens up form x
[2014-10-03 08:52:56] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore unit testing is impossible usually

[2014-10-03 08:56:19] joshin4colours: and plus, if your tests are *so* complicated that you could have unit tests, your tests are probably bad
[2014-10-03 08:56:35] Dave_B_: having a process to prove that the test will fail is nice tho - it tends to be something I demo when trying to get tests through code review

[2014-10-03 09:07:43] dimacus: i'm intrigued
[2014-10-03 09:07:48] dimacus: do explain more
[2014-10-03 09:08:12] smccarthy: There is already a feature to reboot the VM/machine after X amount of test runs, right?
[2014-10-03 09:08:22] dimacus: yup
[2014-10-03 09:08:38] smccarthy: So put that Test Runs # on the Overview page. So you can see if there were 100 test runs, or only 5, etc
[2014-10-03 09:09:03] dimacus: yeah already on it :)
[2014-10-03 09:09:09] smccarthy: haha k!
[2014-10-03 09:09:45] dimacus: that's what the left side of the page is for

[2014-10-03 09:16:38] dimacus: oh just serve back some html code rendered from java args
[2014-10-03 09:17:06] dimacus: currently i just build the DIVs with string.append and return a string that the server returns to the browser to render
[2014-10-03 09:18:02] lukeis: dimacus: it's called jsp :)
[2014-10-03 09:18:07] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, so use a html template with something that can interact with java attributes, like freemarker
[2014-10-03 09:18:24] dimacus: yeah i'll come around to that
[2014-10-03 09:18:40] dimacus: don't have time to learn a new tool but i think i want to do that next
[2014-10-03 09:18:54] dimacus: (refactor into freemarker or something later)

[2014-10-03 09:21:24] dimacus: well at the moment i only had to do 1 div with some ULs, so i did it with just string append but yeah, i think i need to upgrade to a templating system when i do something more complex

[2014-10-03 12:12:13] AutomatedTester: ato: well... the thing with putting like he suggested is that it lives in the Se tree
[2014-10-03 12:12:22] AutomatedTester: I thought we were against vendors giving us code
[2014-10-03 12:12:33] ato: That's an excellent point too.
[2014-10-03 12:12:57] AutomatedTester: I think us telling vendors that their code isnt welcome is silly btw
[2014-10-03 12:13:18] AutomatedTester: and is part of my "making people download a million things just to run tests" rant
[2014-10-03 12:13:30] ato: Java is a special snowflake in this context.
[2014-10-03 12:13:41] AutomatedTester: why?
[2014-10-03 12:13:44] SamuraiJack_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[2014-10-03 12:14:28] ato: Because it doesn't really have the concept of “one download”.  People usually use monstrosities like Maven if they work directly with the Java API.
[2014-10-03 12:14:44] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 820
[2014-10-03 12:14:51] AutomatedTester: sure... but Maven would allow them to host it themselves
[2014-10-03 12:14:56] ato: Most people who download the .jars manually use a different language.
[2014-10-03 12:15:21] ato: And you think that's a good or bad thing?

[2014-10-03 12:16:01] AutomatedTester: I am in favour of vendors offering code to the project
[2014-10-03 12:16:35] ato: Download = Maven artefact in this case?
[2014-10-03 12:16:43] AutomatedTester: yea
[2014-10-03 12:16:50] AutomatedTester: or manually downloading a jar

[2014-10-03 12:39:05] selbot2: 03barancev 3 months ago - Fixing platform comparison. Fixes issue 7522 | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=52197cf | http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/revision/52197cf5d134d921809642db71da75b655e71229
[2014-10-03 12:39:44] dimacus: for some reason in last couple of new versions, when i ask for capability.platform="VISTA" and the node is registered as "WINDOWS" i get no match
[2014-10-03 12:40:05] dimacus: as far as i can tell, this was the commit that changed it
[2014-10-03 12:40:11] barancev: because WINDOWS is not VISTA
[2014-10-03 12:40:25] dimacus: ah…
[2014-10-03 12:40:26] barancev: VISTA is WINDOWS, but not the opposite
[2014-10-03 12:40:34] dimacus: ohhhhh
[2014-10-03 12:40:40] dimacus: that makes sense!
[2014-10-03 12:41:02] dimacus: and so that commit turned that around?
[2014-10-03 12:41:36] dimacus: as in, fixed the issue where VISTA <=> Windows, not it's Vista <= Windows
[2014-10-03 12:41:51] barancev: this commit made matching more consistent
[2014-10-03 12:41:55] barancev: see the tests
[2014-10-03 12:42:05] dimacus: yeah i just wanted to confirm it :)
[2014-10-03 12:42:21] dimacus: thanks that helps a lot, me being silly i was still using "Windows" as default and that got me in trouble
[2014-10-03 12:44:03] barancev: if you requested VISTA it would be wrong to return any WINDOWS node, because you want VISTA
[2014-10-03 12:44:17] dimacus: yes sir that makes sense
[2014-10-03 12:44:31] dimacus: i guess "Windows" is a bit of a tricky "platfrom"
[2014-10-03 12:44:42] dimacus: s/tricky/loaded term/
[2014-10-03 12:44:44] AutomatedTester: as tricky as OSX

[2014-10-03 12:45:43] barancev: it is a "family"
[2014-10-03 12:46:31] dimacus: yeah it is, just the family tree can be very confusing, sort of like a family tree from Kentucky
[2014-10-03 12:46:33] barancev: each platform object belongs to a family
[2014-10-03 12:46:51] dimacus: barancev: thank you sir, i think i fully understand it now
[2014-10-03 12:47:10] dimacus: was stearing at the code for a while but it was not "clicking" for some silly reason :(
[2014-10-03 12:47:58] barancev: it would be nice to have system design documentation, but...
[2014-10-03 12:48:05] barancev: :)
[2014-10-03 12:48:18] dimacus: actually i'm about to update the capabilities wiki

[2014-10-03 13:00:51] dimacus: of corse he is asleep :-P
[2014-10-03 13:01:43] dimacus: but when it comes to the platform, we should just stick to the enums that are in Platform.java for now
[2014-10-03 13:03:07] dimacus: it's interesting that WIN8 and WIN8_1 are different platforms when VISTA and  7 are not, has there been that much of a difference between 8 and 8.1?

When the operation is successfull the page closes itself.  When the operation fails a new page is loaded in the window with an error message.  The process randomly fails(freezes) while checking if the window is still open.
