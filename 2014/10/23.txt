[2014-10-23 04:11:55] dimacus: :ask

[2014-10-23 04:11:57] vlado_: I have problem with jenkins setup for selenium webdriver
[2014-10-23 04:12:23] vlado_: I will bee very happy if someone can to help me
[2014-10-23 04:12:57] dimacus: vlado_: what's the question?
[2014-10-23 04:13:40] vlado_: How to setup jenkins to run webdriver.io and phantom.js
[2014-10-23 04:13:42] vlado_: ?

[2014-10-23 04:19:04] dimacus: vlado_: sorry friend, just need a more specific question, like window does not open, or how do i make this happen. setting up a jenkins job to run with phantom.js is a big question that might take days to accomplish
[2014-10-23 04:19:50] vlado_: If someone familiar with selenium and continous integration, will be awsome to chat with him?
[2014-10-23 04:22:08] vlado_: I cannot be specific, beacuse I start to reaserach how to setup jenkins and I have a lot a question for this theme.
[2014-10-23 04:22:28] dimacus: have you tried to google for some tutorials?
[2014-10-23 04:23:10] vlado_: yes, but I didn't found anything specific.
[2014-10-23 04:24:11] vlado_: I found only how to setup jenkins, but I didn't found how to integrate webdriver.js and phantom.js into jenkins
[2014-10-23 04:24:34] dimacus: technically there should not be "integration" with jenkins
[2014-10-23 04:24:50] dimacus: if yo can make your tests run on your computer you can make them run in jenkins
[2014-10-23 04:25:38] WhereIsMySpoon: vlado_: I assume what you have at the moment is your tests running locally yes?
[2014-10-23 04:25:46] vlado_: yes, on my compuet I use selenium web driver,node.js, phantom and mocha to run test
[2014-10-23 04:25:50] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-10-23 04:26:01] WhereIsMySpoon: so what you need is to setup the jenkins plugin for selenium webdriver
[2014-10-23 04:26:13] WhereIsMySpoon: which will then start up a hub
[2014-10-23 04:26:30] WhereIsMySpoon: you then need to start up a node on your pc and run the tests via a jenkins job
[2014-10-23 04:26:49] WhereIsMySpoon: if you arent using remotewebdriver, you will have to refactor a bit for your tests to use remotewebdriver
[2014-10-23 04:26:55] WhereIsMySpoon: instead of chromedriver/firefoxdriver/iedriver
[2014-10-23 04:27:13] WhereIsMySpoon: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp
[2014-10-23 04:27:18] WhereIsMySpoon: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[2014-10-23 04:27:41] vlado_: Can you recommend some kind of video or blog where I can see the steps
[2014-10-23 04:27:59] WhereIsMySpoon: nope
[2014-10-23 04:28:07] WhereIsMySpoon: not really
[2014-10-23 04:28:36] WhereIsMySpoon: follow those links
[2014-10-23 04:28:45] WhereIsMySpoon: its relatively simple to set up
[2014-10-23 04:28:50] vlado_: Ok, thank you for help

[2014-10-23 08:00:19] WhereIsMySpoon: aha
[2014-10-23 08:00:26] WhereIsMySpoon: people suck
[2014-10-23 08:01:04] yosito: WhereIsMySpoon: My app doesn't need to mock API responses, my tests do. I've got a Selenium test that fills out a form, submits it, and checks the result in the page. But I want it to get a response from a fake API, not the real one.
[2014-10-23 08:01:27] jimevans: meh, i've just learned to roll with most of it. and i keep track of people who say something so stupid or in a way so offensive i can't get past it, and resolve not to work with them.
[2014-10-23 08:01:56] WhereIsMySpoon: yosito: so this form submit goes to this api right?
[2014-10-23 08:02:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: fair enough
[2014-10-23 08:02:07] yosito: WhereIsMySpoon: Yes
[2014-10-23 08:02:40] *jimevans realizes he's probably on an incalculable number of similar lists kept by other folks in our industry'
[2014-10-23 08:03:13] WhereIsMySpoon: yosito: why do you want your test to not do the same thing as it would in production?
[2014-10-23 08:03:48] WhereIsMySpoon: obviously not with the prod db
[2014-10-23 08:04:14] yosito: WhereIsMySpoon: I do, but I can't run my test against the real API routes.
[2014-10-23 08:04:32] WhereIsMySpoon: ah, i guess you dont have a test/dev version of the real api routes

[2014-10-23 08:05:11] WhereIsMySpoon: can your app not detect when it's in dev mode and have the form submit just go to some dummy api
[2014-10-23 08:05:12] yosito: WhereIsMySpoon: No. That's why I'm looking at using something like Sinon's Fake Server or VCR.
[2014-10-23 08:05:35] yosito: WhereIsMySpoon: And I don't want to add test code into my app.
[2014-10-23 08:06:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-10-23 08:06:43] WhereIsMySpoon: well the only way to modify where the form sends to is to execute some javascript in your selenium

[2014-10-23 08:07:45] WhereIsMySpoon: yosito: the WebDriver class provides execute_script (or executeScript) method for js execution
[2014-10-23 08:08:40] jimevans: yosito: i'm coming in late to the conversation, but i'm not sure how your webdriver code would care, as long as your fake api serves up the proper html.
[2014-10-23 08:09:14] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: his app form submit points to the real api
[2014-10-23 08:09:29] WhereIsMySpoon: and he refuses to add code in his app to make it point towards the fake one
[2014-10-23 08:09:38] jimevans: sounds like proxy-and-redirect time.
[2014-10-23 08:09:53] WhereIsMySpoon: that would work too
[2014-10-23 08:10:11] WhereIsMySpoon: not that refusing to add test code into your app is a bad thing btw
[2014-10-23 08:10:21] WhereIsMySpoon: just realised that sounded accusative
[2014-10-23 08:10:25] jimevans: (and a poorly designed app that can't redirect to a different back end. IoC containers for the mother-lovin' win)
[2014-10-23 08:10:55] WhereIsMySpoon: yea this is more what i was getting at ^
[2014-10-23 08:11:09] WhereIsMySpoon: your app shouldnt care what back end its pointing at, it should grab that from some config

[2014-10-23 08:48:37] smccarthy: version of selenium-grid-extras
[2014-10-23 08:48:46] dimacus: yeah that sounds like a good idea
[2014-10-23 08:48:51] dimacus: very good idea
[2014-10-23 08:49:27] smccarthy: want me to make a feature branch for it, or did you ? Would we just put a String variable with the version in it and dispaly that variable ?
[2014-10-23 08:50:44] dimacus: go for it, i'm cleaning up how we make all the background commands to give more info in the error log… brain is a bit twisted

[2014-10-23 08:50:55] dimacus: thanks! :)
[2014-10-23 08:51:01] smccarthy: of course, np !
[2014-10-23 08:51:20] dimacus: hopefully in this build we will have more log info, that way when a hub does not start or node does not, the error is not swallowed up
[2014-10-23 08:53:08] smccarthy: oh sweet, good idea. I think the issue the other guy is/was having is that the first time config has to be ran, to create the hub json
[2014-10-23 08:54:03] smccarthy: Maybe there should be an option to run the first time config method after the first time ? like java -jar SeleniumGridExtras.jar -DrunFirstTimeConfig ?
[2014-10-23 08:54:14] dimacus: or better still
[2014-10-23 08:54:36] dimacus: if the node_.json or hub_.json does not exist, send them through the first time config path
[2014-10-23 08:54:41] dimacus: and just overwrite everything
[2014-10-23 08:54:45] dimacus: that might fix it

[2014-10-23 10:05:35] lukeis: hi jleyba: yosito had a question early about node js… how to (synchronously) return 'text' of an element (their gist): https://gist.github.com/josiahsprague/95360a812d4a975d3dfa
[2014-10-23 10:05:44] *lukeis would like to know what you think too :)'
[2014-10-23 10:06:03] jleyba: synchronous + js does not compute
[2014-10-23 10:06:13] lukeis: (kind of what i said...)
[2014-10-23 10:06:34] lukeis: didn't know if you had a utility for that or something, or just "do async programming like you're supposed to"
[2014-10-23 10:06:49] jleyba: do async programming like you're supposed to
[2014-10-23 10:07:14] lukeis: yosito: ok, so you should be passing in a callback function that will get the 'text' passed into it, rather than 'returning' the value
[2014-10-23 10:08:14] jleyba: if you're using node 0.11.3+ you can use generators, which makes things a little nicer

[2014-10-23 10:13:58] bbark123: I'm trying to run HTMLUNIT on selenium grid, and the results are different running on the grid vs locally. For example: a specific javascript triggered dropdown which populates another loads correctly locally, but isn't working on a node HTMLUNIT connected to a selenium grid. I've tried in several places to enable Javascript, and in the logs in the node it says javascript is enabled. Is there a good website on how to configure HTMLUNIT to work wit

[2014-10-23 10:20:53] jleyba: if you're going to introduce the overhead of a http connection, you really should just use phantomjs
[2014-10-23 10:21:02] jleyba: which at least uses a real rendering engine
[2014-10-23 10:21:45] mach6: but supposedly has corner case issue with find By, at least last I heard. do you know if they have been addressed?
[2014-10-23 10:21:51] mach6: issues*
[2014-10-23 10:21:56] yosito: lukeis: What does that look like?
[2014-10-23 10:22:22] bbark123: mach6: I've run into that corner case with phantomjs, in several places unfortunately
[2014-10-23 10:23:28] mach6: bbark123: do you have to run against something that is headless?
[2014-10-23 10:23:59] lukeis: yosito: can you start using what jleyb_ pointed out? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/example/google_search_generator.js
[2014-10-23 10:24:30] bbark123: no, but it is nice because of resources. Currently we have 7 dockerboxes hosting firefox nodes, but hardware is hard to come by
[2014-10-23 10:25:30] yosito: lukeis: I don't see a callback there, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.
[2014-10-23 10:25:54] lukeis: it's the yield thing
[2014-10-23 10:26:33] yosito: What is `yield` I've never seen that before.
[2014-10-23 10:26:34] bbark123: and they like memory. I have a grid of phantomjs nodes that takes at the most 80mb per dockerbox
[2014-10-23 10:26:37] yosito: ?
[2014-10-23 10:26:49] jleyba: yosito: new feature in es6 harmony
[2014-10-23 10:26:59] jleyba: (harmony == next version of javascript)
[2014-10-23 10:27:21] yosito: Hmm, is that already supported in node?
[2014-10-23 10:27:27] jleyba: node 0.11.x
[2014-10-23 10:27:34] jleyba: hidden behind a flag (--harmony)
[2014-10-23 10:27:54] yosito: Isn't there any way to do this without es6 harmony?
[2014-10-23 10:28:07] lukeis: callback chains? :)
[2014-10-23 10:28:30] yosito: What does a callback chain look like?
[2014-10-23 10:29:18] jleyba: yosito: spend some time looking at the tests that come with selenium-webdriver (in the test dir)
[2014-10-23 10:30:04] mach6: bbark123: i feel your pain. if I were in your shoes and more hardware wasn't an option and if i couldn't get htmlunit to work,  I'd probably try to divide up the tests run those that work on phantomjs on phantomjs and the rest on a non-headless browser. I'd probably use chrome instead of FF since it is a bit more performant (at least in speed).
