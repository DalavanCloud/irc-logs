[2014-10-02 02:27:11] tommi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-02 02:28:51] tommi: Hi, We have a problem where our Selenium tests runs fine in Intellij, but when we run them via maven, we get various errors. Among them "Stale Element Exception". Java versions is the same. Any ideas why this might be ?
[2014-10-02 02:31:47] WhereIsMySpoon: tommi: when you run them via maven, are they running on a different machine? or its all on the same machine
[2014-10-02 02:32:09] tommi: WhereIsMySpoon: The same machine..
[2014-10-02 02:32:54] WhereIsMySpoon: so literally the only difference is that instead of right clicking on your test package and running it, you're running mvn test ?
[2014-10-02 02:33:31] WhereIsMySpoon: do your tests maybe conflict with each other? if you were running them separately from intellij, maybe running all of them in maven is creating some issues
[2014-10-02 02:35:35] tommi: We are running a "test configuration" from intelliJ.
[2014-10-02 02:37:45] WhereIsMySpoon: dont really know what that means
[2014-10-02 02:37:49] WhereIsMySpoon: ive not used intellij
[2014-10-02 02:40:11] tommi: WhereIsMySpoon: Ok. Our thought is also that the tests somehow gets run independently in IntelliJ. We need to investigate some more...
[2014-10-02 02:43:24] *cable puts on his detective hat and looking glass... im on it! :p'
[2014-10-02 02:44:32] cable: tommi are you sure this element is in view of the browser? I had a weird error lately where selenium couldn't find the element only because it wass'nt in the view port.

[2014-10-02 02:57:55] AutomatedTester: snappy: the minor number, the 1, is for client libraries to do their own releases. We havent had a reason for a .1 so havent released it
[2014-10-02 02:58:37] AutomatedTester: snappy: we do indeed start Firefox twice, we do a dirty profile and then ask Firefox to clean it up before running tests
[2014-10-02 03:00:30] WhereIsMySpoon: pretty sure chrome does the same thing
[2014-10-02 03:01:09] AutomatedTester: starting the browser twice?

[2014-10-02 03:03:16] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: I rarely use chrome for my testing so it could be doing that
[2014-10-02 03:03:32] WhereIsMySpoon: meaning that stuff like document.write make it not work
[2014-10-02 03:03:53] WhereIsMySpoon: unless you put it on a small timer

[2014-10-02 04:17:25] jimevans: just looking at your visibility patch
[2014-10-02 04:17:29] jimevans: for the spec
[2014-10-02 04:17:35] jimevans: impressive.
[2014-10-02 04:18:02] ato: I found some issues with it.
[2014-10-02 04:18:24] jimevans: such as?
[2014-10-02 04:18:57] ato: Oh I can't remember from the top of my head, but I think there's an infinite recursion somewhere and a lacking return statement or something like htat.
[2014-10-02 04:19:04] jimevans: ah
[2014-10-02 04:19:38] wilhelm: Agreed! It's an awesome patch.
[2014-10-02 04:19:59] ato: Well it's not perfect, but we know that.
[2014-10-02 04:20:14] ato: I think it might be better than what's there right now though.
[2014-10-02 04:20:17] jimevans: the only thing i'd change format-wise is the last section where you say "return false if any of the following conditions evaluate to false"
[2014-10-02 04:21:09] snappy: AutomatedTester: right now im using chrome, but i want to test some downloading aspects of this web app, and chrome has all these nanny features like "this file may harm your computer" which can't be bloody disabled
[2014-10-02 04:21:44] jimevans: instead, i'd enumerate each condition.
[2014-10-02 04:21:49] snappy: so i normally use firefox driver for that, but firefox has just been trouble lately

[2014-10-02 04:27:38] ato: jimevans: “If condition … is false, return false”?
[2014-10-02 04:27:47] jimevans: yes. exactly so.
[2014-10-02 04:27:55] jimevans: but that's a style choice, i suppose.
[2014-10-02 04:28:53] jimb, quitting. (Quit: jimb)
[2014-10-02 04:28:59] ato: Sure we could do that, I was just trying to save some typing and long sentences.
[2014-10-02 04:29:43] ato: It's also problematic that the algorithm only deals with rectangles.
[2014-10-02 04:30:01] ato: But I don't know enough geometry to figure it out.
[2014-10-02 04:30:57] jimevans: let me take another, closer look with it properly formatted into a document (rather than trying to read the source diff)
[2014-10-02 04:32:58] ato: You can apply it and run make.
[2014-10-02 04:33:10] ato: Or wait, I think webdriver-spec.html is already generated in that patch.

[2014-10-02 04:51:54] ato: As opposed to the style value?  Yes.
[2014-10-02 04:52:08] ato: It's el.style.display vs window.getComputedStyle(el).display.
[2014-10-02 04:54:05] jimevans: yeah, we should explicitly call that out.
[2014-10-02 04:55:05] ato: Yeah, there are several things in there which would be wrong if we didn't.
[2014-10-02 04:55:13] ato: Relying heavily on the computed style here.
[2014-10-02 04:55:39] ato: Basically we'd have to do a whole lot more normalization and left/right/bottom/top checks if not.

[2014-10-02 05:06:35] *WhereIsMySpoon takes a look'
[2014-10-02 05:09:28] WhereIsMySpoon: that is...difficult to read, in just the diff
[2014-10-02 05:09:53] ato: You can apply the diff to the repo and read webdriver-spec.html.
[2014-10-02 05:09:57] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: can you tl;dr the original issue and what your patch fixes?
[2014-10-02 05:11:34] ato: The issue is that we should have a rationale for why and when the html and immediate succeeding body elements are considered visible or not visible.  There turned out to be a bug in the CSS spec which is now fixed.  The patch turns the list of visibility demands into an algorithm.
[2014-10-02 05:13:49] WhereIsMySpoon: why would the body element ever not be visible?

[2014-10-02 05:15:29] WhereIsMySpoon: actually nvm that question
[2014-10-02 05:15:34] WhereIsMySpoon: why does it -matter- if theyre visible or not
[2014-10-02 05:15:37] ato: There's a long explanation in the second comment, but basically if the computed background-color of the first body element is "transparent", it gets transposed on to the canvas unless html is defined to have a background.
[2014-10-02 05:15:43] WhereIsMySpoon: theyre just another element
[2014-10-02 05:15:51] ato: html and body are special.
[2014-10-02 05:15:56] WhereIsMySpoon: how so
[2014-10-02 05:16:12] ato: Because their background-color gets transposed.
[2014-10-02 05:16:18] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-10-02 05:16:34] WhereIsMySpoon: what issue does this create
[2014-10-02 05:16:37] ato: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds/#special-backgrounds
[2014-10-02 05:16:56] ato: Well first of all that WebDriver's assumptions and the CSS specifications were wrong.
[2014-10-02 05:18:19] jimb: WhereIsMySpoon:
[2014-10-02 05:18:23] jimb: gah
[2014-10-02 05:18:48] jimb: WhereIsMySpoon: remember my "my tests are not running in parallel"-issue
[2014-10-02 05:18:48] jimb: ?
[2014-10-02 05:19:00] jimb: well, it turns out they are…. but not :-/
[2014-10-02 05:19:36] jimb: I timed the execution, running with 4 nodes, 4 tests get started witin half a second of eachother
[2014-10-02 05:19:39] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: I see, so it would mean that webdriver would think that sometimes it couldnt find an element even though it was visible because the canvas was transparent, and similar issues?
[2014-10-02 05:20:19] ato: Well this is an edge case, but in the case of determining the visibility of body, yes.
[2014-10-02 05:20:52] jimb: Running them locally on my mbp they take ~60s (4 parallell processes/threads, 8 tests in total)
[2014-10-02 05:21:18] jimb: Running them on our grid-"system" they take ~330s
[2014-10-02 05:21:27] WhereIsMySpoon: jimb: O.o
[2014-10-02 05:22:06] jimb: I'm kinda lost… where would I start troubleshooting?
[2014-10-02 05:22:40] WhereIsMySpoon: jimb: can you see the tests running in parallel on your grid system?
[2014-10-02 05:23:11] jimb: not really :( all the nodes are started in session 0 isolation
[2014-10-02 05:23:21] jimb: hub and nodes (4) are all on different VM's
[2014-10-02 05:24:09] jimb: hmm… I remember seeing a command to get view-access to session 0, but I can't do it on 4 machines simultaneously…
[2014-10-02 05:24:39] WhereIsMySpoon: are you on linux?
[2014-10-02 05:24:48] jimb: nope :(

[2014-10-02 05:24:59] WhereIsMySpoon: uhm
[2014-10-02 05:25:04] jimb: but I've been pushing to move to linux instead

[2014-10-02 05:25:48] jimb: we're doing a company-wide effort to move development including dev-ops to linux (to use Docker)
[2014-10-02 05:26:26] jimb: But the testing-community is like: "a majority of our users use windows, so we should test on windows…"
[2014-10-02 05:26:37] WhereIsMySpoon: yes, testing != dev
[2014-10-02 05:26:47] WhereIsMySpoon: do uat on the end user env
[2014-10-02 05:27:06] WhereIsMySpoon: do dev on whatever environment makes the most sense in terms of dev efficiency
[2014-10-02 05:28:03] jimb: yeah, problem is we're kinda at the stage where we not only do uat but we have kinda of "test everything via selenium"-mindset.
[2014-10-02 05:28:11] jimb: and for that, windows is no good...
[2014-10-02 05:28:39] jimb: too much data-validation thru Seln to keep me sane… but that's a different discussion
[2014-10-02 05:28:41] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: how very curious
[2014-10-02 05:29:20] jimb: back to logging… when you say driver-logging, feel like elaborating?
[2014-10-02 05:29:31] WhereIsMySpoon: no never, you must find out alone!!!11

[2014-10-02 05:31:19] WhereIsMySpoon: obviously, you'll need to name them appropriately for the different nodes that they'll be coming from
[2014-10-02 05:31:55] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise your logs will overwrite each other :D
[2014-10-02 05:32:12] WhereIsMySpoon: do this when the test is finished

[2014-10-02 07:13:20] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Nice.  Invariably someone will suggest an API to query the driver's capabilities to avoid roundtrips.
[2014-10-02 07:13:48] barancev: \o/
[2014-10-02 07:13:55] ato: I think I'm for.
[2014-10-02 07:13:56] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you get them on newSession so that case is covered
[2014-10-02 07:14:44] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 820
[2014-10-02 07:15:20] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Oh?  Has the spec deviated from WebDriver?  Because currently you can request capabilities that aren't returned back.  It's kinda odd.
[2014-10-02 07:15:28] nirvdrum: Proxy is that case, incidentally.
[2014-10-02 07:15:38] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: interesting
[2014-10-02 07:15:38] nirvdrum: So you can't even rely on the response to tell whether a proxy has been established :-/
[2014-10-02 07:16:16] nirvdrum: I spoke at length with Eran about this back in the day.  Supposedly there just isn't a strong contract there.
[2014-10-02 07:16:18] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you are supposed to get back the capabilities that have been fulfilled and any others the browser has done
[2014-10-02 07:16:46] nirvdrum: Okay.  Maybe that got changed.  I'll have to give it a shot.
[2014-10-02 07:17:03] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: if it hasnt changed then we have more deviation from the spec
[2014-10-02 07:17:28] AutomatedTester: capabilties are supposed to tell you what the session is capable of
[2014-10-02 07:17:37] ato: nirvdrum: That you can request capabilities that aren't returned is the mess of desired vs. required capabilities, isn't it?
[2014-10-02 07:18:26] nirvdrum: ato: Well, there's two parts.  1) the driver doesn't need to honor them, which is annoying; 2) the driver may not even tell you if it honored it, so you can't even account for the cases where it hasn't honored them.
[2014-10-02 07:18:38] nirvdrum: The failure case and the success case look the same in that situation.
[2014-10-02 07:18:45] ato: nirvdrum: ++
[2014-10-02 07:18:52] nirvdrum: Until you try to do something you expect to work and then it fails.

[2014-10-02 07:19:08] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you are welcome to reply to my email
[2014-10-02 07:19:09] nirvdrum: But often times that means locking the browser up for me.
[2014-10-02 07:19:11] AutomatedTester: anyone can
[2014-10-02 07:19:21] ato: I'd be in favour of forcing the remote to fail if one of the capability requirements can't be met.
[2014-10-02 07:19:39] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I'll investigate a bit more here.  I'm heading out for a flight in an hour, so it may take me a few days.
[2014-10-02 07:19:40] ato: Doesn't matter if it's the driver or a proxy.
[2014-10-02 07:19:50] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: no rush :)
[2014-10-02 07:19:53] AutomatedTester: have a safe flight
[2014-10-02 07:19:54] nirvdrum: ato: That's the idea behind required capabilities.
[2014-10-02 07:20:03] ato: But the problem with specifying this in the spec is that we don't /know/ about what the capabilities that are required are.
[2014-10-02 07:20:29] nirvdrum: ato: Which is why I suggested someone will be looking for a "list all capabilities the remote has" API so you don't get into try-catch loops.
[2014-10-02 07:20:32] ato: Because we can't say that Firefox requires these things, and IE these things.
[2014-10-02 07:20:57] ato: Well I don't think it's necessarily a problem.
[2014-10-02 07:21:00] nirvdrum: The strongest argument against required capabilities is if you want graceful degradation, you're going to make multiple roundtrips until the client and server agree on a set.
[2014-10-02 07:21:09] ato: I think it's a bigger problem that you request IE on a Linux machine and you get Firefox.
[2014-10-02 07:21:15] nirvdrum: I concur.
[2014-10-02 07:21:15] ato: Fail early and fail fast.
[2014-10-02 07:21:32] nirvdrum: But there's a big mountain that needs to be moved on this one :-)
[2014-10-02 07:22:27] ato: I think you're one of the people that needs to think hard about this one.
[2014-10-02 07:22:46] ato: I'm seeing things from a driver implementor's perspective.
[2014-10-02 07:22:53] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Anyway, that's why I suggested a query API.  I could actually see it being useful from a grid perspective, too.  I could have a dashboard that queries the capabilities of each remote.  But that may be too esoteric a use case.
[2014-10-02 07:23:22] nirvdrum: ato: From an implementor perspective, I don't think desired caps make sense at all.
[2014-10-02 07:23:36] nirvdrum: But, I'm not an implementor, so what do I know? :-P
[2014-10-02 07:23:38] ato: nirvdrum: ++
[2014-10-02 07:23:45] ato: We are agreeing an awful lot today.
[2014-10-02 07:23:47] ato: (-:
[2014-10-02 07:23:48] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2014-10-02 07:23:58] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I can see that being useful but when nodes register with each other they can be passing that info on at that time
[2014-10-02 07:23:59] nirvdrum: From a client perspective, I don't think it makes a ton of sense either.
[2014-10-02 07:24:11] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Fair point.
[2014-10-02 07:24:15] ato: nirvdrum: Are you able to be in Santa Clara for TPAC?
[2014-10-02 07:24:32] nirvdrum: That's in a couple weeks?
[2014-10-02 07:24:37] nirvdrum: I completely forgot about it.

[2014-10-02 10:30:16] KyleG: Am I at a disadvantage for not having a real GPU on my selenium nodes? I'm using a Supermicro blade server w/ ESXi for Windows selenium nodes.
[2014-10-02 10:30:41] KyleG: I'm wondering if I would see the best performance with a basic tower or even adding a GPU to the server blade and using VMWare Workstation or something on a windows install
[2014-10-02 10:31:04] p_l|backup: not really, as long as you don't use gpu-intensive things in pages
[2014-10-02 10:31:34] p_l|backup: also, you can probably get a quadro working with ESXi
[2014-10-02 10:31:39] KyleG: well, we're a digital asset management company, so our testing does involve uploading images/videos and testing playback

[2014-10-02 12:27:42] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-10-02 12:27:59] dude-x: soloslinger: you can turn on "implicit waits"
[2014-10-02 12:28:08] dude-x: but that only works for simple websites
[2014-10-02 12:28:21] dude-x: so you have to use a WebDriverWait (or write your own polling loop)
[2014-10-02 12:29:22] soloslinger: dude-x: Hmm.  Ok.  I must be screwing up the syntax of WebDriverWait then.  I'll hafta look into what else I can do with that.  The example has it waiting on an element to be clicked.
[2014-10-02 12:29:29] soloslinger: dude-x: Thanks.
[2014-10-02 12:29:59] dude-x: webdriver wait creates a wait object that is initialized with the driver, and timeout in seconds
[2014-10-02 12:30:38] dude-x: then you can call the until method, which takes a function object (or ExpectedCondition object if you're in Java/C#) which will then be evaluated for a result
[2014-10-02 12:31:18] dude-x: if the result is an exception or false boolean, then it will try again until it gets a truthy result or it time outs
[2014-10-02 12:33:01] dude-x: the simplest case is waiting for an element to be there (thus ignoring NoElementExceptions)
[2014-10-02 12:33:24] dude-x: but you can write your own functions that can do things like ignore empty text, or get at least one element from get_elements, and so on
[2014-10-02 12:33:38] soloslinger: dude-x: Ok. Thanks. Then the next thing I need to look at is the ExpectedCondition object.
[2014-10-02 12:34:06] dude-x: there are some ExpectedConditions already defined in Java
