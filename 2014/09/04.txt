[2014-09-04 00:26:45] Aditya: Hi Guys I want to check with you how we can handel an unexpected window popup or Alert or Web Based Pop up using selenium webdriver
[2014-09-04 00:32:07] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 822
[2014-09-04 00:34:02] ato: Aditya: In most languages you need to wrap your call in a try-catch block.
[2014-09-04 00:34:13] d0x: Aditya: hm, i did it like this: http://pastebin.com/fQyLE57S
[2014-09-04 00:34:21] d0x: But i don't know whether this is elegant
[2014-09-04 00:34:32] d0x: and the print() calls i removed by a proxy
[2014-09-04 00:34:36] ato: Basically you need to make sure that the response from the webdriver server isn't an error.
[2014-09-04 00:37:15] Aditya: So with a try catch block approach you want me to add  try block with each test case to handle an unexpected alert & my test execution in the catch block or finally block ?

[2014-09-04 07:23:06] operatiay: hey guys (and ladies), I've got a question about xpath in Selenium. Is it possible to use a variable in the xpath finder? it should be something like "//a[@attribute=$variable]/b[@attribute2=$variable]"
[2014-09-04 07:23:29] operatiay: so the value of attribute and attribute2 should be exactly the same
[2014-09-04 07:23:45] operatiay: in such a case b should be selected
[2014-09-04 07:24:29] operatiay: I know there is a way to do it in xslt, but how would I do it in Selenium context?
[2014-09-04 07:26:06] bl4ckscor3: isn't the xpath you define a string? you could just make a string variable and put it in there. "//a[@attribute=" + variable + "]/b[@attribute2=" + variable + "]"
[2014-09-04 07:26:39] ato: operatiay: "//a[@attribute=%s]\b[@attribute2=%s]" % (first, second)
[2014-09-04 07:26:41] operatiay: the problem is that I don't know this value when I write the xpath selection string
[2014-09-04 07:27:09] ato: Well then no, XPath is an expression not a language.
[2014-09-04 07:27:21] ato: Fetch the first one first, then use that in the second expression.
[2014-09-04 07:27:53] operatiay: I've got a list of things I have to work with. I wanted to fetch only those I am interested in...
[2014-09-04 07:29:20] operatiay: such a pity... :( I'll have to iterate over the elements and fetch the children, basically doing the logic manually. this would take ages during the execution time
[2014-09-04 07:29:30] SamuraiJack_, quitting. (Read error: No route to host)
[2014-09-04 07:30:07] ato: If you don't know the value beforehand you will need to do that anyways?
[2014-09-04 07:30:17] ato: Also don't use XPath if it's speed you're after.
[2014-09-04 07:30:47] operatiay: what I do know is the fact that the attribute value is exactly the same for those two nodes...

Should we build more stuff in "Build All Java" jobs so Firefox jobs don't need to or increase give JVMs more memory or ..? (I'm not sure what's going on there with buck)
