[2014-09-19 02:01:35] VaticanCameos: the website needs to be provided too
[2014-09-19 02:02:02] VaticanCameos: but I'm not sure I can share it, it being the company's staging version on which tests are run.
[2014-09-19 02:02:40] VaticanCameos: ato: This is the HTML: "<input class="form-control required" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your E-mail / Username" required="" type="text" value="">"
[2014-09-19 02:02:52] VaticanCameos: Ive provided everything that is needed in the HTML link
[2014-09-19 02:03:18] VaticanCameos: sorry, the SO link*
[2014-09-19 02:04:31] VaticanCameos: The problem is that answers to similar questions on SO direct me to use get_attribute('value')
[2014-09-19 02:04:36] VaticanCameos: But I can't do that here
[2014-09-19 02:04:48] VaticanCameos: presumably because value is set as empty in the tag as an attribute already.
[2014-09-19 02:05:33] VaticanCameos: On printing (find_element.get_attribute('value')) I get a blank line.
[2014-09-19 02:07:38] VaticanCameos: ato: what else do you need?
[2014-09-19 02:13:03] WhereIsMySpoon: VaticanCameos: why are you trying to verify the input box text?
[2014-09-19 02:13:18] WhereIsMySpoon: all you're doing with that is testing that selenium works, which the selenium team do themselves
[2014-09-19 02:13:25] WhereIsMySpoon: seems pointless
[2014-09-19 02:13:57] VaticanCameos: WhereIsMySpoon: is it not logical to check whether the text was entered correctly?

[2014-09-19 02:26:33] Dave_B_: assuming your company has a public production site with the same code we could look at it there?
[2014-09-19 02:27:06] Dave_B_: also I'd agree that the check there is pretty odd, but still maybe worth looking at your issue as you may need to read input values elsewhere
[2014-09-19 02:27:18] Dave_B_: if we can see what went wrong then that'll help :)
[2014-09-19 02:38:44] WhereIsMySpoon: VaticanCameos:not really, if that was the case then every time you make a selenium call you need to check that the value that selenium returned is the one you expected
[2014-09-19 02:38:50] WhereIsMySpoon: every single time
[2014-09-19 02:38:53] WhereIsMySpoon: which is absurd
[2014-09-19 02:39:12] WhereIsMySpoon: you test whether your application responds in the way you expect, not that selenium works
[2014-09-19 02:39:30] VaticanCameos: Dave_B_: the production site seems to be down right now, I tried to run tests on it.
[2014-09-19 02:40:17] WhereIsMySpoon: VaticanCameos: the same logic applies to testing file downloads - you click your "download" button then check the response you get back with a custom url call and response check, and you do NOT check the file itself
[2014-09-19 02:40:28] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise you are just checking that the browser file download utility works, which is poitnless
[2014-09-19 02:40:29] VaticanCameos: WhereIsMySpoon: you have a point.
[2014-09-19 02:40:30] WhereIsMySpoon: pointless*
[2014-09-19 02:41:10] WhereIsMySpoon: VaticanCameos: do you also check that every python call you make does the right thing every time you write a line of code? :D
[2014-09-19 02:41:17] VaticanCameos: WhereIsMySpoon: not at all.
[2014-09-19 02:41:24] WhereIsMySpoon: well then

[2014-09-19 02:43:57] WhereIsMySpoon: now, if you had for example 2 input boxes, box 2 which had a listener on it for when box 1 got typed into, that it copies the text over, then you would have a case to test the box value

[2014-09-19 03:14:30] netdog: ok :) i'm planning to use selenium not for testing. i'd like to have a browser instance running constantly and use selenium to inject browser controlls

[2014-09-19 03:14:58] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: what do you mean sorry?
[2014-09-19 03:15:20] netdog: selenium is used for browser automation
[2014-09-19 03:15:24] MalekAlrwily: what is the minimum RAM required for selenium?
[2014-09-19 03:16:16] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: I'd imagine seen as it's a java-based thing, 2gb or so would be more than sufficient
[2014-09-19 03:16:24] WhereIsMySpoon: why
[2014-09-19 03:16:28] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog:yes
[2014-09-19 03:16:33] netdog: WhereIsMySpoon: means: you define a test, run it, it ends after that.
[2014-09-19 03:16:35] MalekAlrwily: 2 gb? WOW
[2014-09-19 03:16:51] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: "would be more than sufficient"
[2014-09-19 03:17:02] MalekAlrwily: I want to host it on a vps
[2014-09-19 03:17:06] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: dont forget you haev to run the OS, the browser, probably your IDE
[2014-09-19 03:17:12] MalekAlrwily: so 2 g will be expensive
[2014-09-19 03:17:16] MalekAlrwily: gb*
[2014-09-19 03:17:17] WhereIsMySpoon: right ok thewn its a different question
[2014-09-19 03:17:44] MalekAlrwily: I want to just put it in a jar file
[2014-09-19 03:17:45] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno honestly
[2014-09-19 03:18:00] WhereIsMySpoon: Why dont you run the hub yourself and see?
[2014-09-19 03:18:15] netdog: WIMS: i like to have a browser running in fullscreen constantly and control it via an external script
[2014-09-19 03:18:29] MalekAlrwily: WhereIsMySpeen: Good idea bro
[2014-09-19 03:18:32] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: are you lookign to have a hub and nodes, or just run selenium scripts
[2014-09-19 03:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: what does this have to do with selenium
[2014-09-19 03:19:17] MalekAlrwily: I want to control the selenium remotly
[2014-09-19 03:19:28] MalekAlrwily: because it is not supported in android
[2014-09-19 03:19:47] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: yes it is
[2014-09-19 03:20:12] netdog: WIMS: selenium gives me that features as far as i got that right. but it's not designed to control browser constantly, right?
[2014-09-19 03:20:20] MalekAlrwily: so I want to host it on vps to allow my app users to connect the vps and do selenium stuff
[2014-09-19 03:20:36] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: there is an android set of bindings for selenium
[2014-09-19 03:20:40] WhereIsMySpoon: look up selendroid
[2014-09-19 03:20:44] WhereIsMySpoon: or appium
[2014-09-19 03:20:49] MalekAlrwily: I have
[2014-09-19 03:21:02] MalekAlrwily: but it is for test android not browser
[2014-09-19 03:21:58] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: to be honest, I'd say that you're going to get a quicker answer if you try to set up whatever you want to set up on your local machine, and count up the RAM it uses
[2014-09-19 03:22:23] WhereIsMySpoon: I cant imagine selenium itself using more than a few 10s of MB
[2014-09-19 03:22:38] WhereIsMySpoon: the browser, the OS, and whatever else you have...thats on you

[2014-09-19 03:23:06] netdog: WIMS: for better understanding: i want to use a kinect to detect swipes from left to right/r2l controlling a JS based image preview
[2014-09-19 03:24:21] WhereIsMySpoon: why do you need selenium for this? Is it going to be something like someone swipes -> kinect detects -> sends msg to selenium somehow -> selenium sends message to browser to move image left/right ?
[2014-09-19 03:24:45] netdog: WIMS: exactly
[2014-09-19 03:24:56] netdog: how would you do that?
[2014-09-19 03:25:42] netdog: i don't want to do it via a browser plugin
[2014-09-19 03:27:01] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: I dont see why you cant use selenium for this, just have it as a part of your server-side project, open up a browser, then create 2 methods moveLeft and moveRight, then create some sort of listener pattern or restful api to your server that responds to requests from your kinect
[2014-09-19 03:27:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and your moveLeft/moveRight methods do whatever you need to do
[2014-09-19 03:27:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know anything about kinects

[2014-09-19 03:29:42] netdog: hehe, not yet, but soon hopefully.... the unclear thing about useing selenium was, if it's just a script that runs a test and terminates afterwards, or if selenium keeps the "connection" to the browser instance open so that i can send that left/right controlls whenever i want

[2014-09-19 03:30:57] MalekAlrwily: What differences between selenium server and client?
[2014-09-19 03:31:29] WhereIsMySpoon: there is no "selenium client"
[2014-09-19 03:31:32] WhereIsMySpoon: the client is the browser
[2014-09-19 03:32:27] netdog: WIMS: so i can inject/call actions anytime i want... interesting... i'm just wonderig how that works.. as far as i know it's based on a JS library that is injected to the website. but how does selenium server "tell" the js script within the webpage, that an event was thrown?
[2014-09-19 03:32:32] MalekAlrwily: "Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings" in selenium website
[2014-09-19 03:33:03] WhereIsMySpoon: it's perhaps badly worded
[2014-09-19 03:33:32] WhereIsMySpoon: MalekAlrwily: in a nutshell, you create a selenium script. You then run said script. Even if you run it locally, a selenium server will be started up, which communicates with the browser, sending commands to it
[2014-09-19 03:34:06] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: it communicates with a restful api using the wire protocol
[2014-09-19 03:34:25] MalekAlrwily: so I should use selenium client to automate websites, right?
[2014-09-19 03:34:56] WhereIsMySpoon: you use selenium to automate websites, i dont think i've ever heard someone say "selenium client"
[2014-09-19 03:35:13] MalekAlrwily: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
[2014-09-19 03:35:16] WhereIsMySpoon: the closest thing to a selenium "client" is the ide (which is deprecated"
[2014-09-19 03:35:34] netdog: WIMS: wire protocol. never heard about that. google will help.  so the question is now: which programming language should be used to start and run a selenium "object" without crashing after 5 days running
[2014-09-19 03:35:34] MalekAlrwily: please see the link
[2014-09-19 03:35:41] WhereIsMySpoon: yes, MalekAlrwily "you need to make use of language-specific client drivers."
[2014-09-19 03:35:44] WhereIsMySpoon: client drivers
[2014-09-19 03:35:49] WhereIsMySpoon: like <chrome> driver
[2014-09-19 03:35:52] WhereIsMySpoon: <firefox> driver
[2014-09-19 03:35:55] WhereIsMySpoon: <opera> driver
[2014-09-19 03:35:59] WhereIsMySpoon: see where Im going?
[2014-09-19 03:36:01] MalekAlrwily: ok thank you
[2014-09-19 03:36:57] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: not a clue, I'd imagine they're all fairly stable, though the .net bindings (using c#) will probably have the smallest footprint
[2014-09-19 03:37:15] WhereIsMySpoon: or maybe javascript
[2014-09-19 03:37:34] WhereIsMySpoon: i use java myself but thats cause that's what I and my company are familiar with
[2014-09-19 03:38:08] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: I'd like to make a disclaimer that this isn't -really- what selenium is used for, so don't be surprised if you get some weird issues running it for a very long tiem
[2014-09-19 03:38:19] netdog: WIMS: node.js (serverside JS) might be the right thing... i found a PHP class for selenium, but PHP might be the worse program language concerning stability when running a script a long time
[2014-09-19 03:38:42] WhereIsMySpoon: dont use php
[2014-09-19 03:38:47] netdog: yeah :)
[2014-09-19 03:38:59] WhereIsMySpoon: 1) php sucks 2) the php bindings are terrible 3) there are about 5 different bindings 4) the php selenium community sucks
[2014-09-19 03:39:04] WhereIsMySpoon: 5) they arent official
[2014-09-19 03:39:14] netdog: i c. thx for that info
[2014-09-19 03:39:40] netdog: i guess i'll try node.js ... i'm more familiar with JS than with java/c#
[2014-09-19 03:39:42] WhereIsMySpoon: netdog: you know you can just type the first few letters of my name then press tab?
[2014-09-19 03:39:50] WhereIsMySpoon: most irc clients will autocomplete the name
[2014-09-19 03:40:02] netdog: WhereIsMySpoon: thx for that hint!

[2014-09-19 04:11:07] rmaja_: i think not. i only log into twitter par example

[2014-09-19 06:28:39] jimevans: okay, general architecture question.
[2014-09-19 06:30:01] jimevans: in broad terms, what does the language binding/driver need to know to configure and launch a local instance of firefox (ignore the remote case for the moment)? off the top of my head, it's profile settings set by the user, browser extensions to be installed in the profile, and the location of the firefox binary.
[2014-09-19 06:30:15] jimevans: simonstewart, AutomatedTester, ato:
[2014-09-19 06:30:17] jimevans: ^^
[2014-09-19 06:30:48] AutomatedTester: I think that should be it
[2014-09-19 06:31:01] AutomatedTester: profile and binary the main things

[2014-09-19 06:33:50] jimevans: nothing in particular, no. i'm not happy with the way the .NET language bindings handle firefox, and haven't been for awhile now. i'm starting to think about rearchitecture.

[2014-09-19 06:38:30] ato: Last I looked at the different bindings, the Ruby code seemed the best structured to me.
[2014-09-19 06:38:39] jimevans: plus, i think the profile management pieces don't match the reference implementation (python)
[2014-09-19 06:42:00] jimevans: as for the remote case, zipping the profile and shipping the whole damned thing across the wire in a base64-encoded blob seems inefficient to me. seems to me we could be more efficient if we only sent what we needed to, only sending the whole profile if the user really wanted to. (i admit i haven't followed this line of thinking all the way through, and i'm sure there are huge, gaping flaws in it)
[2014-09-19 06:42:37] ato: It is really inefficient but that's mainly because of the .xpi I think.
[2014-09-19 06:43:06] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: there does seem to be a lot of default info sent to the driver on startup that could probably just be baked in
[2014-09-19 06:43:20] WhereIsMySpoon: for all bindings
[2014-09-19 06:43:33] jimevans: thinking forwardly, though, we won't have to ship that xpi eventually, right?
[2014-09-19 06:43:38] jimevans: :)
[2014-09-19 06:43:45] AutomatedTester: jimevans: iirc... the python code only sends the setting over, unless there is an addon
[2014-09-19 06:43:47] *AutomatedTester looks'
[2014-09-19 06:43:47] ato: With Marionette you should be able to tell Firefox to just create a new profile on launch.

[2014-09-19 06:57:50] AutomatedTester: so... you dont indent your ruby? are you some kind of monster to your colleagues?
[2014-09-19 06:58:02] WhereIsMySpoon: of course i indent code
[2014-09-19 06:58:15] WhereIsMySpoon: i just find big code blocks difficult to read without brakcets
[2014-09-19 06:59:12] WhereIsMySpoon: its just a personal thing :)
[2014-09-19 06:59:20] WhereIsMySpoon: but mostly I havent done much python, tahts all

[2014-09-19 07:37:52] AutomatedTester: your interpretation of it
[2014-09-19 07:37:53] Dave_B_: may have involved cutting up a card to make a mask and then icing-sugaring it
[2014-09-19 07:38:25] Dave_B_: but the cake was brown and it was for a wedding so needed to whiten it up a bit, ended up with a nice picture of a wedding cake on the wedding cake

[2014-09-19 08:54:10] dimacus: jimevans: someone claims that 32bit IEDriver is not compatible with 64 IE, is that correct? I thought you mentioned that IE is technically 52Bit app, thus a 32bit driver can still control 64bit IE
[2014-09-19 08:54:15] *dimacus got tongue tied'
[2014-09-19 08:54:28] Silne30, quitting. ()
[2014-09-19 08:54:39] jimevans: dimacus: the answer is "it depends by what you mean by 'compatible'"
[2014-09-19 08:55:05] dimacus: jimevans: https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras/issues/39
[2014-09-19 08:55:48] jimevans: for IE <= 9, it's "32-bit IE driver drives 32-bit IE; 64-bit IE driver drives 64-bit IE". IE >= 10, things are much more complicated.
[2014-09-19 08:56:07] dimacus: oi
[2014-09-19 08:56:15] dimacus: complicated is good right? :-P
[2014-09-19 08:56:29] dimacus: ok i guess i'll go and explore this more then
[2014-09-19 08:56:35] robins, changing nick to robinsmidsrod.
[2014-09-19 08:56:41] jimevans: well for the 80% case, "complicated" means "use the 32-bit driver if you want sendKeys to work"
[2014-09-19 08:56:51] dimacus: gotcha
[2014-09-19 08:56:52] jimevans: see my blog for details
[2014-09-19 08:57:13] dimacus: can you remind me the link to the blog? i'll find the individual post myself
[2014-09-19 08:58:08] jimevans: also, fwiw, for IE <= 9, the 32-bit version of IE was always the default, even on 64-bit windows, so it's vastly more likely that a user of any given site will be using 32-bit IE.
[2014-09-19 08:58:20] jimevans: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com.
[2014-09-19 08:58:30] jimevans: most recent post talks about 32- vs. 64-bit IE

[2014-09-19 09:48:14] WhereIsMySpoon: theabrar: I confused you I think. Just remove the "xpath="
[2014-09-19 09:48:24] WhereIsMySpoon: dont replace with anything, just remove

[2014-09-19 10:27:04] jimevans: so you want to verify functionality of the browser, that the browser manufacturer has (presumably) already tested, and if it fails there's nothing you can do about it.

[2014-09-19 11:58:13] LocusAsaf: jarib: I do but like I said the css/html properties are basically the same before & after the animation
[2014-09-19 11:58:41] LocusAsaf: its like this...graph is loaded...change date range of graph...graph animates to account for changes...graph is loaded
[2014-09-19 11:59:15] jarib: so you could wait for it to have the expected data
[2014-09-19 11:59:45] jarib: or you'll have to dig in and see how the animation is implemented
[2014-09-19 12:00:18] LocusAsaf: jarib: I really wish it was easier to do that
[2014-09-19 12:00:35] LocusAsaf: or alternatively it would be awesome if there was a tool that could record the changes that happen to the css

[2014-09-19 15:11:23] *AutomatedTester goes to get scotch because he is clearly grumpy'
[2014-09-19 15:11:41] santiycr: amen, brother
[2014-09-19 15:11:52] smccarthy: those who say alcohol never solved anything, never had a good glass of scotch
[2014-09-19 15:12:06] AutomatedTester: I am low on scotch
[2014-09-19 15:12:08] santiycr: :)
[2014-09-19 15:12:26] santiycr: sauce's bar is pretty decent these days

[2014-09-19 15:12:51] AutomatedTester: mi casa su casa
[2014-09-19 15:12:56] AutomatedTester: or something like that
[2014-09-19 15:13:30] santiycr: I'll send some vino your way
[2014-09-19 15:13:39] AutomatedTester: that will do too
[2014-09-19 15:13:41] AutomatedTester: :)
