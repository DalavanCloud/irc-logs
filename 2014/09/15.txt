[2014-09-15 12:24:43] machtyn: Here's a ByChained() question. I saw someone mention in an answer on a forum that they use ByChained to combine a CSS Selector with an XPath selector to travel back up an hierarchy.  I'm trying to figure out how to do this, but I'm not getting it.  Does anyone here know how that might be done?
[2014-09-15 12:25:39] cgoldberg: Guest84264, in your TestCase, use an addClenup() to clean what you want in temp after each case executes.  that way it will cleanup even if the driver crashes and doesn't get to cleaning
[2014-09-15 12:25:43] Blaster, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-15 12:26:19] cgoldberg: sorry..type:  addCleanup() ... add it within your setUp method

[2014-09-15 12:26:38] Guest84264: webdriver.addCleanup ?
[2014-09-15 12:27:15] cgoldberg: Guest84264, no  self.addCleup(cleanup_funtion)  .. then write a cleanup_funtion() to clean temp
[2014-09-15 12:27:59] cgoldberg: Guest30141, you are using unittest TestCase derived classes i assume.. for your tests?
[2014-09-15 12:28:04] Guest84264: ho yeah it could be good
[2014-09-15 12:28:45] cgoldberg: Guest84264,  here:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup
[2014-09-15 12:28:56] cgoldberg: use those instead of writing tearDown classes

[2014-09-15 21:40:52] porjo: I'm trying to run selenium-server jar file. I'm launching like this: 'java -jar /opt/selenium/selenium-server.jar' and get as far as 'Started HttpContext[/,/]' and then hangs i.e. it never starts to listen on TCP port 4444. If I ctrl+c it quits, but I then have a 'java <defunct>' zombie process!?
