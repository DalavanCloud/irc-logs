[2014-09-20 01:06:20] MalekAlrwily: What is the default webdriver to use?

[2014-09-20 01:30:27] MalekAlrwily: should I use HtmlUnit or HtmlUnitDriver?
[2014-09-20 01:44:45] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 831
[2014-09-20 02:01:10] ato: WebDriver doesn't have a “default” driver implementation.
[2014-09-20 02:01:27] ato: HtmlUnitDriver is a WebDriver interface to use HtmlUnit.
[2014-09-20 02:01:44] ato: So using that will later allow you to also add more browsers using the same code.
