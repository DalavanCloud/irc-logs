[2014-09-30 06:35:44] cable: preffered linux seeing as ssh is sooo much easier on a linux machine
[2014-09-30 06:35:57] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt matter what os you run a hub on
[2014-09-30 06:36:04] cable: SSH fails instant feeling of lets go to linux (because its easier to configure)
[2014-09-30 06:36:50] cgoldberg: cable, use Linux :)  ... but what is the actual problem?  "ssh fails" isn't helpful
[2014-09-30 06:36:51] cable: im trying to achieve as following: 1 jenkins server , with vagrant test machine ( linux based boxes)  Problem with SSH (noob in ssh) know the theory but no idea about the location of the files .
[2014-09-30 06:37:09] cable: by random chance had it working (brute force)
[2014-09-30 06:37:12] WhereIsMySpoon: ssh has nothing to do with selenium
[2014-09-30 06:37:17] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-09-30 06:37:21] Mitsos101: cgoldberg: There's no problem. I just want to send commands via cURL to a remote GhostDriver, and run everything there. I wonder if it's just possible to send commands to a remote computer's GhostDriver.
[2014-09-30 06:37:24] cable: well I get to that :p
[2014-09-30 06:38:04] WhereIsMySpoon: Mitsos101: yes, that's what Grid is for
[2014-09-30 06:38:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Mitsos101: you set up a hub on one PC, this PC also has the test code. You then set up a node which has the drivers you need
[2014-09-30 06:38:38] cgoldberg: Mitsos101, can't you just use webdriver with phantomJS bindings?
[2014-09-30 06:38:42] WhereIsMySpoon: then you execute the tests, and the hub sends the tests to the nodes
[2014-09-30 06:38:48] WhereIsMySpoon: dont use phantomjs
[2014-09-30 06:39:06] cable: The optimal setup is: "Push to repository, Jenkins get a bleep that a new repository update exist. clones the repository , runs the Selenium tests (phpunit ) and after that shows you test result. "
[2014-09-30 06:39:24] cable: makes a new branch or emails about results
[2014-09-30 06:39:31] WhereIsMySpoon: that's doable
[2014-09-30 06:39:36] cgoldberg: cable, so where are you stuck?  sounds feasible
[2014-09-30 06:39:55] jimevans: Mitsos101: i think that the http server started by ghostdriver inside phantomjs limits connections to localhost. (i could very much be wrong about that)
[2014-09-30 06:40:40] cable: well... I had setup #1 windows machine  with bitbucket.org link (password in link ) what seemed annoying.  SSH link with bitbucket seemed to be annoying

[2014-09-30 06:41:37] cable: ( probably my incompetence of actually having a idea how to implement SSH)
[2014-09-30 06:41:49] joshin4colours: cable: did you configure Git on the windows machine to use HTTP or SSH?
[2014-09-30 06:41:53] cable: SSH
[2014-09-30 06:42:05] cgoldberg: cable, that's not a selenium problem.. that's a windows/ssh thing.. does windows even ship with ssh client?
[2014-09-30 06:42:14] cable: you can download git bash
[2014-09-30 06:42:15] joshin4colours: did you generate a SSH using Git Bash?
[2014-09-30 06:42:20] joshin4colours: that can be done for windows
[2014-09-30 06:42:22] cable: no I used putty plink
[2014-09-30 06:42:51] cable: but as far as SSH on windows its a nightmare for me thusfar ( wasted 1,5 days on it)
[2014-09-30 06:42:59] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-09-30 06:43:03] cable: trying to document it for future references ( because windows machines suck)

[2014-09-30 07:03:24] cgoldberg: cable, clone romote repo, and run tests locally?
[2014-09-30 07:03:46] almostwhitehat, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-30 07:04:25] cable: Yeah for example.
[2014-09-30 07:04:41] cable: I want to expand upon that but for now I have no idea how to load everything.
[2014-09-30 07:06:03] cgoldberg: cable.. fire up a shell.. git clone https://myrepo.git ... run tests
[2014-09-30 07:07:34] cable: well that defeats the purpose of continuous integration
[2014-09-30 07:07:48] cgoldberg: cable, that's not a CI setup... that's a local dev setup
[2014-09-30 07:08:05] cable: I know :) but its step one in the proces
[2014-09-30 07:08:28] cable: Thats why im opting for SSH :)
[2014-09-30 07:09:05] cable: if you got any ideas for me or input how to approach this please input! if you think im doing it wrongly
[2014-09-30 07:09:46] cgoldberg: i just don't understand what your setup is, and where SSH come in (yet).. so can't be of much help
[2014-09-30 07:11:40] cable: oh 6 - 20 developers, 1 testing machine jenkins with tests.  Everyone deploys some piece of the code saying: "this works" Jenkins evaluates it, and says: 'yes it does work!' or nay it doessnt after that It should update the branch with the working code or give input about which tests failed.

[2014-09-30 07:20:21] joshin4colours: cable: 1) see if you just add an SSH key to your bitbucket account tied to specific machines. You may not even need putty or anything else (may also need a reconfig of your Git setup)
[2014-09-30 07:21:32] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: is it lukeis who works for salesforce?
[2014-09-30 07:21:41] joshin4colours: 2) if you can, maybe instead of cloning your repos, just update a branch on them and run recent tests?

[2014-09-30 13:15:50] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: What's up?
[2014-09-30 13:16:22] AutomatedTester: so reading https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#attributes-1 (well the algorithm below)
[2014-09-30 13:17:07] lukeis: oh no.. not an attributes and properties discussion again
[2014-09-30 13:17:24] AutomatedTester: step 1 " The Capabilities object MUST be defined but MAY be empty." but in step 2 we have The local end MUST create a new Command with the "parameters" containing an entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step

[2014-09-30 13:21:04] lukeis: Caps is a type, not an actual variable
[2014-09-30 13:21:27] AutomatedTester: desiredCapabilies should be of what type? A dictionary?

[2014-09-30 13:22:11] AutomatedTester: probably object
[2014-09-30 13:22:12] lukeis: Dict then
[2014-09-30 13:22:14] lukeis: heh
[2014-09-30 13:22:25] AutomatedTester: Dictionary has "magic" around it
[2014-09-30 13:22:29] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: If I click on the word "Capabilities" it reads "capabilities of type dictionary, readonly"
[2014-09-30 13:22:31] AutomatedTester: you need to define all the keys
[2014-09-30 13:22:32] lukeis: >.>
[2014-09-30 13:22:40] lukeis: Object it is then

[2014-09-30 13:27:10] AutomatedTester: thats very weird
[2014-09-30 13:27:40] AutomatedTester: so we SHOULD use UUID but if our implementation has used this UUID before we MUST raise "session not created"
[2014-09-30 13:27:42] AutomatedTester: huh?
[2014-09-30 13:28:00] lukeis: selendroid should use that… but not as described… selendroid often has issues starting up an emulator or launching the app requested, so those should be used :)
[2014-09-30 13:28:04] jimevans: i can't think of a good use case for the local end to ever send a sessionid to the remote end upon session creation.
[2014-09-30 13:28:26] *lukeis agrees'
[2014-09-30 13:28:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I have 1 currently, but it's purely for testing Firefox
[2014-09-30 13:28:46] jimevans: enlighten me.
[2014-09-30 13:29:08] AutomatedTester: I want to do a WebRTC call, restart the browser and then load the URL and it should try carry on
[2014-09-30 13:29:30] AutomatedTester: so the profile is still the same and we need a restart
[2014-09-30 13:29:40] AutomatedTester: but this is testing browser chrome stuff

[2014-09-30 13:38:41] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: it might also be useful to get rid of desired vs required
[2014-09-30 13:38:48] AutomatedTester: and make all capabilities required
[2014-09-30 13:38:59] barancev: +1
[2014-09-30 13:39:03] nirvdrum: Yes.  But I know a certain Australian man that would lose his mind.
[2014-09-30 13:39:24] AutomatedTester: personally I cant think of any capability I would pass in that I would pass in and allow it to be ignored

[2014-09-30 13:42:35] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: From a driver implementer POV, desired capabilities don't make a ton of sense to me.  Unless the idea is the client is dumb and just blanketly asking for the same stuff from everything.
[2014-09-30 13:43:09] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the clients are supposed to be dumb
[2014-09-30 13:43:29] AutomatedTester: I think it was to help those special people asking for IE on Linux to still get a browser
[2014-09-30 13:43:39] AutomatedTester: but that is just masking the issue imho
[2014-09-30 13:43:45] nirvdrum: I fail to see how giving them Firefox instead helps anything *shrug*
[2014-09-30 13:44:13] nirvdrum: For better or worse, we have an option in grid to fail requests for desired capabilities not advertised by any of the grid nodes.

[2014-09-30 13:44:47] barancev: the most surprising effect of "desired" is when you get IE instead of Chrome :)
[2014-09-30 13:45:11] AutomatedTester: barancev: really?
[2014-09-30 13:45:29] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: raise the bug, barancev put a comment and then I will take it to the mailing lists
[2014-09-30 13:45:48] barancev: but it is a grid-related issue
[2014-09-30 13:46:09] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Without reading the entire doc right now, is it sufficient to say "Proxy config should be a required capability because XXX"?
[2014-09-30 13:46:17] barancev: interpretation of "desired" can be different for the grid and the browser
[2014-09-30 13:46:22] AutomatedTester: barancev: the Remote End is classified as any nodes
[2014-09-30 13:46:28] hirani: I am running a headless firefox browser using Xvfb on a ubuntu machine. How can I tell Selenium Server to connect and run all the tests on this headless browser? My tests are written in perl and are using perl bindings(Selenium::Remote::Driver) to communicate with Selenium Server.
[2014-09-30 13:46:32] AutomatedTester: barancev: local end is the client code
[2014-09-30 13:46:39] nirvdrum: barancev: You can configure the grid to require a direct capability match.  Everyone I know using grid does that :-P
[2014-09-30 13:46:57] barancev: nirvdrum: me too. but the default is not
[2014-09-30 13:47:25] nirvdrum: hirani: Start the selenium server process setting DISPLAY to whatever Xvfb is using.  Then have your clients connect to that Selenium Server instance.
[2014-09-30 13:47:44] nirvdrum: barancev: Yeah, I think that was mostly political.  To match what non-grid does.

[2014-09-30 13:48:46] barancev: let's think another case -- native events -- should this capability be required or desired?
[2014-09-30 13:49:10] nirvdrum: I think all capabilities should be required.
[2014-09-30 13:49:24] nirvdrum: Next question :-)

[2014-09-30 13:50:20] nirvdrum: barancev: Basically if there's an exceptionable circumstance, I think the caller should handle it.  The callee shouldn't transparently try to reconcile the issue for the caller, IMHO.
[2014-09-30 13:51:28] barancev: ok, then, should nodes report to the hub information about ability to driver browsers with native events and with synthesized events separately?
[2014-09-30 13:51:50] barancev: so that the hub can dispatch requests to an appropriate node?
[2014-09-30 13:52:00] mbusby2, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-09-30 13:53:16] barancev: that implies, that a node should know what firefox version is available and whether is supports native events or not
[2014-09-30 13:53:18] jimevans: barancev: the distinction of "native events" or not is rapidly going to become obsolete
[2014-09-30 13:54:20] jimevans: this is already the case for chromedriver, and for the MSFT IE driver implementation.
[2014-09-30 13:54:41] jimevans: setting the capability has no effect in those two cases.
[2014-09-30 13:54:54] nirvdrum: barancev: Sure.  Again, everyone grid I know of, the nodes register back the version and the OS.
[2014-09-30 13:54:57] jimevans: it doesn't have any effect for marionette either.
[2014-09-30 13:55:01] jimevans: afaik

[2014-09-30 14:09:30] hirani: nirvdrum: [headless browser]. So just setting the env. variable DISPLAY to appropriate value and then starting up the selenium server should suffice ? or the selenium server takes argument called DISPLAY  ?
