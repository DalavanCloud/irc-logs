[2014-09-05 01:32:23] Relequestual: Hi All! I'm using Behat and trying out some basic things, but I'm getting an error: [XPATH
[2014-09-05 01:32:33] Relequestual: ] is either invalid or does not result in a WebElement. The following error occurred: InvalidSelectorError
[2014-09-05 01:32:53] Relequestual: but it doesn't tell me where in the xpath the error is
[2014-09-05 01:32:56] Relequestual: any suggestions?
[2014-09-05 01:33:12] jimevans: Relequestual: seems pretty self-explanatory. what's the xpath?
[2014-09-05 01:33:47] Relequestual: jimevans yeah I thought so, but it's mink which is generating the xpath...
[2014-09-05 01:33:49] Relequestual: /html/.//*[self::input | self::textarea | self::select][not(./@type = 'submit' or ./@type = 'image' or ./@type = 'hidden')][(((./@id = Search Drupal or ./@name = Search Drupal) or ./@id = //label[contains(normalize-space(string(.)), Search Drupal)]/@for) or ./@placeholder = Search Drupal)] | .//label[contains(normalize-space(string(.)), Search Drupal)]//.//*[self::input | self::textarea | self::select][not(./@type = 'submit' or

[2014-09-05 01:35:08] jimevans: oh dear $deity! that's horrific
[2014-09-05 01:35:49] jimevans: but all of your "Search Drupal" pieces should probably be surrounded by single quotes.
[2014-09-05 01:37:52] Relequestual: my code is...
[2014-09-05 01:37:52] Relequestual: $page->find('named', array('field', 'Search Drupal'));
[2014-09-05 01:38:02] Relequestual: I guess I can try adding quotes inside the quotes
[2014-09-05 01:38:14] jimevans: i'm not being clear.
[2014-09-05 01:38:45] qwertyfa`, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-09-05 01:39:07] jimevans: for example, you have "./@id = Search Drupal". unless "Search Drupal" is surrounded by single quotes, that's not going to be proper xpath.
[2014-09-05 01:39:40] Relequestual: right. yeah I'm with you
[2014-09-05 01:41:12] barancev: No More RC!
[2014-09-05 01:43:19] Relequestual: thanks jimevans ! My tests are failing but I'm not getting that error anymore =]
[2014-09-05 01:43:32] barancev: jimevans: thanks for the new driver integration!
[2014-09-05 01:43:33] jimevans: np
[2014-09-05 01:43:47] jimevans: barancev: my pleasure
[2014-09-05 01:44:24] jimevans: it's a grossly incomplete implementation, but that's mostly because the spec is incomplete.
[2014-09-05 01:44:43] jimevans: and i need to update the prebuilts.
[2014-09-05 01:45:05] barancev: at least we can track it now by running our test set

[2014-09-05 09:36:47] niadh: Hi all, I have a small test suite using selenium that I'm developing at work, but it's suddenly stopped working as it did (there has been a firefox update, I'm tempted, but not certain they are related) the browser appears but does nothing and the whole program crashes when for some reason it couldn't load a profile. The test suite is written in python.
