[2014-09-08 02:18:50] hefest: hey guys. is it possible to run headless selenium automated tests written in java with eclipse?
[2014-09-08 02:20:13] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: yes
[2014-09-08 02:20:20] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: look up phantomjs
[2014-09-08 02:20:24] WhereIsMySpoon: however, I don't recommend doing it
[2014-09-08 02:20:45] hefest: why?
[2014-09-08 02:20:56] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: how many of your end users browse your site with a headless client?
[2014-09-08 02:21:02] barancev: or run browsers on linux using xvfb
[2014-09-08 02:21:20] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: not always an option
[2014-09-08 02:21:29] hefest: you mean you are not recommending running selenium on linux?
[2014-09-08 02:21:36] WhereIsMySpoon: that isn't what I said
[2014-09-08 02:21:53] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: phantomjs, although it works for the most part is a) not a proper browser and b) uses a very old javascript engine
[2014-09-08 02:22:06] WhereIsMySpoon: the point of using selenium for browser testing is for E2E testing
[2014-09-08 02:22:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i.e. like a user browses
[2014-09-08 02:22:24] WhereIsMySpoon: kinda defeats the point if you aren't testing with a real user env
[2014-09-08 02:22:47] WhereIsMySpoon: it also requires a few extra tricks in some selenium code to get it working (e.g. alerts aren't handled the same way)
[2014-09-08 02:23:03] WhereIsMySpoon: I tried it, didn't like
[2014-09-08 02:23:04] barancev: phantomjs uses a modern JS engine, but it is not the same engine as used in the "real" browsers
[2014-09-08 02:23:34] WhereIsMySpoon: Ah right, sorry for that mistake :)
[2014-09-08 02:23:42] hefest: ok, so running automated tests in full linux gui env is then ok?
[2014-09-08 02:23:44] WhereIsMySpoon: All in all, I recommend against doing headless testing
[2014-09-08 02:23:47] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: sure
[2014-09-08 02:23:56] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: as long as you don't need to test IE :)
[2014-09-08 02:23:58] hefest: i dont see how xvfb is different from that?
[2014-09-08 02:24:26] barancev: phantomjs' engine it is not "an old version of V8", it is just different (that's even worse)
[2014-09-08 02:24:42] WhereIsMySpoon: right, thanks :)
[2014-09-08 02:24:47] barancev: under xvfb you can run a real browser. but only on a linux platform. no IE, no Safari
[2014-09-08 02:25:14] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: xvfb allows you to do that without needing graphical drivers etc
[2014-09-08 02:25:24] hefest: so how do you feed the java eclipse written tests to the selenium webdriver for automated testing?
[2014-09-08 02:26:08] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: you mean to automatically run the tests?
[2014-09-08 02:26:09] hefest: or do i have to run eclipse on linux server together with selenium webdriver too?
[2014-09-08 02:26:12] hefest: WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2014-09-08 02:26:21] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: I recommend integrating with jenkins for example
[2014-09-08 02:26:33] WhereIsMySpoon: alternatively, just set a cron to run the tests
[2014-09-08 02:26:38] WhereIsMySpoon: with plain java
[2014-09-08 02:27:04] hefest: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, that's what im interested in for the start
[2014-09-08 02:27:06] barancev: or you can run tests remotely using selenium server
[2014-09-08 02:27:24] WhereIsMySpoon: as to the how to do that, I'm not sure, haven't done it yet
[2014-09-08 02:27:36] hefest: im planning on running hub with for now only linux machine as a node but probably adding windows one too
[2014-09-08 02:27:39] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev can likely help you if you have q's to that, if he feels up to it :)
[2014-09-08 02:28:28] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: I recommend googling the jenkins plugin for selenium first
[2014-09-08 02:28:41] barancev: don't!
[2014-09-08 02:28:43] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to do that
[2014-09-08 02:28:54] WhereIsMySpoon: if not, just google for the selenium hub and setup
[2014-09-08 02:29:05] WhereIsMySpoon: to setup the hub is quite easy iirc
[2014-09-08 02:29:06] barancev: the jenkins plugin uses out of date selenium version
[2014-09-08 02:29:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ow ok
[2014-09-08 02:29:11] WhereIsMySpoon: then dont do that
[2014-09-08 02:29:13] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-09-08 02:29:18] barancev: don't use it unless it is upgraded
[2014-09-08 02:29:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-09-08 02:30:31] hefest: the thing is these tests are written in eclipse and tested there
[2014-09-08 02:31:06] barancev: or may be I'm wrong...
[2014-09-08 02:31:29] WhereIsMySpoon: hefest: ok? they're still just java
[2014-09-08 02:31:30] barancev: sorry they released a version 2.4.1 with selenium 2.41
[2014-09-08 02:32:08] selbot2__: 04 Open issues: 824
[2014-09-08 02:32:30] barancev: suport for 2.41 is not mentioned in the changelog, but according to the github it is integrated just before the release -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/selenium-plugin/commits/master
[2014-09-08 02:33:45] barancev: nevertheless, start without jenkins, infrastructure complexity is not what you need on the early stages of test development
[2014-09-08 02:34:29] WhereIsMySpoon: ya true
[2014-09-08 02:34:51] hefest: WhereIsMySpoon: there are some coding specifics to running tests in eclipse vs standalone
[2014-09-08 02:35:05] WhereIsMySpoon: I doubt it
[2014-09-08 02:35:16] WhereIsMySpoon: There may be some specifics to starting/building the tests
[2014-09-08 02:35:20] WhereIsMySpoon: But not to coding them
[2014-09-08 02:35:33] hefest: barancev: yes, im going to run it from cron probably for start

[2014-09-08 03:34:21] laddo: i run many test scripts on a single computer which vary in length and may run for many hours
[2014-09-08 03:34:52] laddo: is it possible to split a test script and distribute it to multiple computers?
[2014-09-08 03:35:22] laddo: so say i have a script that contains 10 test of 1 min each, it would take 10 mins to finish.
[2014-09-08 03:35:45] laddo: can i splt the script and distribute to 10 computers so that it would only take 1 min to run?

[2014-09-08 03:55:08] barancev: it depends on what "a script" is and what's your testing framework ability to parallel test execution
[2014-09-08 03:55:38] laddo: i make a test script on selenium of multiple tests
[2014-09-08 03:55:49] laddo: so that i can set it going and it runs all my tests
[2014-09-08 03:55:57] barancev: "a script" is too value a word
[2014-09-08 03:56:05] laddo: im not sure if im using the correct terminology so i hope that makes sense

[2014-09-08 03:56:48] barancev: well, what plrogramming language do you use? what's the testing framework?
[2014-09-08 03:57:32] laddo: i use selenium ide and use that to generate the test case
[2014-09-08 03:57:55] laddo: and would be using virtual machines on the cloud
[2014-09-08 03:57:56] barancev: then, you have to split it and distribute manually
[2014-09-08 03:58:26] laddo: would it be possible if i wrote them manually?
[2014-09-08 03:59:18] laddo: i am able to make any changes to the way i work, so if theres ia a solution then i can implement that
[2014-09-08 03:59:21] barancev: it depends on what programming language you use, what a testing framework is, and the architecture of the test suite

[2014-09-08 03:59:40] WhereIsMySpoon: there is no programming language
[2014-09-08 03:59:49] laddo: i can stop using the ide if that is what is needed
[2014-09-08 03:59:51] WhereIsMySpoon: unless you count xml as a programming language

[2014-09-08 04:06:04] laddo: ok :)
[2014-09-08 04:07:05] laddo: so i do a lot of load testing and functional testing
[2014-09-08 04:07:19] laddo: hmm no ignore that, its not relevant
[2014-09-08 04:07:49] laddo: functional testing is what i had in mind. so as an example, i might be testing a clients website
[2014-09-08 04:08:06] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is not useful for load testing really
[2014-09-08 04:08:10] WhereIsMySpoon: its for functional testing
[2014-09-08 04:08:14] laddo: log in, create user, edit details

[2014-09-08 04:08:50] laddo: i wanted to split those over several nodes rather than run it on one node
[2014-09-08 04:09:09] WhereIsMySpoon: I doubt that it would be very stable to run 1000/10,000/whatever instances of chrome/chromedriver and run them all
[2014-09-08 04:09:17] WhereIsMySpoon: laddo: perfectly possible
[2014-09-08 04:09:21] WhereIsMySpoon: laddo: look up selenium grid
[2014-09-08 04:09:39] artyname, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-09-08 04:09:44] laddo: ah yes, i briefly read about this
[2014-09-08 04:09:50] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: with htmlunit or with a good grid it is possible
[2014-09-08 04:10:14] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: I meant with the normal running of a browser
[2014-09-08 04:10:27] barancev: on a grid, yes
[2014-09-08 04:11:07] WhereIsMySpoon: hmn ok
[2014-09-08 04:11:18] WhereIsMySpoon: anyhow, grid is good :)
[2014-09-08 04:11:42] laddo: thank you :)
[2014-09-08 04:11:51] laddo: can the nodes be vm's?
[2014-09-08 04:12:03] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd assume so
[2014-09-08 04:12:12] WhereIsMySpoon: you'd need to forward the relevant ports etc ofc
[2014-09-08 04:12:19] laddo: yeah
[2014-09-08 04:12:20] WhereIsMySpoon: so that the grid server can reach them
[2014-09-08 04:12:30] laddo: i can write a script for that

[2014-09-08 06:17:39] antsanto: Hi barancev . I have a quick question.
[2014-09-08 06:17:58] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is the library/framework used to write tests. you then need to use another framework to run/organise your testing
[2014-09-08 06:18:11] barancev: you use a tool to run the tests, and in the tests you use selenium library to access a browser

[2014-09-08 06:21:58] barancev: a typical test automation toolchain consist of (top to down): CI server (e.g. jenkins), a project builder (e.g. maven), a testing framework (e.g. junit), a test suite (that's what you develop), a library to access the interface of the system under test (e.g. selenium, for web interfaces), and the system under tests

[2014-09-08 08:17:00] gp5st: WhereIsMySpoon yuppers
[2014-09-08 08:17:20] gp5st: WhereIsMySpoon have you tried the spoon drawer btw?
[2014-09-08 08:17:26] WhereIsMySpoon: gp5st: usually those appear either when you start typing or when you left click the <input>
[2014-09-08 08:17:52] WhereIsMySpoon: so click the element/start typing, then check for existance of something you expect

[2014-09-08 08:21:48] smccarthy: gp5st: I dont know if you can access the box, since I dont think its in the DOM
[2014-09-08 08:22:13] smccarthy: gp5st: maybe you can use the Actions class to click right below the input field ?
[2014-09-08 08:22:16] gp5st: smccarthy: that's what I told my uppers but I just wanted to double check
[2014-09-08 08:22:55] smccarthy: gp5st: I am interested if anyone else has a good way though (if possible)
[2014-09-08 08:27:05] WhereIsMySpoon: the one that google uses is in the dom
[2014-09-08 08:27:32] gp5st: WhereIsMySpoon up it is. but that's not what i'm talking about
[2014-09-08 08:28:07] WhereIsMySpoon: gp5st: can you give me an example of a website that uses the one you're talking about?
[2014-09-08 08:28:24] gp5st: smccarthy: maybe I should be less creative and just look for autocomplete="off" on the element?
[2014-09-08 08:28:38] gp5st: since I just want to check if the box isn't there

[2014-09-08 08:33:11] gp5st: it's not something a site can do
[2014-09-08 08:33:15] gp5st: it's built into a browser

[2014-09-08 08:33:26] antsanto: Hi people how are u achieving file upload in safari?
[2014-09-08 08:33:39] antsanto: sendkeys of file path not working!
[2014-09-08 08:33:48] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: please provide the selenium code + html
[2014-09-08 08:34:39] WhereIsMySpoon: gp5st: but there must be a website somewhere that uses this browser specific autofill?
[2014-09-08 08:34:55] gp5st: WhereIsMySpoon everyone with an input box?
[2014-09-08 08:35:04] gp5st: it's not something a website has control over
[2014-09-08 08:35:15] antsanto: the html code is simple <input type=file id=test>
[2014-09-08 08:35:20] WhereIsMySpoon: Oh, I think I see what you mean
[2014-09-08 08:36:01] antsanto: and java code is driver.findElement(By.id(test)).sendKeys(/path))
[2014-09-08 08:36:02] antsanto: just a small snippet. nothing is happening :(
[2014-09-08 08:36:40] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: you need to send an absolute path
[2014-09-08 08:37:12] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: for example, I do driver.findElement(By.id("test")).sendKeys(new File(myFilePath).getAbsolutePath())

[2014-09-08 08:37:48] antsanto: Is the whole safari people face this problem? or only me?
[2014-09-08 08:38:00] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: are you sure that the filepath you're sending is correct?
[2014-09-08 08:38:15] WhereIsMySpoon: I.e. if you make a very small java class that does File f = new File(yourFilePath); this doesnt throw an exception?
[2014-09-08 08:38:36] antsanto: Yes. its correct. No exception!
[2014-09-08 08:39:16] gp5st: antsanto: what's being POSTed?
[2014-09-08 08:39:31] WhereIsMySpoon: with the limited code and html you've sent me, I can't see anything wrong, but you might have something else that is going wrong either before or after what you've posted
[2014-09-08 08:39:32] gp5st: better question: how do you know your file isn't being uploaded
[2014-09-08 08:39:50] WhereIsMySpoon: It would be great if you could actually provide the -entire- html and -entire- selenium code with the error message you're getting
[2014-09-08 08:40:12] andrzej, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-08 08:40:14] gp5st: antsanto: what's your enctype for the form? and is this happening in other browsers?

[2014-09-08 08:41:16] antsanto: Other browsers its working. For example FireFox
[2014-09-08 08:41:33] WhereIsMySpoon: and chrome and ie?
[2014-09-08 08:42:00] antsanto: Chrome too works. Only Safri being a crime here
[2014-09-08 08:42:04] antsanto: ie didn't try
[2014-09-08 08:42:07] WhereIsMySpoon: ok thats fine
[2014-09-08 08:42:15] WhereIsMySpoon: safari is webkit too
[2014-09-08 08:42:28] antsanto: now we r currently doing file upload using applescript

[2014-09-08 08:43:06] jusmyth, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-08 08:43:22] antsanto: What I guess is, since safari driver is an js implementation, js can't upload it
[2014-09-08 08:43:35] antsanto: since js cant change the value of file html type
[2014-09-08 08:44:12] antsanto: Me planning to raise it as a bug tomorrow.

[2014-09-08 08:45:45] WhereIsMySpoon: it exists already
[2014-09-08 08:46:13] WhereIsMySpoon: marked as wontfix
[2014-09-08 08:47:38] antsanto: Thats my bad!!! Only apple script can save me
[2014-09-08 08:47:45] WhereIsMySpoon: yep, or autoit
[2014-09-08 08:47:52] WhereIsMySpoon: unfortunate :)
[2014-09-08 08:48:25] antsanto: Yes . I'm thinking to give as a fix. Are you aware of services in mac?
[2014-09-08 08:48:39] WhereIsMySpoon: nope, I know nothinig about macs really
[2014-09-08 08:49:11] antsanto: We can have the apple script as service and safari can call it to get uploaded. But the problem is parallel execution cant happen
[2014-09-08 08:49:17] OscarRieken: I don't test file upload I don't see the point
[2014-09-08 08:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: OscarRieken: it might be part of a bigger functionality that then does something with it
[2014-09-08 08:50:49] WhereIsMySpoon: for example you upload and it then parses the file server side and displays parts of it in some way on the screen
[2014-09-08 08:51:03] WhereIsMySpoon: and you want to test that you get to that display state correctly
[2014-09-08 08:52:50] OscarRieken: right but that would just be a post from the form to an api, I would test that, not how html spec works
[2014-09-08 08:53:56] WhereIsMySpoon: OscarRieken: sure, but the easiest way to do that is to just send the file to the input element
[2014-09-08 08:54:42] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise you need to build up the request manually in your test code
[2014-09-08 08:54:50] WhereIsMySpoon: which is a fair bit more effort
[2014-09-08 08:55:00] WhereIsMySpoon: at least with java it is
[2014-09-08 08:55:44] WhereIsMySpoon: though I have done that with file downloads ^^ means I dont need to interact with files at all, just see what the header response is
[2014-09-08 08:56:29] elstif, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-08 08:56:47] OscarRieken: I guess it depends on how your app, testing framework, and tests are written
[2014-09-08 08:57:03] WhereIsMySpoon: my test framework is completely independent of my app
[2014-09-08 08:57:15] WhereIsMySpoon: for selenium tests that is
[2014-09-08 08:57:25] WhereIsMySpoon: obviously for unit tests it isnt

[2014-09-08 21:57:40] eliza411: On my desktop selenium server in standalone mode prints "Started SocketListener on 0.0.0.0:4444" but on my server with almost exactly the same configuration it doesn't try to start the SocketListener at all. Port 4444 is free and starting with -mode hub will bind to it. Any idea what I should check next?
[2014-09-08 21:58:26] eliza411: I don't want to run it as a grid in this case. I'd like it to be standalone like on the desktop.
