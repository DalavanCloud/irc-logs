[2014-09-22 03:58:56] jarib: no
[2014-09-22 03:59:00] jarib: that's correct
[2014-09-22 03:59:11] jarib: Element#sendKeys is different from the #sendKeys action

[2014-09-22 03:59:46] barancev: right, that's why I expected shift to be released as soon as I switched to use element#sendKeys

[2014-09-22 04:01:00] WhereIsMySpoon: "Element#sendKeys is different from the #sendKeys action" - this sounds really confusing
[2014-09-22 04:01:06] barancev: "Modifier keys are preserved throughout the lifetime of the send keys operation, and are released upon this method returning."
[2014-09-22 04:01:40] barancev: javadoc is wrong, yea?
[2014-09-22 04:01:40] jarib: WhereIsMySpoon: i mean Element.sendKeys is different from Actions.sendKeys - two seperate methods, and the difference is documented
[2014-09-22 04:02:32] WhereIsMySpoon: jarib: ah ok right
[2014-09-22 04:03:38] jarib: barancev: yeah, that sounds wrong (but correct for WebElement.sendKeys)
[2014-09-22 04:03:53] jarib: also, i thought Keyboard was totally internal
[2014-09-22 04:04:00] jarib: i.e. the user is never exposed to it
[2014-09-22 04:04:19] barancev: Actions.sendKeys is correct too "The modifier keys included in this call are not released."
[2014-09-22 04:04:54] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: that sounds familiar
[2014-09-22 04:04:56] jarib: right. is this not consistent with the spec?
[2014-09-22 04:04:58] barancev: but... I expected it to be released at the moment I swiched back to "do what I assume" methods
[2014-09-22 04:05:18] jarib: so you expecte WebElement.sendKeys to release everyting before typing
[2014-09-22 04:05:23] barancev: right
[2014-09-22 04:06:04] jarib: i guess that's up for debate
[2014-09-22 04:06:10] WhereIsMySpoon: jarib: I'd expect Actions.perform() to release after it's finished tbh
[2014-09-22 04:06:52] WhereIsMySpoon: that way the state is back to the way it was before any Action was performed
[2014-09-22 04:07:01] jarib: WhereIsMySpoon: actions are "do as i say" - it won't release unless you're explicit
[2014-09-22 04:07:17] jarib: WhereIsMySpoon: WebElement.sendKeys is "do what i want"
[2014-09-22 04:07:31] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, but after you're finished with all Actions it should revert to the state it was before any Action was performed
[2014-09-22 04:07:45] WhereIsMySpoon: imo
[2014-09-22 04:08:00] jarib: right, that's not how it works
[2014-09-22 04:08:07] WhereIsMySpoon: I can see that
[2014-09-22 04:08:25] WhereIsMySpoon: I think it makes more sense to do this, than to have WebElement.sendKeys release all modifier keys before starting
[2014-09-22 04:09:28] amikiri, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-22 04:10:05] WhereIsMySpoon: I think that having a set of Actions performed polluting the state of the driver is...weird
[2014-09-22 04:10:15] jarib: let's say you want your test to press shift, then make an API call to the backend, then verify the result in the UI, then release the key
[2014-09-22 04:10:26] jarib: that's possible now, but wouldn't be with your suggestion
[2014-09-22 04:10:26] WhereIsMySpoon: a set of Actions should be self-contained
[2014-09-22 04:10:38] WhereIsMySpoon: why would you want to release shift after you verify?
[2014-09-22 04:10:56] jarib: perhaps the result is different when the user holds down the key?
[2014-09-22 04:11:25] jarib: or it goes away as soon as the key is released
[2014-09-22 04:11:31] jarib: i mean, we can't make these assumptions
[2014-09-22 04:12:00] jarib: unless you allow injecting arbitrary code into Actions, the current implementation makes a lot of sense to me
[2014-09-22 04:12:15] WhereIsMySpoon: jarib: then I propose that having it release all modifier keys is the default behaviour, and to have a method added to Actions that is something like "keepModifierState"
[2014-09-22 04:12:37] WhereIsMySpoon: or have it as a param passed to perform(0
[2014-09-22 04:12:39] WhereIsMySpoon: ()*
[2014-09-22 04:13:22] WhereIsMySpoon: so you could do Actions a = new Actions(); a.blah().foo().keepModifierState().perform() or a.blah().foo().perform(true);

[2014-09-22 04:13:51] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: a classical case is "1) some action, 2) wait an element to be visible, 3) some other action"
[2014-09-22 04:14:34] WhereIsMySpoon: tbh, all I've used Actions for is to navigate pop up menus
[2014-09-22 04:14:41] barancev: move  mouse over an element with CONTROL pressed, wait another element to appear, drag-n-drop to it

[2014-09-22 04:15:05] barancev: or popum menues, yes, but the lazy ones :)
[2014-09-22 04:15:22] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: sure, that would still be possible with my solution
[2014-09-22 04:15:34] WhereIsMySpoon: I just think that the default behaviour of it polluting the existing environment is bad
[2014-09-22 04:16:20] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: as soon as you release CONTROL another element disappears :)
[2014-09-22 04:16:41] jarib: keepModifierState is just added complexity IMO. better to make the user aware that you have to be explicit with Actions

[2014-09-22 04:17:54] WhereIsMySpoon: oh fucks sake
[2014-09-22 04:17:55] barancev: we want sticky behavior, it is a Good Thing, but the Actions magic should stop as soon as I reverted to regular element#clicks and sendKeys

[2014-09-22 04:18:56] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: I'd be behind Element#sendKeys releasing all currently pressed modifier keys before doing anything else, if my solution isn't acceptable

Can anyone offer any insight on the following problem? A single selenium script performs a .get() on https://server1.com 5 times and pulls a meta tag which has a timestamp. The timestamp increments successfully each time. Then the script, without shutting down, repeats the previous procedure for the same exact site, but hosted o
[2014-09-22 10:07:35] KaibutsuX: n https://server2.com and the timestamps do NOT imcrement. They are all the same. Is it possible something in firefox is not caching pages from server1, but it is caching for server2?

[2014-09-22 10:08:31] dimacus: are you using some sort of a load balancer or a caching proxy on servers?
[2014-09-22 10:08:46] dimacus: are all the assets on server 1 and 2 hosted on a cdn?
[2014-09-22 10:09:20] KaibutsuX: I am using memcache, but disabling it seems to have no effect. Each server hosts it's own resources locally
[2014-09-22 10:10:16] dimacus: what happens if you repeat it but use plane old curl or wget?
[2014-09-22 10:11:13] KaibutsuX: I can't reproduce in curl, because the url I'm hitting actually creates a logged-in session
[2014-09-22 10:11:43] dimacus: also, when you doing teh 5 time hits, do you get a new profile each time in firefox or do you re-use the same session?
[2014-09-22 10:11:52] KaibutsuX: same session
[2014-09-22 10:12:35] KaibutsuX: what I'm doing boils down to: 1) hit url, 2) hit url with login_credentials, 3) hit url with logout command, 4) hit url

[2014-09-22 10:15:18] dimacus: i might be wrong, but that honestly sounds like browser cachingâ€¦ somewhere the browser recognizes that the assets it's getting have the same cache IDs and does some lazy loading
[2014-09-22 10:15:25] dimacus: (this is 1/2 baked theory)
[2014-09-22 10:15:38] dimacus: but you can test it by doing a browser.quit and getting a new session each time
[2014-09-22 10:15:46] KaibutsuX: yes, I can try that
[2014-09-22 10:15:50] dimacus: also, your company can have a local caching server in the network
[2014-09-22 10:15:58] KaibutsuX: we do not

[2014-09-22 10:16:30] dimacus: how about the ISP? could the ISP be caching extrnal calls or the servers are local also?
[2014-09-22 10:16:44] KaibutsuX: they are all local
[2014-09-22 10:17:14] dimacus: ok so far the only theory i got left over is to try to quit the browser each time

[2014-09-22 10:21:15] KaibutsuX: I'm not aware of any selenium level commands where I can set cache preferences in the driver
[2014-09-22 10:21:26] dimacus: it feels like some weird unintended session sharing between server 1 and 2, but i can't prove it
[2014-09-22 10:21:33] dimacus: well
