[2014-09-18 00:21:54] VaticanCameos: Hello all, I am new to Selenium testing. I wish to test the drop down menu links on this webpage: https://www.lie-nielsen.com/ which appear at the top. For example: all links in the Hand Tools menu and the Hand Tools link itself, and so on for the other drop down menus. Ideally, how would I go about this task? They are all hyperlinks: finding by tag name "a" would fetch all possible links..
[2014-09-18 00:23:52] VaticanCameos: Somehow I think there is going to be an application of two loops, one to loop through all drop down menus and one to go through each menu item...

[2014-09-18 02:42:44] WhereIsMySpoon: operatiay: https://code.google.com/p/silverlight-selenium/
[2014-09-18 02:42:58] WhereIsMySpoon: dont know anything about it but it looks useful
[2014-09-18 02:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: really you should be moving away from silverlight
[2014-09-18 02:43:36] operatiay: :) thank you. this one is more about automating silverlight rather than enabling the plugin...
[2014-09-18 02:43:57] operatiay: and the decision to move away from Silverlight is not my call, unfortunately...
[2014-09-18 02:43:58] i5513: I was thinking selenium people prefer people using webdriver than RC server, but seems like it is more complete the export to RC server style scripts

[2014-09-18 02:46:41] operatiay: @WhereIsMySpoon: the stackoverflow is about clicking on a plugin icon within the browser... I was looking for an option to avoid those checks for a newly created profile. I've managed to disable it for my profile and it's fine when I use it while running the test.
[2014-09-18 02:47:10] operatiay: so I wanted to set this same option in java code
[2014-09-18 02:47:48] operatiay: but I am not familiar with the ways FirefoxProfile is working or where to look for this persisted option to somehow set it then from the code...
[2014-09-18 02:48:21] i5513: At http://www.seleniumhq.org/ not mention to selenium builder
[2014-09-18 02:48:23] barancev: operatiay: plugins should be on by default
[2014-09-18 02:48:48] barancev: plugins are shared among profiles
[2014-09-18 02:49:34] operatiay: ah, ok. so if I disable the check for a plugin from one profile it's valid for all the profiles. thank you. I think it's sufficient for my purposes :)

[2014-09-18 08:10:14] dimacus: when using IE9, and you have a high rez screen the default zoom level for IE is 125% to 150% which makes IE not work… the MS solution on their help page is to do a reg edit fix… that's high quality user interface

[2014-09-18 08:39:44] dimacus: pauldespre: so best i can tell from your stack trace is that you are trying to interact with some object in JS that is not defined

[2014-09-18 08:42:30] coreyg: pauldespre: does the field transform onFocus in the JS (i.e. new attributes, etc)?
[2014-09-18 08:43:45] pauldespre: dimacus: it worked before, and works on other machine..
[2014-09-18 08:43:53] pauldespre: coreyg: i'm not sure
[2014-09-18 08:44:16] dimacus: so it's possible that you have a JS transition happening but the test is not waiting long enough
[2014-09-18 08:44:32] dimacus: the simplest way to test it, is to add a sleep of 20 seconds before the click and see if that fixed it
[2014-09-18 08:44:47] dimacus: if it did, we can show you how to make a smart ajax/animation wait
[2014-09-18 08:45:32] pauldespre: ok, I will put a wait
[2014-09-18 08:47:26] pauldespre: on the machine were it didn't work, I have selenium 2.43. On my machine I have 2.42.1
[2014-09-18 08:47:30] pauldespre: does this matter?
[2014-09-18 08:47:39] pauldespre: same phantomjs version
[2014-09-18 08:47:53] dimacus: it shouldn't matter but also a likely candidate
[2014-09-18 08:48:14] dimacus: there were a couple of major bugs on 2.42.0 that made grid nodes not work… so who knows

[2014-09-18 10:16:13] barancev: it's not about rewriting, it's about design
[2014-09-18 10:16:30] barancev: do we want to allow typing into invisible file fields

[2014-09-18 10:16:51] ato: barancev: No.
[2014-09-18 10:17:04] barancev: ato: why?
[2014-09-18 10:17:12] ato: Because the user can't see them.

[2014-09-18 10:20:43] barancev: atm, the only way to deal with file inputs like http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/upload/index is executeScript to reset visibility attributes of the field (yes, it breaks the page layout sometimes), and then type into it
[2014-09-18 10:21:38] barancev: if you click a visible button-placeholder (as a user does) -- you get a native file selection dialogue and test execution stops

[2014-09-18 10:21:54] barancev: that's why we need a workaround for this case
[2014-09-18 10:21:55] Silne30, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-18 10:22:01] ato: In that case the input type=file element isn't interactable.
[2014-09-18 10:22:20] barancev: it is not *directly* interactable
[2014-09-18 10:22:23] ato: There's custom elements on top of it that are interactable that triggers via JS the behaviour of the input type=file.
[2014-09-18 10:22:34] ato: Right.
[2014-09-18 10:22:48] barancev: correct. but what would you suggest to fill this hidden field?
[2014-09-18 10:22:59] barancev: a user can do this
[2014-09-18 10:23:00] ato: It would be nice if we could support this use case somehow though.
[2014-09-18 10:23:23] barancev: it is an exclusion from the rule
[2014-09-18 10:23:37] ato: Basically we'd need a way to tell sendKeys that what he's typing into (the ultimate goal) is a file field.
[2014-09-18 10:23:44] barancev: because native dialogue
[2014-09-18 10:24:04] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2014-09-18 10:24:08] ato: Yeah, and the driver needs to apply some special magic to prevent the native dialogue from appearing, so it needs to know that it's a file field.
[2014-09-18 10:24:44] barancev: right. actual user types into the native dialog. we suppress it. bump!
[2014-09-18 10:24:44] ato: I suspect we can't deduce that it's a file field, but maybe we could have an event attached to the file field.
[2014-09-18 10:25:14] ato: So instead of checking for element.tagName == "input" and attribute type == "file", we'd check for some event to be triggered.

[2014-09-18 10:25:31] jimevans: why wouldn't checking for those work?
[2014-09-18 10:25:47] ato: Because the actual file field is being wrapped in other elements.
[2014-09-18 10:25:58] ato: Which triggers the behaviour of input type=file only through JS apparently.
[2014-09-18 10:26:15] ato: So what we see on the screen isn't the file field the user is interacting with.
[2014-09-18 10:26:21] jimevans: and the javascript pops up a file dialog?
[2014-09-18 10:26:26] ato: Apparently.
[2014-09-18 10:26:30] ato: I didn't look too closely.
[2014-09-18 10:26:35] jimevans: meh. that's a horrible ux.
[2014-09-18 10:26:44] ato: Well I can see the use case.

[2014-09-18 10:27:33] jimevans: well, i can see the use case too, but the "right" thing to do is to let the developer be able to initiate the file upload silently.
[2014-09-18 10:27:43] jimevans: (though that's a massive security issue)
[2014-09-18 10:27:58] ato: See for example https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Tools_and_frameworks/Web_components
[2014-09-18 10:28:31] ato: Or I speak maybe too soon.

[2014-09-18 10:54:02] jimevans: that's been my excuse for not implementing it in .NET, that the reference implementation (java) isn't solidified.

[2014-09-18 10:59:37] simonstewart: Have you tried a global substitution and see what shatters into a million pieces/
[2014-09-18 10:59:39] lukeis: i've been able to force quite a few things to it… because alert handling and cross domain stuff… but otherwise there's a lot of old stuff
[2014-09-18 10:59:51] lukeis: lots and lots of things
[2014-09-18 10:59:59] simonstewart: I’m impressed.
[2014-09-18 11:00:08] simonstewart: Are they fixable in the emulation layer?
[2014-09-18 11:00:36] jimevans: simonstewart: inertia. > 100 dev teams, all of whom will scream bloody murder if any of their precious tests that "haven't failed in forever" starts falling over.
[2014-09-18 11:00:40] lukeis: it has to do how they extend every test with a DefaultSelenium looking base class :'(
[2014-09-18 11:00:58] simonstewart: I’d love to see this at some point
[2014-09-18 11:01:06] barancev: simonstewart: I don't think we need WDBS in 3.0 at all
[2014-09-18 11:01:17] lukeis: simonstewart:  end of next month? :)
[2014-09-18 11:01:29] jimevans: indeed.
[2014-09-18 11:01:31] barancev: if one wants RC os WDBS -- legacy package is available
[2014-09-18 11:01:47] simonstewart: That’s why it’s a separate library. I’d keep it rolling forward if we changed webdriver’s API, but otherwise just leave it to rest
[2014-09-18 11:02:31] lukeis: i'm proud of my Android team running forward with Selendroid and only WebDriver and nice PageObjects etc...
[2014-09-18 11:02:34] jarib: jimevans: if they haven't failed in forever, no one will notice if you just delete them
[2014-09-18 11:02:47] lukeis: jarib: "build masters" argue otherwise

[2014-09-18 11:03:04] simonstewart: Evacuate the building under some pretense?
[2014-09-18 11:03:08] simonstewart: Then go crazy
[2014-09-18 11:03:28] jleyba: lukeis: tell them to update the tests or delete them. give them X weeks for it to happen, then pull the trigger
[2014-09-18 11:03:45] simonstewart: To be fair, that’s what jleyba did
[2014-09-18 11:03:52] lukeis: quote from yesterday "there's features that are no longer funded, with valid tests that need to be executed to sign off on a release, but no team is budgeted to work further on the features / tests"
[2014-09-18 11:03:52] simonstewart: He’s far more of a hardass than I was about it
[2014-09-18 11:04:07] simonstewart: Who fixes the feature if it breaks?
[2014-09-18 11:04:24] lukeis: one of the teams they can find who are willing to
[2014-09-18 11:04:30] lukeis: it's up to the build master to find them
[2014-09-18 11:04:40] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-18 11:04:43] simonstewart: Then it’s up to the build master to find them, because those tests are going to break
[2014-09-18 11:05:08] lukeis: they like sitting in the past apparently...
[2014-09-18 11:05:13] jleyba: simonstewart: I'm just going to insert the following into Selenium Core's execution loop:  Math.random() > 0.5 && throw Error("Selenium Core is bad and you should feel bad; migrate to WebDriver now");
[2014-09-18 11:05:26] simonstewart: Totes legit
[2014-09-18 11:05:26] lukeis: +1
[2014-09-18 11:05:29] simonstewart: Do it
[2014-09-18 11:05:43] simonstewart: You know that I had a plan at Google to introduce flakiness into RC?
[2014-09-18 11:05:56] simonstewart: Ensure that 0.01% of all calls failed
[2014-09-18 11:06:02] simonstewart: And then increase that every day
[2014-09-18 11:06:17] simonstewart: “Gosh, RC has got unstable"
[2014-09-18 11:06:17] jleyba: simonstewart: that's redundant b/c enough teams wrote bad tests all by themselves
[2014-09-18 11:06:18] lukeis: I think I will add a message at the top of the stack trace for any propagated RC failure… "RC is bad, you should feel bad this is still running RC. Your fix is to migrate this test to WebDriver"
[2014-09-18 11:06:23] simonstewart: “Yeah. It’s the browsers...."
[2014-09-18 11:06:39] simonstewart: lukeis: swallow all stacktrace information
[2014-09-18 11:06:42] lukeis: because also, everyone only reads the top of stack traces for some reason
[2014-09-18 11:06:54] simonstewart: “Your test failed. I’m not telling you where."
[2014-09-18 11:06:56] lukeis: i wouldn't need to ;)
[2014-09-18 11:07:07] lukeis: they don't f*ing read it anyways :)
[2014-09-18 11:07:45] lukeis: i can't tell you how many bugs I've dealt with that basically summarize as "WebDriverException happened" ….
