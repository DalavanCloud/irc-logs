[2014-09-24 08:57:13] WhereIsMySpoon: daleharvey: that isnt really how it works - the standalone jar can be either a node or a hub, and you set up a "Grid" of a hub with one or more hubs that run tests. To "start chrome", you need to run selenium tests

[2014-09-24 09:57:49] jimevans: ato: might do. i'm wondering how you determine that though.
[2014-09-24 09:57:53] ato: I'm thinking of the case where you have a client speaking to a driver server via the Selenium remote server.
[2014-09-24 09:58:03] ato: And something in the remote server trips up.
[2014-09-24 09:58:33] jimevans: so you'd need to special-case the remote server, but that's not an issue, i don't think
[2014-09-24 09:58:43] ato: I have an error I know what is, but none of the existing errors seem to fit.

[2014-09-24 10:15:14] ato: Well it could be Java.  In my concrete case it's actually a Python proxy that's failing.
[2014-09-24 10:15:36] jimevans: is this for marionette? or for something else?
[2014-09-24 10:16:20] ato: It doesn't really have anything to do with this discussion, but it's a wptrunner proxy to work around CORS when making webdriver.js calls to a Selenium remote server.
[2014-09-24 10:16:30] ato: So I actually have two proxies.
[2014-09-24 10:16:31] jimevans: ah.
[2014-09-24 10:16:34] jimevans: i was just curious.
[2014-09-24 10:18:14] ato: Okay, so I have in-document JS communicating with an HTTP endpoint on the same server the document is being served by, which is a simple proxy written in Python that forwards the request to the Selenium server (which it knows about through a -w3c-proxy-endpoint capability) which again proxies it to the driver.
[2014-09-24 10:18:32] losh, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-09-24 10:19:17] ato: And I'm thinking that it would be nice for the wpt proxy to be able to return a response even if something goes wrong.
[2014-09-24 10:19:41] ato: Being able to say “this isn't the driver remote end speaking” I think would be nice.

[2014-09-24 10:31:24] ato: I think it's fine for the Selenium server to use this, but it's currently making the mistake of thinking such a status exist on the protocol level.
[2014-09-24 10:35:54] jleyba: Well we need to rewrite the server anyway
[2014-09-24 10:36:00] jleyba: Or portions of it at least
[2014-09-24 10:36:17] jleyba: s/we/someone with the commit bit that has time/
[2014-09-24 10:37:08] jimevans: jleyba: thanks for voluteering! :)
[2014-09-24 10:37:16] jimevans: or volunteering, even! :)
[2014-09-24 10:37:45] ato: Please someone rewrite the server.
[2014-09-24 10:37:51] ato: It's really terrible to work with.

[2014-09-24 10:39:33] dimacus: ato: ok i'm on it, it shall be written in perl and cgi-bin in 2 weeks
[2014-09-24 10:40:28] ato: dimacus: You know I used to do Perl right? (-;
[2014-09-24 10:40:40] dimacus: sure, who hasn't
[2014-09-24 10:41:00] jleyba: ato: I pitched jimevans on writing a server in go
[2014-09-24 10:41:11] ato: jleyba: ++
[2014-09-24 10:41:16] jleyba: Thinking I'm converting to the "Java can die in a fire" camp
[2014-09-24 10:41:37] dimacus: +1
[2014-09-24 10:41:50] dimacus: there has to be at least 1 crazy person pitching node, right?
[2014-09-24 10:42:28] *ato is happy to impersonate'
[2014-09-24 10:42:36] ato: We're writing code for the web.
[2014-09-24 10:42:39] jleyba: I view node as a toy. Fun to play with but would never do anything critical with it
[2014-09-24 10:42:39] ato: And the web is JavaScript.
[2014-09-24 10:42:49] ato: And since the web is the web is the web, we must use Node.js.
[2014-09-24 10:43:03] dimacus: what about doing it with jRuby + Sinatra?
[2014-09-24 10:43:13] dimacus: it will compile down into a jar but would not suck as much
[2014-09-24 10:43:31] jleyba: I'm sorry, I stopped reading after jRuby
[2014-09-24 10:43:36] dimacus: ha

[2014-09-24 10:45:55] dimacus: we can re-write in swift
[2014-09-24 10:46:01] dimacus: and it will only run on OSX boxes!
[2014-09-24 10:47:51] jimevans: let's write it in c++!
[2014-09-24 10:47:53] *jimevans ducks'
[2014-09-24 10:48:17] *dimacus throws a gander at jimevans '
[2014-09-24 10:48:24] *jleyba doesn't have anything against c++'
[2014-09-24 10:48:43] dimacus: actually i've been wanting to learn c++ for a while now
[2014-09-24 10:48:58] dimacus: how about htis
[2014-09-24 10:49:13] jimevans: although i note with some interest that the http server/json wire protocol bits are already in platform-independent c++. :)
[2014-09-24 10:49:26] *jleyba thinks we should write the server in go so the command to build it would be "./go go_server"'
[2014-09-24 10:49:27] dimacus: instead of re-writing the server and the grid, we write down a standard set of apis and anyone can implement the apis in whatever langauge they want
[2014-09-24 10:49:39] ianbrandt, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-24 10:50:34] jleyba: dimacus: we should define those apis in xml and then we can generate language bindings
[2014-09-24 10:50:41] jleyba: wait...that sounds familiar...
[2014-09-24 10:50:46] jimevans: as i go wandering off to dust off my strontium code.
[2014-09-24 10:51:27] dimacus: <xml><action>GET</action><response>rm -rf /</response></xml>
[2014-09-24 10:51:35] dimacus: here you go, i've defined the first api end point in xml

[2014-09-24 11:33:00] jimevans: and never be heard from again...
[2014-09-24 11:33:17] dimacus: if you don't do it, it starts to hang and eat up 50% of recourses when idle
[2014-09-24 11:33:36] dimacus: elyezer: i started to restart fluxbox each build and all slowness and problems went away

[2014-09-24 11:34:54] elyezer: dimacus: how do you kill it? kill -9?
[2014-09-24 11:35:04] dimacus: yeah… i had to do it outside of the test with good old fashion kill -9
[2014-09-24 11:35:10] dimacus: one sec i'll find the code
