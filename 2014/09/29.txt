[2014-09-29 02:15:57] ato: Oh I'm sorry.  What kind of logs are we talking about here?
[2014-09-29 02:16:14] WhereIsMySpoon: driver logs
[2014-09-29 02:16:16] ato: I was referring to the console.log logs and like.
[2014-09-29 02:16:38] WhereIsMySpoon: I'm having renderer timeouts fairly regularly when doing remote execution and I'd like more info
[2014-09-29 02:16:45] ato: Specifically how do you enable it?
[2014-09-29 02:17:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: with LoggingPreferences, then logPrefs.enable(LogType.Browser, Level.ALL); logPrefs.enable(LogType.DRIVER, LogType.ALL); caps.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOGGING_PREFS, logPrefs);
[2014-09-29 02:18:11] WhereIsMySpoon: figured I'd enable browser and driver logs
[2014-09-29 02:18:12] ato: Okay, so those go into the Logs interface.
[2014-09-29 02:18:16] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-09-29 02:18:24] WhereIsMySpoon: is there a way to just get the driver log itself?
[2014-09-29 02:18:30] WhereIsMySpoon: im sure I did it before once
[2014-09-29 02:18:33] ato: You have to retrieve them each time because the driver might not be local.
[2014-09-29 02:18:39] WhereIsMySpoon: well it isnt local :D
[2014-09-29 02:19:05] ato: Possibly, it depends on whether the remote server has support for propagating driver logs through that API.
[2014-09-29 02:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: I guess I can just output the browser and driver logs into local files
[2014-09-29 02:19:12] ato: You could get the list of available logs and see.

[2014-09-29 05:48:21] jimb_: but the point of using grid, with in our case 4 nodes, is to execute the suites faster (in total time), is it not?
[2014-09-29 05:48:44] WhereIsMySpoon: ah I see, you have multiple nodes
[2014-09-29 05:48:54] jimb_: correct
[2014-09-29 05:49:00] WhereIsMySpoon: so you're saying with 4 nodes, if you had 8 tests, doing 2 tests per node, it takes the same time as doing all 8 on one local machine?
[2014-09-29 05:49:10] jimb_: correct
[2014-09-29 05:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-09-29 05:49:21] WhereIsMySpoon: do your nodes suck?
[2014-09-29 05:49:22] jimb_: yeah, my thoughts exactly
[2014-09-29 05:49:48] jimb_: vmware vm's with sufficient cpu, memory and so on to handle 100 browser instances...
[2014-09-29 05:50:10] WhereIsMySpoon: and I assume you have at least a similar setup on the nodes as you do on the local machine wrt the browser you use etc
[2014-09-29 05:50:30] WhereIsMySpoon: i.e. you aren't using phantomjs on the nodes and chrome on the local machine or something like that right
[2014-09-29 05:51:07] jimb_: nope, we're basically at the stage where we're still just using FF
[2014-09-29 05:51:22] jimb_: and the hub, resides on the same machine as our CI (jenkins).
[2014-09-29 05:51:32] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-09-29 05:51:43] jimb_: I've tried running the same test-suite with 4 nodes, 1 node and grid "turned off"
[2014-09-29 05:51:49] Dave_B_: are the tests actually running in parallel?
[2014-09-29 05:51:52] jimb_: total execution time is similar
[2014-09-29 05:52:09] d0x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-29 05:52:17] jimb_: probably not, but I haven't been able to figure out why
[2014-09-29 05:52:30] Dave_B_: the grid doesn't make them parallel, just gives the capability. It's up to you/your test runner to actually run them in parallel
[2014-09-29 05:53:02] Dave_B_: I don't know anything about testoob
[2014-09-29 05:53:21] jimb_: ah, so that was what I was _suspecting_, but I haven't been able to find any documentiation anywhere to show me the "how"
[2014-09-29 05:53:40] jimb_: @dave_b: testoob stopped being developed in 2006… *hrm

[2014-09-29 05:55:05] jimb_: So then the question I have to figure the answer to is how to tie that together with lettuce
[2014-09-29 05:55:06] Dave_B_: ^ that's basically what I did to run my 'behave' cucumber scripts in parallel in a previous job
[2014-09-29 05:55:22] WhereIsMySpoon: jimb_: drizzle lettuce in salad dressing, consume

[2014-09-29 05:55:33] jimb_: :D

[2014-09-29 05:56:16] jimb_: Yeah, I was actually reading that before i came on here.
[2014-09-29 05:56:40] jimb_: I just can't see the matrix yet when it comes to how to tie it together with grid
[2014-09-29 05:56:59] jimb_: since I thought grid handled the whole parallellization for m...
[2014-09-29 05:57:02] WhereIsMySpoon: grid has largely nothing to do with parallel test running
[2014-09-29 05:57:05] jimb_: rtfm, I guess...
[2014-09-29 05:57:07] jimb_: ya
[2014-09-29 05:57:08] Dave_B_: word of warning: If they've never been parallel then there may be unexpected complications like all using one driver instance or something
[2014-09-29 05:57:20] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ make sure your code doesnt suck
[2014-09-29 05:57:24] Dave_B_: or one test setting up state for a later test etc
[2014-09-29 05:57:41] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ogodwhy
[2014-09-29 05:57:47] Dave_B_: yeah :(
[2014-09-29 05:57:55] jimb_: That much they've handled before me.
[2014-09-29 05:58:00] jimb_: question is if it works
[2014-09-29 05:58:04] WhereIsMySpoon: tias :)
[2014-09-29 05:58:07] *Dave_B_ spent several months reworking a test suite at another job where everything was interdependant :('
[2014-09-29 05:58:16] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: :(
[2014-09-29 05:58:35] jimb_: not to mention, that we set up data thru the client (ie http requests) :(
[2014-09-29 05:58:55] WhereIsMySpoon: whaa
[2014-09-29 05:59:02] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-09-29 05:59:09] jimb_: yeah, that wasn't a typo
[2014-09-29 05:59:22] Dave_B_: sounds like it's got the potential to blow up horribly in your face! :S
[2014-09-29 05:59:32] jimb_: like I said, our entire 500+ test suite is built upon a great big hack
[2014-09-29 05:59:34] WhereIsMySpoon: the one thing that I do use http requests for is to test download functionality
[2014-09-29 05:59:42] WhereIsMySpoon: because you shouldnt ever test files with selenium
[2014-09-29 05:59:49] WhereIsMySpoon: as it isn't Robot
[2014-09-29 05:59:52] jimb_: right
[2014-09-29 06:00:18] jimb_: so, umm, job-security anyone? :D

[2014-09-29 06:32:34] ato: jimb_: nose is down to the bones and will probably do whatever you want.  It's more of a test runner than anything else.
[2014-09-29 06:33:06] WhereIsMySpoon: jimb_: sure I do :)

[2014-09-29 06:35:18] ato: I don't think you can go wrong with either one.
[2014-09-29 06:35:47] ato: As for reports, my best advice is to make them machine readable.
[2014-09-29 06:36:03] ato: Eventually you're infrastructure is going to grow to the point where you want other systems to be able to pick up the reports and parse them.

[2014-09-29 08:02:06] joshin4colours: WhereIsMySpoon: in a lot of web apps, clicking elements trigger file dialogs. It might be helpful to work with them in some cases
[2014-09-29 08:02:33] joshin4colours: WhereIsMySpoon: Not that i would endorse this kind of thing :)
[2014-09-29 08:03:07] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to upload a file, set the <input type="file"... > element
[2014-09-29 08:03:33] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to test file download, run a http connection to the url that is generated and test the response
[2014-09-29 08:03:51] WhereIsMySpoon: what other file dialog stuff joshin4colours ?
[2014-09-29 08:04:14] ato: WhereIsMySpoon is correct.  You don't generally want to be testing OS level controls.
[2014-09-29 08:04:25] ato: (There are some exceptions.)

[2014-09-29 08:05:34] joshin4colours: WhereIsMySpoon, ato: but it might be helpful to dismiss these OS dialogs that appear during tests (similar to alerts). You're not "testing" them per se
[2014-09-29 08:05:55] ato: Does closing the file dialogue trigger an event?
[2014-09-29 08:05:56] WhereIsMySpoon: they are automatically dealt with if you do what I said
[2014-09-29 08:06:10] ato: What exactly are you testing?
[2014-09-29 08:06:13] WhereIsMySpoon: setting the input type=file element does all the file selecting automatically
[2014-09-29 08:06:26] WhereIsMySpoon: and doing the download respons checking doesnt even go near the OS dialogs

[2014-09-29 08:13:32] joshin4colours: but the file download functionality isn't built yet, so picking a file and clicking "ok" doesn't do anything to the webapp
[2014-09-29 08:13:33] Dave_B_: the dialogue appearing is testing the os tho

[2014-09-29 08:16:04] joshin4colours: hmmm....I think this discussion is confirming my opinion that "using selenium" for file upload/download isn't a great idea
[2014-09-29 08:17:25] d0x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-09-29 08:17:43] ato: Some background to this is that <input type=file> elements in browsers have a lot of security built around them.  The file dialogue that appears also blocks JavaScript execution and with the lack of a library to interact with those, our only option is to dismiss them.
[2014-09-29 08:17:56] jimb_, quitting. (Quit: jimb_)
[2014-09-29 08:18:10] ato: By security I mean that they are inaccessible from JavaScript, for example.
[2014-09-29 08:21:13] WhereIsMySpoon: joshin4colours: that isnt true
[2014-09-29 08:21:42] WhereIsMySpoon: As I said, I use selenium fine for file uploads, and for downloads I just use a simple http response post/receive checker

[2014-09-29 08:23:42] joshin4colours: WhereIsMySpoon: the browser node, machine launching the tests and file location aren't always the same, or even predictable

[2014-09-29 08:24:35] WhereIsMySpoon: yup
[2014-09-29 08:24:42] jimevans: ato: .NET has a similar construct too.

[2014-09-29 08:25:26] WhereIsMySpoon: so say I have a dummyFIle.txt in myproj/res/, I can then just do myElement.sendKeys(new File("res/dummyFile.txt").getAbsolutePath())
[2014-09-29 08:25:26] jimevans: that's why i piped up.

[2014-09-29 08:26:06] jimevans: but i know that joshin4colours has at least a passing background with .NET, so i thought it worth mentioning.

[2014-09-29 10:00:09] dude-x: heh
[2014-09-29 10:00:25] dude-x: 25mpg is not great but for a big van thing it's not too bad
[2014-09-29 10:00:33] dimacus: 25mpg for a car that comfortably sits 7 people, that's great
[2014-09-29 10:00:40] dude-x: yeah
[2014-09-29 10:00:47] dimacus: my brother owns a subaru forester, 17mpg
[2014-09-29 10:00:50] Dave_B_: 25 of your mpg is 30 of our mpg roughly, which is ok for a big van thing
[2014-09-29 10:00:54] dimacus: and 1/2 the internal capacity

[2014-09-29 10:03:38] Dave_B_: yeah, electric has a lot of significant advantages
[2014-09-29 10:03:38] dude-x: tires can cost quite a bit though
[2014-09-29 10:03:42] KyleG: yes
[2014-09-29 10:03:48] KyleG: my boss has the tesla model S P85+
[2014-09-29 10:03:52] KyleG: he said his tires last like 8k miles
[2014-09-29 10:04:04] dude-x: is that good or bad?
[2014-09-29 10:04:07] KyleG: bad

[2014-09-29 10:04:17] dimacus: that's terrible
[2014-09-29 10:04:22] Dave_B_: it's about what I get, but then I take my car racing :S
[2014-09-29 10:04:31] dimacus: that's like chaning tires every 8 to 9 months
[2014-09-29 10:04:38] KyleG: meh
[2014-09-29 10:04:39] dimacus: and they cost $150 a piece
[2014-09-29 10:04:44] dude-x: what's the average life span of tires if you don't do odd things like peel out, or stupid stuff
[2014-09-29 10:04:46] KyleG: LOL more than that buddy
[2014-09-29 10:04:52] KyleG: the Model S has like 19" wheels I think
[2014-09-29 10:04:58] KyleG: and they must be at least what, 255 in the back?
[2014-09-29 10:05:05] KyleG: probably looking @ 200-250/tire

[2014-09-29 11:21:24] dimacus: is OperaDriver class treated differently in WebDriver compared to ChromeDriver or IEDriver?
[2014-09-29 11:22:20] jimevans: define "differently". if i understand your question correctly, the answer is "yes". it doesn't use an HTTP client for communication with the browser's driver.
[2014-09-29 11:22:28] jimevans: it uses the scope protocol directly.
[2014-09-29 11:22:58] dimacus: basically when i try to get a new instance of FF or Chrome, i do something like this (in java)
[2014-09-29 11:22:58] dimacus: WebDriver firef = new FirefoxDriver();

[2014-09-29 11:23:12] dimacus: however, same thing is not working with Opera
[2014-09-29 11:23:12] dimacus: WebDriver opera = new OperaDriver();
[2014-09-29 11:23:41] dimacus: it seems Opera is in a completely different package than others, as in, not inside of org.openqa.selenium....
[2014-09-29 11:23:45] jimevans: opera is.
[2014-09-29 11:23:51] dimacus: instead it's in com.opera.core.systems
[2014-09-29 11:23:53] jimevans: it's "developed" by opera software.
[2014-09-29 11:24:03] elstif, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-09-29 11:24:12] jimevans: (developed is in scare quotes because it's abandonware at this point)
[2014-09-29 11:24:15] dimacus: gotcha, so in order to acess it i need to make it as a dependency in maven etc..
[2014-09-29 11:24:21] dimacus: crap
[2014-09-29 11:24:26] dimacus: ok i just give up on opera then
[2014-09-29 11:24:39] dimacus: not worth the effort i'm currently putting in
[2014-09-29 11:25:04] jimevans: agreed. particularly when it's not even applicable to modern versions of opera.
[2014-09-29 11:25:49] ato: WebDriver opera = new OperaDriver() should work, but it might be broken because no one is working on it.
[2014-09-29 11:26:03] dimacus: cool!
[2014-09-29 11:26:08] *dimacus walks away with his sanity'
[2014-09-29 11:26:11] ato: Also note that it doesn't work with the non-Presto based Operas.
[2014-09-29 11:27:18] smccarthy: phew. It was mssed up, because I accidentally tried to start two hubs, so it killed Selenium-Grid-Extras on the first hub (I think thats what happened). Note to self, don't try and start two hubs, yet
[2014-09-29 11:27:39] dimacus: yet
[2014-09-29 11:28:01] dimacus: ato: roger wilco, the person who asked for me to add opera support shall be turned down hard!
[2014-09-29 11:28:29] ato: dimacus: Oh well it won't work with any of the Chromium based Operas.
[2014-09-29 11:29:03] ato: And now Opera is pretty much the same as Chromium, so you're covered if you test on that.
[2014-09-29 11:29:25] ato: So technically you're already testing it (-;

[2014-09-29 14:07:48] Machtyn: I'm not always using css. sometimes JQuery or XPath is necessary.
[2014-09-29 14:08:59] jimevans: anyway, let's think about what you're doing here. every By you pass in to ByChained means you're calling FindElement.
[2014-09-29 14:10:34] jimevans: and the only way jquery and/or xpath should be required is if you're trying to find on the text within an element. which is going to be incredibly brittle, so i'd recommend not doing that.
