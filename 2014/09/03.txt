[2014-09-03 04:48:26] bobacus: Hi, WebDriver was working for me yesterday with Firefox, but not today. I believe the only change is Firefox 31 -> Firefox 32. I'm using Ubuntu 12.
[2014-09-03 04:49:48] ma: bobacus, which selenium version you are using and for which language?
[2014-09-03 04:50:52] bobacus: 2.42, for Java
[2014-09-03 04:50:56] bobacus: 2.42.2
[2014-09-03 04:54:18] ma: as per my understanding there is no support in 2.42.2 for ff32
[2014-09-03 04:54:18] barancev: yes, FF32 is not supported yet
[2014-09-03 04:55:14] bobacus: ok thanks, I'll downgrade FF. Any idea when support for FF32 is likely to be available?
[2014-09-03 04:55:19] ma: ff32 is release on spetember so it take some time to put support in webdriver
[2014-09-03 04:55:36] barancev: soon :)

[2014-09-03 06:30:29] phutchins: googling...
[2014-09-03 06:30:40] ato: Right, if you have JS that reads the title attribute and makes changes to the DOM it's a different story.

[2014-09-03 06:32:29] phutchins: and we're talking about making changes to the dom from the selenium test side, nto the webpage side right?
[2014-09-03 06:32:36] ato: phutchins: Native events imply events injected into the operating system's event queue.
[2014-09-03 06:32:59] phutchins: ato: yeah, i see now... reading on the wiki about that.
[2014-09-03 06:33:02] ato: I was actually replying to barancev's comment on ma's question.
[2014-09-03 06:33:19] phutchins: My issues started showing up where i would get 2/4 or 3/4 of the transactions completed then the last one would timeout
[2014-09-03 06:33:33] phutchins: it got to where it would NEVER finish. but it was atleast finishing some of the transactions so its weird
[2014-09-03 06:33:40] phutchins: ato: ah :)
[2014-09-03 06:34:00] ato: Timing and race condition issues.
[2014-09-03 06:34:42] ato: Even if WebDriver supplies a blocking API, that doesn't mean it knows about your web app.
[2014-09-03 06:34:44] phutchins: ato: how do you mean?
[2014-09-03 06:35:16] phutchins: or are you commenting on the other question? :)
[2014-09-03 06:35:19] ato: So if your web app takes a little while to perform some operation, WebDriver won't know about that and continue its next operation.
[2014-09-03 06:35:56] ato: Leaving you with a race condition causing the type of unstable test results you may be seeing.
[2014-09-03 06:36:32] phutchins: so i have a wait in place. wiat = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => $wait_timeout)  and then wait.until { driver.find_element(:class_name, "vehicle") }

[2014-09-03 06:36:49] phutchins: thing is, that class is loaded in jquery so its not like a completely new page load.
[2014-09-03 06:36:59] phutchins: ato: does that sound like what you're describing?
[2014-09-03 06:37:11] phutchins: I just don't understand because it worked perfectly before, for months...
[2014-09-03 06:37:31] ato: Yes, this is what I was talking about.
[2014-09-03 06:37:55] ato: The Wait class doesn't have any special casing for page loads, it's very stupid.

[2014-09-03 06:38:53] gp5st: hello.  I'm using selenium from java in ubuntu.  Yesterday everything was working fine.  I did an update this morning that updated firefox (now at 32, unsure previously) and the browser window loads, but it doesn't load. http://dpaste.com/2TZ13G5.txt is the top part of the stack trace

[2014-09-03 06:39:17] gp5st: ato: well that would explain that
[2014-09-03 06:39:25] gp5st: I'll just figure out how to downgrade
[2014-09-03 06:39:30] gp5st: thanks ato
[2014-09-03 06:39:45] ato: For native events, I should add.  Synthetic events might work?
[2014-09-03 06:39:46] bobacus: gp5st: I just  had that. http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/ may help if you need version 31
[2014-09-03 06:40:15] gp5st: thanks bobacus
[2014-09-03 06:49:28] davehunt: it sounds like Selenium isn't working at all with Firefox 32
[2014-09-03 06:49:35] phutchins: ato: hum. gotcha. Is there another or better way to look for that class to be loaded?
[2014-09-03 06:49:54] davehunt: barancev: do we know what the problem is?
[2014-09-03 06:50:35] phutchins: ato: if you wouldn't mind taking a look, I have the code here... https://github.com/phutchins/supernova/blob/master/files/default/supernova.rb
[2014-09-03 06:50:52] barancev: davehunt: the main incompatibility is already fixed

[2014-09-03 06:51:32] barancev: right

[2014-09-03 06:52:16] barancev: sytnthesized events should be ok in ff32 (in the trunk)

[2014-09-03 12:42:35] lukeis: what OS? if on windows or linux, not likely to work
[2014-09-03 12:42:42] flecha: Linux
[2014-09-03 12:42:43] lukeis: on mac, it is likely :)

[2014-09-03 12:43:06] lukeis: or set it on the profile
[2014-09-03 12:43:09] flecha: but it worked well yesterday...
[2014-09-03 12:43:16] flecha: capability?
[2014-09-03 12:43:19] barancev: FF32 is totally unsupported
[2014-09-03 12:43:33] lukeis: maybe FF auto updated on you? :)
[2014-09-03 12:43:39] barancev: until we ship 2.43
[2014-09-03 12:43:42] lukeis: barancev: are we ready to make a new release?
[2014-09-03 12:43:46] lukeis: what's blocking?
[2014-09-03 12:44:00] flecha: I'll try to download an old FF
[2014-09-03 12:44:02] barancev: I think we have to update prebuilts for FF32
[2014-09-03 12:44:18] lukeis: ah
[2014-09-03 12:44:28] barancev: to enable native events too
[2014-09-03 12:44:52] barancev: and I hope a bunch of the commiters gathered at the conf will be able to spend some time to do a release :)
[2014-09-03 12:45:08] lukeis: aren't native events borked on linux all around anyways?

[2014-09-03 12:50:02] lukeis: firefox native events are only slightly higher in priority than Selenium RC ;)
[2014-09-03 12:50:05] barancev: but, anyway, we have to take into account the GLIBCXX version
[2014-09-03 12:50:24] dude-x: so about that 2.43.0.....

[2014-09-03 12:52:16] lukeis: sure
[2014-09-03 12:55:09] Machtyn: Ah, yes, Thanks lukeis (and selbot2).  Each time I search for ByChained, I got the javadoc which states it's located in OpenQA.Selenium.Support.PageObjects.  Well, I got the same thing. Must be an environmental thing for me at the moment.

[2014-09-03 14:32:17] Choicefresh: Hi. I'm currently trying to use Selenium to automate some research using web searches. Firefox support breaking today was a little startling as I had been planning to use my script long-term and share it with others. To avoid compatibility problems in the future, is there any logical solution besides sharing a copy of portable firefox?
[2014-09-03 14:32:30] Choicefresh: Or would I be better off using a different automation suite entirely?
[2014-09-03 14:32:44] lukeis: you could use chrome + chromedriver
[2014-09-03 14:32:58] barancev: or ESR releases of Firefox
[2014-09-03 14:33:06] phutchins, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-09-03 14:33:10] lukeis: but the typical answer with firefox is to lock your version and not update it until you know that selenium will work
[2014-09-03 14:33:12] barancev: or (omg!) IE
[2014-09-03 14:33:21] lukeis: (ESR is a good one to pick)
[2014-09-03 14:33:29] barancev: IE? I told this?
[2014-09-03 14:33:35] *lukeis doesn't know why'
[2014-09-03 14:34:10] Choicefresh: Well Chrome and IE might face the same problems eventually as they're updated, no?
[2014-09-03 14:34:44] jleyba: Choicefresh you will *always* have to deal with potential version conflicts
[2014-09-03 14:34:54] jleyba: Just need to choose which browser's you want to deal with

[2014-09-03 14:38:00] Choicefresh: Yeah, it seems to me that the best solution would be to package a copy of Portable Firefox with the script. But that's 70MB. Is there an approach I'm not thinking of?
[2014-09-03 14:39:42] Choicefresh: and IE and Opera are updated less often than FF and Chrome but they're very heavy
[2014-09-03 14:40:29] lukeis: chrome does a bit of a better jobâ€¦. don't even think about trying to use opera with selenium ;)

[2014-09-03 15:27:38] lukeis: d0x: it's a very hard thing to debugâ€¦ since the javascript included in firefox-driver is compressed by the closure compilerâ€¦ and then add on top of that we use "crazy-fun" to do some interesting mappings on how files get 'composed' together
[2014-09-03 15:28:39] d0x: Hm, thats said :(. I just like to add some custom stuff to the firefoxdriver.js. For that i got the tip on the mailing list to use the "Browser Toolkit". But it doesn't work because of this :(

[2014-09-03 15:56:23] ngTransgender: things like [0] [1] [2] [3].  And seeing as all the testrunners talk about Junit and this is what I'm using, I don't see a way aroudn this limitation, therefore parameterization is not an option

[2014-09-03 15:59:28] AutomatedTester: d0x: I was bored with 1 specific email

[2014-09-03 16:01:27] ngTransgender: well. it looks like i'm going to have to parameterize on numbers, map those numbers to a hash map of functions which return drivers because selenium + junit has been architected alll wrong
