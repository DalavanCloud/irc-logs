[2014-09-26 09:42:11] Moony22: eg. as a feature in my app
[2014-09-26 09:42:53] ato: Moony22: Of course there is.  WebDriver isn't a testing tool specifically.
[2014-09-26 09:42:57] ato: It's a library.
[2014-09-26 09:43:15] Moony22: ato: great, well I dont really understand the documentation
[2014-09-26 09:43:27] ato: Okay.  Which part don't you understand?

[2014-09-26 09:52:19] Moony22: jimevans: like, I want a webview and my app to automatically type a certain phrase into a text box
[2014-09-26 09:52:27] Moony22: on a certain website
[2014-09-26 09:52:40] WhereIsMySpoon: you know that you can just use js event handlers to do something like that
[2014-09-26 09:52:49] Moony22: I don't know how

[2014-09-26 09:53:30] Moony22: seems easier like this
[2014-09-26 09:53:36] Moony22: I've never used JS
[2014-09-26 09:53:37] WhereIsMySpoon: Moony22: so you click a link and your view comes up, and it automatically types in text into a box after the view is loaded?
[2014-09-26 09:53:50] Moony22: WhereIsMySpoon: i think so
[2014-09-26 09:54:00] Moony22: WhereIsMySpoon: when I say a view, I mean a webview
[2014-09-26 09:54:10] WhereIsMySpoon: that sounds like a domain specific word
[2014-09-26 09:54:14] WhereIsMySpoon: what is a "webview"
[2014-09-26 09:54:19] Moony22: android
[2014-09-26 09:54:28] Moony22: one sec
[2014-09-26 09:54:29] WhereIsMySpoon: that doesnt really help
[2014-09-26 09:54:36] Moony22: its a view that displays a webpage
[2014-09-26 09:54:45] WhereIsMySpoon: im not familiar with android terminology
[2014-09-26 09:54:51] jimevans: i figured it might be something like that. yeah, i think selendroid is gonna be the wrong tool for the job.
[2014-09-26 09:55:02] Moony22: why?
[2014-09-26 09:55:07] antsanto, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-26 09:55:20] jimevans: you'd be far better off just calling the evaluateJavascript method on the webview, and using javascript to find and simulate typing into the element on the page loaded by the webview.

[2014-09-26 09:56:04] WhereIsMySpoon: why are you doing web dev then?
[2014-09-26 09:56:07] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused

[2014-09-26 09:56:08] Moony22: I'm not
[2014-09-26 09:56:14] WhereIsMySpoon: "webview"?
[2014-09-26 09:56:25] jimevans: webview is a type of control in android apps
[2014-09-26 09:56:34] jimevans: allowing the app to display a web page
[2014-09-26 09:56:40] Moony22: android dev
[2014-09-26 09:56:47] Dave_B_: writing webpages
[2014-09-26 09:56:55] Moony22: I'm not writing webpages
[2014-09-26 09:56:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ok well in any case, there will be some sort of onload event in android, java, javascript or whatever
[2014-09-26 09:57:02] WhereIsMySpoon: or even in the webview model
[2014-09-26 09:58:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you know on http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html there is an example of an event handler
[2014-09-26 09:58:05] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, the webview control in the android sdk has an evaluateJavascript method that executes javascript in the context of the loaded page.
[2014-09-26 09:58:11] WhereIsMySpoon: onReceivedError
[2014-09-26 09:58:26] WhereIsMySpoon: i would bet money that there is an onViewLoad or similar
[2014-09-26 09:58:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or onSucces
[2014-09-26 09:58:59] WhereIsMySpoon: so find that, and inside it make it set the value of this text field
[2014-09-26 09:59:55] WhereIsMySpoon: what you've tried to ask us to help you with is the equivalent of someone going "i want to write on this paper, but I have no way to write on it. better go get a robot to write on it for me" rather than saying "better go get a pencil to write on it"
[2014-09-26 10:00:08] WhereIsMySpoon: its just unecessary
[2014-09-26 10:00:09] Moony22: I might learn how to do it with JS then
[2014-09-26 10:00:38] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: it might not be quite as simple as document.getElementById('id').value = "new value";
[2014-09-26 10:00:47] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, but i doubt it will be compelx
[2014-09-26 10:00:49] WhereIsMySpoon: complex*
[2014-09-26 10:00:57] jimevans: (think event handlers on the <input> element.
[2014-09-26 10:01:05] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-09-26 10:01:12] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever it is, it wont be very complicated
[2014-09-26 10:01:17] jimevans: it makes a difference what site the webview is going to be displaying.
[2014-09-26 10:01:33] Moony22: i can tell you what kind of element

[2014-09-26 10:02:03] jimevans: if you're wanting to "type into a field", then it'll be an <input> element or a <textarea> element.

[2014-09-26 10:02:14] Moony22: jimevans: it's an <input> element
[2014-09-26 10:02:14] jimevans: in all likelihood
[2014-09-26 10:03:06] jimevans: right, but that's not the whole of it. what javascript event handlers have the website developers hooked up to the element? do you know? can you find out? it may make a difference in your implementation, is all i'm trying to get across.
[2014-09-26 10:04:03] Moony22: well I see an onkeyup and onchange
[2014-09-26 10:04:07] jimevans: take, for example, the default google search page. it's all ajax-ed up to provide suggestions for the search. i don't know if simply setting the value property of that <input> element with javascript would be enough to trigger those events.
[2014-09-26 10:04:48] Moony22: I don't need to trigger something like suggestions
[2014-09-26 10:06:02] jimevans: okay, so depending on what behavior you're attempting to elicit from the site you're typing into the field, you may need to invoke those event handlers. there are ways to do that with javascript, but i just want you to be aware that the solution may require more than just a one-line javascript execution.
[2014-09-26 10:06:31] Moony22: okay, thanks jimevans. I might as well get started and see what happens
[2014-09-26 10:07:57] jimevans: and again, you've not told us what site it is you'd be browsing to, so i'm offering advice blind, but we've strayed pretty far from this actually having anything to do with selenium. which is not to say we're not willing to talk about it here in the channel; we're not that strict about content. :) but don't be surprised if there's maybe less response than you'd want.

[2014-09-26 10:58:13] dimacus: smccarthy: see coming from ruby, i initially had this thing where classes were loaded from Strings at runtime
[2014-09-26 10:58:37] smccarthy: nice !
[2014-09-26 10:58:42] smccarthy: guess thats not the case in java ?
[2014-09-26 10:58:45] dimacus: i was told it was bad practice in Java, so i switchted to class namesâ€¦ who would have thunk it would break the ability to find the classes
[2014-09-26 11:08:48] dimacus: smccarthy: pushed fix
[2014-09-26 11:10:09] smccarthy: thx
[2014-09-26 11:10:29] dimacus: one place needed to still be a string otherwise the JVM was trying to load a non existing class into memory

[2014-09-26 11:15:12] smccarthy: it compiles lol
[2014-09-26 11:15:27] dimacus: lol what about starting at least 1 hub?
[2014-09-26 11:15:29] smccarthy: and i tested it a little, but I can use it more
[2014-09-26 11:15:43] smccarthy: yea it does use the hub json config
[2014-09-26 11:15:55] smccarthy: only 1 hub so far.

[2014-09-26 11:29:01] barancev: yes, moving to gson
[2014-09-26 11:29:07] dimacus: i like Gson a lot
[2014-09-26 11:29:10] barancev: because the license
[2014-09-26 11:29:24] dimacus: minus the fact that it converts 1 => 1.0
[2014-09-26 11:29:28] dimacus: but that's nit picking
[2014-09-26 11:29:51] barancev: I know how to work around it :)
[2014-09-26 11:30:12] barancev: Gson converst all to double, JsonParser does not
[2014-09-26 11:30:18] dimacus: ahhhh
[2014-09-26 11:30:34] dimacus: i've been using the new Gson().fromJson(foo, HashMap.class);
[2014-09-26 11:30:58] barancev: JsonParser is a more precise tool
[2014-09-26 11:31:03] dimacus: barancev: btw this makes me extreamely happy:
[2014-09-26 11:31:04] dimacus: new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create().toJson(parsedJson)
[2014-09-26 11:31:20] dimacus: pretty pretty json :)
[2014-09-26 11:31:46] barancev: Gson has another pitfall - it if field-based, not getter-based
[2014-09-26 11:32:28] dimacus: yeah, and it seems to do some black magic when you tell it to load some json into an existing class object
[2014-09-26 11:32:41] dimacus: it goes in and modifies all of the private fields somehow
[2014-09-26 11:33:02] barancev: yes
[2014-09-26 11:33:28] dimacus: i could not figure out forever how it would give me a new object that has no setters for a private fieldâ€¦ so voodoo magic
[2014-09-26 11:33:50] dimacus: koldovstvo!
[2014-09-26 11:39:36] dimacus: smccarthy: so send me a PR whenver you are done testing and i'll test it some more locally and push it to master
[2014-09-26 11:39:47] dimacus: maybe add multi hub setup if I have free time
