[2014-09-17 02:40:37] andy_seit: I thought all transitions but the docs specifies setting url

[2014-09-17 03:02:58] andy_seit: ITimeouts summarises it as /// Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait for a page to load when setting the <see cref="IWebDriver.Url"/> property.
[2014-09-17 03:06:39] andy_seit: Hrm.  Looking at the test 'ShouldTimeoutIfAPageTakesTooLongToLoad', it looks like it only covers driver.Url

[2014-09-17 03:14:03] andy_seit: RemoteNavigator.GoToUrl sets driver.Url, so that's covered, but I'm not sure where to find the code that covers user-initiated transitions
[2014-09-17 03:15:09] WhereIsMySpoon: andy_seit: if you need waits for if you click on, say, an anchor element that goes to mywebsite/somepage.html, then you just need to wait for an element like normal
[2014-09-17 03:15:20] barancev|2: what you want is located in the drivers' code, not the client libs code
[2014-09-17 03:16:28] barancev|2: selenium wants on any operation when it detectes that the page is loading at the moment the operation is invoked
[2014-09-17 03:16:37] barancev|2: s/wants/waits/
[2014-09-17 03:16:47] andy_seit: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm basically just trying to figure out if for user-initiated transitions, pageloadtimeout is still obeyed for waiting for non-async connections to complete (third party js loads etc)
[2014-09-17 03:16:57] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont think so
[2014-09-17 03:17:02] WhereIsMySpoon: though I may be wrong
[2014-09-17 03:17:09] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev|2 can confirm prolly :)
[2014-09-17 03:17:11] barancev|2: what are "user-initiated transitions"?
[2014-09-17 03:17:20] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev|2: stuff like I said
[2014-09-17 03:17:24] andy_seit: barancev|2:  Thanks for that, I'll start poking about chromedriver
[2014-09-17 03:17:27] WhereIsMySpoon: not driver.get
[2014-09-17 03:17:39] andy_seit: ^^ yes
[2014-09-17 03:18:03] barancev|2: e.g. click loads a new page, right?
[2014-09-17 03:18:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ya
[2014-09-17 03:18:31] barancev|2: behaviour can be (and is) different in drivers
[2014-09-17 03:18:39] andy_seit: so if I click a submit, the browser transitions to a new page, I thought webdriver would automatically wait for non-async network connections to complete and document.readystate==complete before continuing
[2014-09-17 03:19:42] WhereIsMySpoon: I dont think so
[2014-09-17 03:20:01] barancev|2: what if a click calls a js function that loads a new page after a 2s timeout? should selenium wait? what exactly?
[2014-09-17 03:20:04] WhereIsMySpoon: and im pretty sure if jimevans was here right now he'd be saying stuff about what "ready" really means
[2014-09-17 03:20:21] WhereIsMySpoon: what baran said
[2014-09-17 03:21:03] andy_seit: wouldn't webdriver still detect that a navigation had occurred?  Navigation start/complete events?
[2014-09-17 03:21:24] barancev|2: at which moment? immediately after click?
[2014-09-17 03:21:44] andy_seit: no at navigation, when the browser transitions / changes state
[2014-09-17 03:22:00] barancev|2: there are no "callbacks" from browser to selenium
[2014-09-17 03:22:39] barancev|2: actually, selenium waits *before* an operation if the page is not in document.readystate==complete
[2014-09-17 03:23:20] andy_seit: Aha!
[2014-09-17 03:23:23] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-09-17 03:23:29] andy_seit: Thats basically what I was looking for
[2014-09-17 03:23:39] sircapsalot, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 03:23:48] andy_seit: that would suggest that its obeying pageloadtimeout
[2014-09-17 03:24:21] barancev|2: if it can detect document.readystate change immediately after click -- it waits after click. if it thinks that document.readystate is not changed immediately it returms from click, cut can wait before the next operation
[2014-09-17 03:24:25] andy_seit: for transitions that have a subsequent action (e.g. a click or whatever on the subsequent page)
[2014-09-17 03:25:15] barancev|2: it does not wait if you use Actions
[2014-09-17 03:25:28] andy_seit: thanks Alexei I think you've answered my question

[2014-09-17 04:29:37] Dave_B_: if you look at the node itself can you see it receiving the confirmation of being on the grid? I've seen before that the web grid console claims nodes are present when it recieves the request to join, but the node never gets told it's been successful
[2014-09-17 04:29:59] Dave_B_: (the new grid web status console thingie is worse for this than the old one)
[2014-09-17 04:31:30] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-09-17 04:31:32] WhereIsMySpoon: will check
[2014-09-17 04:32:09] Albino, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 04:33:21] Dave_B_: (as for *why* this happens… can vary from network to network, no real idea what's up. I've found sometimes registering using ip to be more reliable than registering by hostname)
[2014-09-17 04:34:36] Dave_B_: seems to mostly be a sign of misconfig of either the node, the host machine or the network, hence I've never raised it as a bug against the grid stuff, though perhaps there is room for improvement in what a user sees (e.g. don't add a node to the visible list until it's been confirmed)
[2014-09-17 04:36:24] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: I can telnet to/from the specific host/port
[2014-09-17 04:37:45] Dave_B_: yeah I've been able to do that too and still had the issue & resolved it by switching to use ip. Made *no* sense to me
[2014-09-17 04:38:17] Dave_B_: but then i was on borrowed VMs inside a network i didn't own, so decided to leave it at that and not investigate
[2014-09-17 04:38:28] Dave_B_: sorry, had i investigated I might be more use to you right now!

[2014-09-17 08:30:03] WhereIsMySpoon: surely if you have a pipeline that is constantly updatign stuff, therefore has a sizeable chance to be unstable, it should be easy to revert stuff
[2014-09-17 08:30:30] WhereIsMySpoon: thats like subscribing to the unstable branch of debian then locking down the install so you cant uninstall any unstable programs that are crashing your pc

[2014-09-17 08:45:40] Dave_B_: had a bit of an annoying moment after using a comparison tool to make sure some json responses from an API matched what it gave before a change. Turned out the tool would say it matched if you replaced any element with null :(
[2014-09-17 08:45:50] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: lol, nice
[2014-09-17 08:46:13] Dave_B_: was a bit unfortunate :p

[2014-09-17 08:46:26] WhereIsMySpoon: clearly null == <?>
[2014-09-17 08:46:38] Dave_B_: oh, it also was a bit loose with type rules, it thought that 2 and "2" were the same etc

[2014-09-17 09:20:33] jimevans: you can use WebElements as arguments for executeScript. also, if you have javascript that returns elements, you can cast the result to WebElement.

[2014-09-17 09:23:06] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: my first recommendation is to not use phantomjs
[2014-09-17 09:23:12] Andy129837239821: why?
[2014-09-17 09:23:28] WhereIsMySpoon: cause it doesnt provide an accurate user representation of what a user would actually do
[2014-09-17 09:23:34] WhereIsMySpoon: the js engine used is different
[2014-09-17 09:23:44] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: you can't really do that. whatever you put into executeScript is wrapped into an anonymous function and executed. if you want it to return something, you need to actually tell it to return.
[2014-09-17 09:23:54] Andy129837239821: well, i have already used and for my purpose it is working. What i'm trying to do is very simple..
[2014-09-17 09:24:07] Andy129837239821: it also works on IEdrveir and ChromreDriver
[2014-09-17 09:24:07] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: ok, but I recommend against it. What's your problem?

[2014-09-17 09:25:21] Andy129837239821: ok, sorry. So, the thing is i'm currently trying to make a web crwaler to this site -> http://www.fazenda.rj.gov.br/projetoCPS/ . This site returns a huge javascript and this javascript genrates cookies and posts to another page which i need to get
[2014-09-17 09:25:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i ask lots of them
[2014-09-17 09:25:47] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, now im going to make another recommendation, dont use selenium as a web crawler
[2014-09-17 09:26:10] WhereIsMySpoon: but carry on
[2014-09-17 09:26:17] Andy129837239821: I use c# and .net to most of my web crwalers and things just work fine. Now this site has this sort of javascript challenge, and i found out that Selenium with PhantomJs do the job that i need ( to interpret the javascript) , then i get the cookies generated and do the rest
[2014-09-17 09:26:41] Andy129837239821: unitl now, am i clear?
[2014-09-17 09:26:57] WhereIsMySpoon: yes

[2014-09-17 09:28:06] Andy129837239821: good :), acctaully no, in brazil its a site where you see if a company is paying its taxes. Because you cant sell anything to a company that its not paying its taxes. If you do so, you get a fine..

[2014-09-17 09:30:06] Andy129837239821: evertyhing works fine when i'm running the project on my machine, but whenever i deploy this webservice to a server, the call to this page returns the page with the javascripts and they are not interpreted. Why this happens only on server?
[2014-09-17 09:30:31] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: 1) what is this "javascript challenge" 2) what error do you get 3) what selenium coed are you using

[2014-09-17 09:38:48] WhereIsMySpoon: elyezer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541255/selenium-node-hub-configuration look at the question for this, it shows how to config that
[2014-09-17 09:38:50] WhereIsMySpoon: not the answers
[2014-09-17 09:38:51] WhereIsMySpoon: the question
[2014-09-17 09:39:21] Andy129837239821: i'm sort of lost, lol. So, did you understood the issue WhereIsMySpoon?
[2014-09-17 09:39:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821:and it all works fine with normal browsers?
[2014-09-17 09:39:26] WhereIsMySpoon: its just phantomjs that doesnt work?
[2014-09-17 09:39:32] Andy129837239821: yes, normal browser works fines..
[2014-09-17 09:39:50] WhereIsMySpoon: thenj i'd say it's probably becauuse the server on their side checks the thing that is requesting the page
[2014-09-17 09:39:55] Andy129837239821: phantomjs works when i'm running locally , but when i run  under iis it just returns the page..
[2014-09-17 09:39:59] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2014-09-17 09:40:14] WhereIsMySpoon: same version of everything yes/
[2014-09-17 09:40:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-09-17 09:40:18] Andy129837239821: yes
[2014-09-17 09:40:49] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: the normal browsers work fine on the iis too?
[2014-09-17 09:41:07] Andy129837239821: i could not make IEDriver work under iis
[2014-09-17 09:41:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ok chrome or w/e you tried
[2014-09-17 09:41:20] WhereIsMySpoon: ie sucks anyway
[2014-09-17 09:41:27] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2014-09-17 09:41:32] Andy129837239821: agreed
[2014-09-17 09:41:35] WhereIsMySpoon: but chrome works on iis right?

[2014-09-17 09:41:49] jimevans: Andy129837239821: i'm not surprised by that. your iis installation is running as a low-privileged user (or it should be), so it probably can't run IE properly.
[2014-09-17 09:41:50] Andy129837239821: let me see chrome again
[2014-09-17 09:42:10] Andy129837239821: well, i changed iis account runner to a high privileged user just for testing
[2014-09-17 09:42:13] Andy129837239821: and still, did not run
[2014-09-17 09:42:18] elyezer: WhereIsMySpoon: I think my issue is related to having many displays in one screen. I don't know if will be better to create one display per screen, but you have helped. Thanks
[2014-09-17 09:42:25] MattAtL, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 09:42:33] jimevans: Andy129837239821: yes, but did you configure IE's settings *for that user*?
[2014-09-17 09:42:43] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821:did you try setting the user-agent when using phantomjs
[2014-09-17 09:42:46] jimevans: (note, you can't do that without logging in as that user)
[2014-09-17 09:42:49] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe that will help
[2014-09-17 09:43:02] Andy129837239821: how caan i set that with selenium?
[2014-09-17 09:43:04] WhereIsMySpoon: set it to be the same as the chrome user-agent
[2014-09-17 09:43:08] WhereIsMySpoon: http://phantomjs.org/api/webpage/property/settings.html
[2014-09-17 09:43:21] elyezer: WhereIsMySpoon: actually I can run the tests, the problem is that when running more than one job in parallel some process are getting stuck
[2014-09-17 09:43:22] Andy129837239821: i don't think this is the problem. becuase locally it runs just fine..
[2014-09-17 09:43:33] dmborin: how can one force the @driver to look at the DOM again (and again) without refreshing the DOM?  I've got some AJAXy stuff happening that loads a modal after the DOM appears to have completed rendering, and my @driver is being a pain and not "seeing" this new stuff
[2014-09-17 09:43:40] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821:I'd like to eliminate it as an issue
[2014-09-17 09:43:49] Andy129837239821: ok, let me try that
[2014-09-17 09:44:07] Andy129837239821: btw, how can i address an answer to you here(in irc), like you do
[2014-09-17 09:44:09] jimevans: dmborin: can you point to an example page that shows the issue?
[2014-09-17 09:44:09] dmborin: clarify: without doing a browser refresh and thus start the gerbil wheel all over with the modal disappearing for bit
[2014-09-17 09:44:18] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: just type my name
[2014-09-17 09:44:27] dmborin: hey Jim...how's it going :)
[2014-09-17 09:44:32] dmborin: sure...www.livingsocial.com
[2014-09-17 09:44:49] dmborin: jimevans:if you have ever been there before do it in a private/incognito browser
[2014-09-17 09:44:54] jimevans: the initial "modal" page?
[2014-09-17 09:44:55] dmborin: jimevans:doing this in Chrome currently
[2014-09-17 09:45:08] Andy129837239821: WhereIsMySpoon test
[2014-09-17 09:45:19] Andy129837239821: ahh, i understood, what a dumb I am
[2014-09-17 09:45:20] Andy129837239821: lol
[2014-09-17 09:45:30] dmborin: jimevans:a modal should show up about 2 seconds after you load the page, saying "Save on the best of your city"
[2014-09-17 09:45:32] jimevans: dmborin: the initial "modal" that comes up when you visit the home page? it's in an iframe.
[2014-09-17 09:45:47] jimevans: you have to switch to the iframe before the driver can find anything on it.
[2014-09-17 09:45:48] bimmelino, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 09:45:51] dmborin: jimevans:OK...how do I handle that..never had to mokey with that before
[2014-09-17 09:45:56] dmborin: oh, ok
[2014-09-17 09:46:02] WhereIsMySpoon: try not to use iframes
[2014-09-17 09:46:04] jimevans: driver.switch_to_frame
[2014-09-17 09:46:12] WhereIsMySpoon: just a general web programming thing

[2014-09-17 09:46:27] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea what jim said
[2014-09-17 09:46:37] dmborin: jimevans:do I have to give it info on the frame, or will it automagically find it?
[2014-09-17 09:46:37] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: make sure you swithc back to the main window when you wanna do somethinig in there again
[2014-09-17 09:46:47] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: you can pass the id of the iframe
[2014-09-17 09:46:51] dmborin: driver.go_back?
[2014-09-17 09:47:04] WhereIsMySpoon: which appears to be cupcake_iframe
[2014-09-17 09:47:09] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin:no, just switch_to again
[2014-09-17 09:47:12] SwampDragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 09:47:19] WhereIsMySpoon: keep a reference to teh window uid
[2014-09-17 09:47:25] jimevans: dmborin: find the iframe element using find_element, and use driver.switch_to_frame(element). once you're done and the "modal" is dismissed, driver.switch_to_default_content.
[2014-09-17 09:47:35] jimevans: that'll get you back to the top-level frame.
[2014-09-17 09:47:40] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never seen that method before
[2014-09-17 09:47:45] dmborin: excellent
[2014-09-17 09:48:02] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: get used to it. switching to a frame by name is likely to be deprecated.
[2014-09-17 09:48:08] jimevans: (it's ambiguous)
[2014-09-17 09:48:12] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, driver.switchTo().defaultContent()
[2014-09-17 09:48:17] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: and by id?
[2014-09-17 09:48:32] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: which id?
[2014-09-17 09:48:35] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: the iframe id
[2014-09-17 09:48:41] jimevans: define "frame id"
[2014-09-17 09:48:48] WhereIsMySpoon: <iframe id="a">
[2014-09-17 09:48:51] dmborin: is there a separate HTML tag for an iframe?
[2014-09-17 09:48:57] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: <iframe>
[2014-09-17 09:49:14] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: how is that different than finding the element by id, then using the element?
[2014-09-17 09:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: it isnt :) you just said name thast all
[2014-09-17 09:50:17] dmborin: sweet..found it
[2014-09-17 09:50:27] dmborin: jimevans:as always, a pleasure
[2014-09-17 09:50:32] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin:it's your cupcake_iframe one
[2014-09-17 09:50:39] dmborin: Yeah, found it...
[2014-09-17 09:50:40] WhereIsMySpoon: ah you got it
[2014-09-17 09:50:41] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-09-17 09:50:42] dmborin: sweet
[2014-09-17 09:50:57] WhereIsMySpoon: so many iframes on that page...
[2014-09-17 09:51:00] WhereIsMySpoon: :(
[2014-09-17 09:51:07] WhereIsMySpoon: sadface
[2014-09-17 09:51:21] WhereIsMySpoon: they really shouldnt be needed now that we aren't using ie6
[2014-09-17 09:51:41] WhereIsMySpoon: hey ho
[2014-09-17 09:54:07] dmborin: WhereIsMySpoon:I'll let 'em know
[2014-09-17 09:54:27] Andy129837239821: WhereIsMySpoon: Even changed to chrome driver. and still the same problem
[2014-09-17 09:54:32] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: it's quite easy to place elements in layers without using iframes with z ordering
[2014-09-17 09:54:57] WhereIsMySpoon: it's just lazy programming
[2014-09-17 09:54:59] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-09-17 09:55:01] Andy129837239821: WhereIsMySpoon: Locally runs! But when deployed under iis on server the page returned is not processed, it only gets request and returned
[2014-09-17 09:57:11] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821:I can only suggest that there is some environment difference between your browsers on your iis and locally
[2014-09-17 09:57:49] Andy129837239821: yes, i have come to that conclusion too. ANy ideas on how to bypass that javascript challenge?
[2014-09-17 09:57:59] WhereIsMySpoon: unfortunately it's all in italian
[2014-09-17 09:58:02] WhereIsMySpoon: so not really
[2014-09-17 09:58:05] Andy129837239821: its portugues
[2014-09-17 09:58:11] WhereIsMySpoon: spanish even
[2014-09-17 09:58:12] dmborin: jimevans:getting no such method driver.switch_to_frame
[2014-09-17 09:58:21] WhereIsMySpoon: switch_to.frame
[2014-09-17 09:58:23] WhereIsMySpoon: i think
[2014-09-17 09:58:25] dmborin: jimevans:was that pseudocode?  doing ruby here
[2014-09-17 09:58:37] Andy129837239821: lol, portugueses is very different from italian or spanish. But thanks anyway :)
[2014-09-17 09:58:37] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: do a google search for ruby frame selenium switch to
[2014-09-17 09:58:38] jimevans: dmborin: yeah, it's pseudocode.
[2014-09-17 09:58:45] WhereIsMySpoon: Andy129837239821: ok well i dont read either
[2014-09-17 09:58:56] WhereIsMySpoon: so i dont have the foggiest what the code is doing
[2014-09-17 09:59:02] jimevans: Andy129837239821: not so very different. all romance languages, directly descended from latin.
[2014-09-17 09:59:16] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know why i said italian
[2014-09-17 09:59:19] WhereIsMySpoon: i meant spanishj
[2014-09-17 09:59:27] WhereIsMySpoon: but anyway
[2014-09-17 09:59:40] dmborin: LOLZ...on the actual RubyBindings page hahahaha
[2014-09-17 09:59:47] dmborin: could I be a little more RTFM
[2014-09-17 09:59:54] WhereIsMySpoon: dmborin: :)
[2014-09-17 09:59:56] jimevans: but brazilian == portuguese.

[2014-09-17 10:09:18] antsanto: probably I can do by maintaing a list of my own and find the new pid, when driver is created
[2014-09-17 10:10:13] jimevans: the python webdriver library?
[2014-09-17 10:10:25] jimevans: i can't see how that's reliable.

[2014-09-17 10:14:29] antsanto: I have a basic question here, how does new Firefox() opens the broswer?
[2014-09-17 10:14:43] antsanto: I mean does it internally calls the executable?
[2014-09-17 10:15:03] *jimevans hates when people justify stuff by saying "it worked in rc" because of the entirely different architecture.'

[2014-09-17 10:16:27] jimevans: antsanto: yes, the firefox driver does directly launch the firefox browser, so in theory, it would know the process id of the firefox browser. but the fact that it's not cross-browser is a clue why it wouldn't be exposed in the webdriver api.
[2014-09-17 10:17:25] antsanto: Hmmmm..
[2014-09-17 10:18:28] jimevans: because the IE and chrome drivers in the language bindings don't start the browser directly; they launch the driver executable, which is what, in turn, launches the browser.
[2014-09-17 10:18:51] antsanto: Hmm, ya then its tough to track the pid
[2014-09-17 10:19:14] jimevans: not tough, impossible to do reliably. there's always going to be a race condition.
[2014-09-17 10:19:26] antsanto: But how each driver speak to its corresponding broswer, when runs in parallel?
[2014-09-17 10:20:10] jimevans: it depends on the implementation. the IE driver keeps track of the IWebBrowser2 COM objects.
[2014-09-17 10:20:24] jimevans: not sure how chromedriver does it.

[2014-09-17 14:59:13] dionnys: does anyone know of a way to debug the communication between webdriver bindings and firefoxdriver?
[2014-09-17 14:59:22] dionnys: Fiddler does not pick it up
[2014-09-17 14:59:24] amasaamos, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-09-17 14:59:36] jimevans: dionnys: what are you trying to debug?
[2014-09-17 15:00:02] dionnys: we are seeing sporadic HTTP timeout exceptions
[2014-09-17 15:00:18] jimevans: and i think fiddler can if you are able to configure it to proxy traffic to localhost.
[2014-09-17 15:00:38] jimevans: i *thought* there was a way to do it, but i'm probably wrong about that.
[2014-09-17 15:00:52] jimevans: dionnys: in what language bindings?
[2014-09-17 15:00:56] dionnys: .NET
[2014-09-17 15:01:30] jimevans: the traffic across the wire to the firefox extension likely won't tell you much.
[2014-09-17 15:02:53] dionnys: ok, I keep getting failures along the lines of: The HTTP request to the remote WebDriver server for URL http://localhost:7055/hub/session/420dd23b-b0db-483d-863d-7e223d4f597a/element timed out after 60 seconds.
[2014-09-17 15:03:46] dionnys: it happens when my test tries to interact with an element and the page hasn't finished loading yet. I noticed if I put a breakpoint on the failing line and wait for the page to load, then step over the breakpoint, it passes fine.
[2014-09-17 15:04:01] jimevans: yep. and all the wire traffic would tell you is that the bindings sent an http request to the http server inside the webdriver firefox extension, and didn't get a response within 60 seconds.
[2014-09-17 15:04:19] opapo, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-09-17 15:04:34] dionnys: is there a way to debug the JS on the browser sitting within the extension?
[2014-09-17 15:04:40] rodrigomartin1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-17 15:05:19] jimevans: not an easy one, but it should be logging in the browser console.
[2014-09-17 15:06:06] dionnys: ok, i'll see if i can turn on more detailed logging
[2014-09-17 15:06:21] dionnys: thx

[2014-09-17 15:07:15] jimevans: but if the page is legitimately not finished loading, you might need to either increase the command timeout for the driver in the language bindings, or use a page load timeout so that the driver will return earlier
