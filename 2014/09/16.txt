[2014-09-16 01:14:37] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: and how do you define "same node"
[2014-09-16 01:15:05] WhereIsMySpoon: the only way you identify elements in selenium is with a locator
[2014-09-16 01:16:11] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon: For example, do both WebElements refer to the same table cell.
[2014-09-16 01:16:32] CSWookie: I'm not sure I'm understanding your question.
[2014-09-16 01:18:03] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: I think that whatever you're trying to achieve, you may be going about it wrongly, though I may be wrong - WebElements are just a pointer (not a c++ pointer) to an element on a web page. Any WebElement can only be referenced by a locator (id, xpath, css...) therefore the only way to compare them is to compare two locators
[2014-09-16 01:18:12] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: it would help if you give me the full context
[2014-09-16 01:18:28] WhereIsMySpoon: I've never had to compare 2 webelements and I have a fairly extensive framework + tests
[2014-09-16 01:18:39] WhereIsMySpoon: what are you trying to achieve
[2014-09-16 01:19:36] WhereIsMySpoon: if you can give me a link to whatever site you're working on that'd be great too
[2014-09-16 01:20:16] CSWookie: I've written an interpreter that takes a subset of english and generates selenium calls.  I'd like to be able to determine if a particular WebElement has already been found...  I suppose equally good would be if there were a nice way to get the absolute xpath to the element on the page referenced by the WebElement.
[2014-09-16 01:20:49] CSWookie: Possibly better, even.
[2014-09-16 01:21:28] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: so you have something that translates stuff like "Click on the 'Add' button" into driver.findElement(By.linkText("Add")).click() ?
[2014-09-16 01:21:57] CSWookie: Currently it translates to XPath, but yes.
[2014-09-16 01:22:02] WhereIsMySpoon: I suppose you could keep a static link of all By locators you use
[2014-09-16 01:22:08] WhereIsMySpoon: list*
[2014-09-16 01:23:31] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: why do you want to determine if a webelement has already been found?
[2014-09-16 01:24:38] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-16 01:24:54] CSWookie: I would like to be able to teach my interpreter to have an optimization mode.  I'd like for it to be able to look at the webelements used in a given set of commands and determine the best common subset.
[2014-09-16 01:26:30] CSWookie: I'd also like to have it find absolute XPath for a given WebElement, that's probably a more useful thing to optimize.  I figure if the element in the web page does not have an id, an absolute xpath from root is probably next fastest.
[2014-09-16 01:26:59] WhereIsMySpoon: I don't really think this is possible with selenium as is tbh, it ain't designed for this. If you want to optimize, just cache every located WebElement with its relevant By (so then when a location request comes in, you can take the By locator generated and do a quick lookup) but other than that there isn't a lot you can do
[2014-09-16 01:27:25] CSWookie: OK, thanks.
[2014-09-16 01:28:12] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: if you stick around or come back in 6 or 7 hours more people will be on
[2014-09-16 01:28:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ask again then
[2014-09-16 01:28:37] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: why are you making this interpreter?
[2014-09-16 01:29:08] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: if you want something that's easier to use than writing selenium tests in code, consider selenium builder
[2014-09-16 01:29:17] CSWookie: The PHB wants to be able to take it on his laptop and show customers how they can test their own workflows.
[2014-09-16 01:29:23] WhereIsMySpoon: it's the successor to selenium ide
[2014-09-16 01:29:44] CSWookie: Without learning code.
[2014-09-16 01:29:51] WhereIsMySpoon: its basically a record-playback tool
[2014-09-16 01:30:02] WhereIsMySpoon: so you click around on your webpage and it records your clicks, then plays them back
[2014-09-16 01:30:14] WhereIsMySpoon: it's obviously more limited than coding them but is easier to understand and use
[2014-09-16 01:30:34] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie:PHB?
[2014-09-16 01:33:20] CSWookie: Pointy Haired Boss
[2014-09-16 01:34:01] WhereIsMySpoon: I kinda think that creating this interpreter is a bit of a waste of time - just code your tests so that the actual test method is something like this: http://pastie.org/9558222
[2014-09-16 01:34:02] CSWookie: From Dilbert
[2014-09-16 01:34:12] WhereIsMySpoon: This is freakin easy to understand right?
[2014-09-16 01:34:26] WhereIsMySpoon: this is what all of my test methods look like
[2014-09-16 01:34:33] WhereIsMySpoon: each chained method does all of the actual action
[2014-09-16 01:34:52] WhereIsMySpoon: and because of the page object model I'm using each call returns the next page I need to use
[2014-09-16 01:35:18] WhereIsMySpoon: so goFrontPage returns a FrontPage object, which has a goShoppingPage method, which returns a ShoppingPage object...

[2014-09-16 01:36:04] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: each of these Page<Blah> objects represent an actual web page
[2014-09-16 01:36:09] WhereIsMySpoon: or <Blah>page
[2014-09-16 01:36:11] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever you want
[2014-09-16 01:36:29] CSWookie: It's freaking easy for ME to understand, and it's freaking easy for YOU to understand, but it's not going to be freaking easy for the implementors or the help desk people or the lazy-ass devs who don't want to learn.
[2014-09-16 01:37:10] WhereIsMySpoon: and how is an interpreter help this? This is an actual question, not a sarcastic quip
[2014-09-16 01:37:16] WhereIsMySpoon: *how will
[2014-09-16 01:37:41] WhereIsMySpoon: you're going to be showing them lower level stuff than this exposes
[2014-09-16 01:37:52] WhereIsMySpoon: like clicking on elements, waiting for stuff to load, fiddling with dropdown boxes
[2014-09-16 01:38:24] CSWookie: The interpereter allows the test to be lifted directly from the workflow specification.
[2014-09-16 01:38:49] WhereIsMySpoon: So you have a spec that has a defined language and you want to translate the spec's language into selenium tests
[2014-09-16 01:39:10] WhereIsMySpoon: And they don't want to allocate time to have someone spend time doing this?
[2014-09-16 01:39:10] CSWookie: Yes.
[2014-09-16 01:39:43] WhereIsMySpoon: They instead want someone to spend potentially more time writing an interpreter that will probably not produce anywhere near as good tests
[2014-09-16 01:39:49] WhereIsMySpoon: not that thats an attack on you
[2014-09-16 01:40:06] WhereIsMySpoon: just being real here for a moment
[2014-09-16 01:40:08] CSWookie: These sorts of specs get invented on the fly, when the boss starts musing over engineering possibilities in front of customers.
[2014-09-16 01:40:47] CSWookie: So far it's producing about as good of tests... But it sure has taken a lot of time to write.
[2014-09-16 01:41:11] WhereIsMySpoon: Yes, automation is a software dev job and takes time to produce good tests
[2014-09-16 01:41:30] WhereIsMySpoon: It isn't something you can pawn off to random QA people with no coding exp
[2014-09-16 01:41:38] CSWookie: But it's what the boss wants, and he's put a 3000_$ bounty on getting it done.

[2014-09-16 01:42:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Anything more than that which needs proper waits and stuff to synchronise loading pages with actions will fail

[2014-09-16 01:44:11] CSWookie: Yeah, that's going to be an interesting challenge to implement...  But it's what the boss wanted.  I came up with a nice set of decorators an dthings to make the tests in clean python, and he said it wasn't what he wanted.
[2014-09-16 01:44:12] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: like it or not, even using an interpreter is coding

[2014-09-16 11:54:04] jimevans: leibnizzle: hi. and :ask.
[2014-09-16 11:54:04] selbot2__: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2014-09-16 11:55:12] leibnizzle: If I have a page that's continuously updating via javascript, is there a way for Selenium to detect that and tell me about it, apart from me fetching page_source over and over again?
[2014-09-16 11:55:18] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-16 11:55:21] SwampDragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-09-16 11:56:09] jimevans: does the javascript update modify the DOM? in other words, are elements removed and re-added to the DOM?
[2014-09-16 11:57:29] leibnizzle: It's just text updates to the same <td>s each time
[2014-09-16 11:58:20] jimevans: so if the <td> elements aren't getting removed/readded to the DOM, then you could poll for changes in the text of the element, i suppose.
[2014-09-16 11:59:31] leibnizzle: Ok is that basically the same thing as checking the page_source on even intervals?
[2014-09-16 12:00:01] fabrice31, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2014-09-16 12:00:15] jimevans: sort of, except that page source is going to be less accurate than doing findElement on the <td> and looking at the result of getText()
[2014-09-16 12:00:58] jimevans: because parsing page source is a pain, and error-prone.
[2014-09-16 12:01:20] leibnizzle: true true

[2014-09-16 16:03:15] mos6y: yes
[2014-09-16 16:03:21] tourdedave_: I've added my comments to that gist
[2014-09-16 16:04:52] mos6y: thanks I answered some of them
[2014-09-16 16:05:22] mos6y: it is like all my waits implicit or explicit are not obeying the set values
[2014-09-16 16:05:59] jimevans: mos6y: do not mix implicit and explicit waits. ever. full stop.
[2014-09-16 16:07:04] jimevans: please see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164742/combining-implicit-wait-and-explicit-wait-together-results-in-unexpected-wait-ti/15174978#15174978 for an explanation why
[2014-09-16 16:10:52] mos6y: thanks jimevans i will give that a read

[2014-09-16 16:14:33] tourdedave_: Agreed, explicit waits or bust. Also, I'd be wary of using rescues as a retry mechanism when using an explicit wait
[2014-09-16 16:14:53] tourdedave_: I wrote about a more targetted approach here: http://elementalselenium.com/tips/10-retry-test-actions

[2014-09-16 16:45:52] jimevans: talks about why sendkeys are slow for 64-bit IE driver, why screenshots are truncated for 32-bit IE driver, and why it can't be fixed (easily).
