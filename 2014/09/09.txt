[2014-09-09 02:35:25] MauroKTD: cool then, here's my question. My company forces me to automate a webpage using java+IE8, and i can't change settings for the protected mode. If i use the "ignoreProtected" capability, the automating script becomes so much irresponsive it doesn't even get past some of the basic first pages of navigations. Are there any workaround for those settings?
[2014-09-09 02:37:35] WhereIsMySpoon: MauroKTD: do you get this?: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unexpected error launching Internet Explorer. Protected Mode must be set to the same value (enabled or disabled) for all zones. (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
[2014-09-09 02:37:49] WhereIsMySpoon: or is it just a general unresponsiveness
[2014-09-09 02:38:39] stan, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-09 02:39:00] MauroKTD: that would be the exception if i ran the code without "ignoreProtectedMode".  If i manually set all the options to the same level of protections, then i don't get the exception, but the company needs to have those settings as default
[2014-09-09 02:39:50] MauroKTD: with the capability set, the code becomes really irresponsive (as much as even 15 consecutive retries on the same action fail)
[2014-09-09 02:40:06] thuhuecntt: I begin study selenium , and I feel dificult, please help me :(
[2014-09-09 02:40:36] WhereIsMySpoon: thuhuecntt: you need to read the intro tutorials and try it out, we can't just "make" you understand it
[2014-09-09 02:41:32] thuhuecntt: yes, where am I just  read intro tutorials ?
[2014-09-09 02:41:49] WhereIsMySpoon: thuhuecntt: how about you google for them
[2014-09-09 02:41:51] thuhuecntt: please guide for me
[2014-09-09 02:42:07] WhereIsMySpoon: MauroKTD: that is rather unfortunate
[2014-09-09 02:42:18] WhereIsMySpoon: MauroKTD: have you looked at setting INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS ?
[2014-09-09 02:43:08] WhereIsMySpoon: not sure if that does a similar thing to ignoreProtected or not
[2014-09-09 02:43:13] WhereIsMySpoon: but its supposed to help with zoning
[2014-09-09 02:43:24] MauroKTD: yep, "InternetExplorerDriver.INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS" is just a constant field which contains "ignoreProtectedModeSettings"
[2014-09-09 02:43:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ah right
[2014-09-09 02:43:42] thuhuecntt: I just one seminar about selenium
[2014-09-09 02:44:07] MauroKTD: i also tried setting "ieCap.setCapability("initialBrowserUrl",pageUrl);" with "pageUrl" is the starting page for my automated navigation, but nothing changes
[2014-09-09 02:44:12] thuhuecntt: can you help me?
[2014-09-09 02:44:23] WhereIsMySpoon: then there isnt a lot more we can do, you need to go to your manager and explain why you can't get reliable tests because your internal IT policy sucks
[2014-09-09 02:44:34] WhereIsMySpoon: thuhuecntt: not if you dont try to help yourself
[2014-09-09 02:45:06] WhereIsMySpoon: go google some tutorials, look at some sample code, write 1 or 2 tests
[2014-09-09 02:45:07] thuhuecntt: yes,
[2014-09-09 02:45:19] thuhuecntt:  are you have skype?
[2014-09-09 02:45:21] WhereIsMySpoon: nobody here is going to write your tests for you

[2014-09-09 02:45:41] barancev: MauroKTD: you have two options: 1) negotiate to your authorities the need to tune IE properly, 2) introduce flakiness with the "ignoreProtectedModeSettings" capability, choose what you prefer :)
[2014-09-09 02:45:49] thuhuecntt:  I can add   your skype ?
[2014-09-09 02:45:51] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: he tried the latter already :)
[2014-09-09 02:45:56] WhereIsMySpoon: thuhuecntt: are you even listening?
[2014-09-09 02:46:09] barancev: anf the Flakiness happened, as expected
[2014-09-09 02:46:13] WhereIsMySpoon: aye
[2014-09-09 02:46:28] MauroKTD: the corp i'm working for (as an external consultant) is a big one, and has all his tools certified and tested with default settings, and having them change that means they have to certify all their products work in those conditions too
[2014-09-09 02:46:40] thuhuecntt: yes
[2014-09-09 02:46:57] WhereIsMySpoon: thuhuecntt: I. Will not. Give out. Personal contact details.

[2014-09-09 02:48:20] WhereIsMySpoon: Setting protected mode settings to all the same level (say you set them all to be strict or whatever) on your personal pc that you're developiung these tests surely shouldnt be an issue?
[2014-09-09 02:48:38] WhereIsMySpoon: Oh wait, but then they have to run them on their pcs ofc

[2014-09-09 02:49:18] barancev: MauroKTD: this is a technical restriction for selenium, if you obliged to test with this setting -- look for a different tool
[2014-09-09 02:49:33] WhereIsMySpoon: or dont use IE
[2014-09-09 02:49:42] WhereIsMySpoon: but I doubt that's an option :)
[2014-09-09 02:49:43] MauroKTD: my final script will be a product to be run through citrix to a set number of clients
[2014-09-09 02:49:55] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-09-09 02:50:09] WhereIsMySpoon: there isn't really anything we can do to help you with this MauroKTD :(
[2014-09-09 02:50:11] MauroKTD: i guessed it as well, but i hoped there could be a workaround
[2014-09-09 02:50:29] barancev: a workaround is to tune IE properly
[2014-09-09 02:50:59] MauroKTD: don't worry, i'll acknowledge this and tell them about it, you were very kind to answer my questions :)
[2014-09-09 02:51:08] barancev: if these settings affect the functionality of the application under test -- you're unfortunate :)
[2014-09-09 02:51:32] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: it's less that, it's probably just corporate red tape about this stuff
[2014-09-09 02:52:01] MauroKTD: yep, they develop a web app frontend and want some automation over it
[2014-09-09 02:52:25] barancev: testing on a virtual box in an isolated network is a solution for security restrictions
[2014-09-09 02:53:07] WhereIsMySpoon: virtualisation is scary modern technology (tm)

[2014-09-09 07:22:26] HolyGoat: Let me rephrase: I find myself having to use WebdriverWait every time to locate an element after a new page has been loaded, since I cannot assume the element is already there. Is that common, or is it the way to go?
[2014-09-09 07:22:45] SitamJana, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-09 07:23:25] ato: How do you mean that's an antipattern?
[2014-09-09 07:23:57] ato: WebDriver generally has a blocking API which means it will return from get when document.readyState == "completed".
[2014-09-09 07:24:34] ato: If you have elements that are added to the DOM after that state changes, you have yourself a race condition which explicit waits are used to deal with.
[2014-09-09 07:24:41] HolyGoat: ato: Well, having to make an exception to the normal flow of things every time I navigate to a new page seems wrong. Even though it somewhat makes sense of course
[2014-09-09 07:25:06] ato: How wrong?
[2014-09-09 07:25:13] HolyGoat: I see, I didn't know that. I'll have to look into that further, thanks. It might be just this pesky GWT application I'm dealing with
[2014-09-09 07:25:26] barancev: ha! GWT!

[2014-09-09 07:25:39] HolyGoat: barancev: It's a nightmare :(
[2014-09-09 07:25:41] barancev: it's all dynamic like hell
[2014-09-09 07:25:44] ato: You can use Selenium's concept of implicit waits which will essentially wait for a certain duration when looking up any element.
[2014-09-09 07:26:11] ato: So at every find_element it will wait for n duration, which of course some times is not what you want.
[2014-09-09 07:26:12] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: I have created a small library of waitClickableThenClick, waitClickableThenSelect, waitVisibleThenSendText...etc that take a By or WebElement
[2014-09-09 07:26:16] WhereIsMySpoon: and a time to wait
[2014-09-09 07:26:18] HolyGoat: ato: Ah yes, I've looked into that, but I'm using Selenium in a slightly different context (monitoring)
[2014-09-09 07:26:39] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: That sounds useful! Is there a Python port? :)
[2014-09-09 07:26:40] ato: Right, then a wrapper seems like what you want.
[2014-09-09 07:26:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that way I dont have to write a wait every time, I can just use these methos I've created
[2014-09-09 07:26:50] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: no, this is self-written code that is proprietary to me :)
[2014-09-09 07:26:52] ato: HolyGoat: Look at the expected_conditions module.
[2014-09-09 07:27:02] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt exactly complicated
[2014-09-09 07:27:16] HolyGoat: ato: I do wrap these calls to a certain extent, but just for convenience
[2014-09-09 07:27:26] WhereIsMySpoon: just using WebDriverWait and expected conditions together
[2014-09-09 07:27:51] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: Right, I do a similar thing in my (small) monitoring module
[2014-09-09 07:27:58] HolyGoat: It's on github, but nowhere near finished
[2014-09-09 07:28:22] WhereIsMySpoon: and by "to me" I mean "to the company" ofc ^^
[2014-09-09 07:28:39] barancev: waitVisibleThenSendText(bySomeLocator, text) == wait.until(visibilityOfElementLocated(bySomeLocator)).sendKeys(text)
[2014-09-09 07:28:45] antsanto: HolyGoat If your using Groovy, you can use delegate concepts, which will delegates all webdriver calls to delegate
[2014-09-09 07:28:55] barancev: I prefer the right side of this equation
[2014-09-09 07:29:08] barancev: it is more explicit
[2014-09-09 07:29:14] antsanto: in delegate u can handle all waits. So that they are in single place
[2014-09-09 07:29:23] HolyGoat: antsanto: I'm using Python, but I can do similar tricks there too
[2014-09-09 07:29:37] antsanto: HolyGoat yes . .
[2014-09-09 07:30:47] HolyGoat: thanks for all your input everyone, this has provided some clarity for me
[2014-09-09 07:31:29] antsanto: Why pagefactory class been rewritten to support or handle stale element excpetion?
[2014-09-09 07:31:39] antsanto: I always wonder that
[2014-09-09 07:31:45] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: In general, for web testing, selenium is all about doing something, then waiting for something to change
[2014-09-09 07:31:59] WhereIsMySpoon: that isn't an antipattern, it's just how normal flow of web apps is
[2014-09-09 07:32:09] selbot2___: 04 Open issues: 817
[2014-09-09 07:32:15] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: I do understand that, I shouldn't have phrased it like that.
[2014-09-09 07:32:32] barancev: please note that selenium is The Base Level Tool, that's why it is so simple
[2014-09-09 07:32:46] barancev: and, yes, extensions and wrappers are welcome
[2014-09-09 07:33:29] barancev: even better if you can create an extension to deal with GWT specific widgets and share it to the world
[2014-09-09 07:33:36] HolyGoat: I might wrap a few things for convenience. Basically I'm writing a Python module that can be used to instantly create Nagios plugins off. I wrote one for Selenium RC before, but this one is based on Selenium 2/Webdriver
[2014-09-09 07:33:50] HolyGoat: (both versions are open source already)
[2014-09-09 07:34:22] WhereIsMySpoon: I would happily share my library, but that would not really guarantee I have much of a job if I go around sharing code that I created for the company :P
[2014-09-09 07:34:25] antsanto: barancev  This is what I was thinking. PageFactory is handling the @findby and calling findElement. What if it holds the startegy and retries in case of errors? I can see pageFactory is giving away that.
[2014-09-09 07:34:33] HolyGoat: I'm a little hesitant towards sharing the project with you guys already, as I'm not entirely satisfied with the design
[2014-09-09 07:34:53] WhereIsMySpoon: even if it is quite a simple one
[2014-09-09 07:35:02] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: I wouldn't worry about that :)
[2014-09-09 07:35:11] antsanto: barancev what you mean by GWt?

[2014-09-09 07:35:26] WhereIsMySpoon: "in the large"?
[2014-09-09 07:35:28] WhereIsMySpoon: wut
[2014-09-09 07:35:31] barancev: antsanto: if an element is stale, the default pagefactory implementation will search again usnig the same locator. what would you expect instead?

[2014-09-09 07:35:53] barancev: GWT is Google Widget Toolkit
[2014-09-09 07:36:01] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: well as long as you keep in mind it's work in progress and the api might be subject to change in the near future, here it is: https://github.com/objectified/selmon
[2014-09-09 07:37:12] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: so this is used for monitoring the response time of websites?
[2014-09-09 07:37:15] HolyGoat: I should have wrapped the driver instead of providing convenience methods in my own class, which is something I'm working on when I have time
[2014-09-09 07:37:15] antsanto: barancev: Is it so? I can't see it in the source code, where its actually retrying in case of stale
[2014-09-09 07:37:34] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, and also to test them (so they can generate warning/critical states)
[2014-09-09 07:37:39] WhereIsMySpoon: I see
[2014-09-09 07:37:48] WhereIsMySpoon: All of my tests are purely functional
[2014-09-09 07:38:00] WhereIsMySpoon: as in they test functionality
[2014-09-09 07:38:08] WhereIsMySpoon: not functional programming
[2014-09-09 07:38:15] HolyGoat: it works pretty well, we have 6 Selenium monitoring machines which are controlled from a somewhat large Nagios cluster
[2014-09-09 07:38:39] WhereIsMySpoon: nice
[2014-09-09 07:38:56] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: That is absolutely the most natural thing to use Selenium for :)
[2014-09-09 07:39:28] barancev: antsanto: ah, sorry, I misunderstood your point
[2014-09-09 07:39:49] barancev: you mean "the element became stale after it was found but before it is used"
[2014-09-09 07:39:54] antsanto: barancev Thats fine. I thought I was wrong here.
[2014-09-09 07:39:56] barancev: yes, this case is not handled
[2014-09-09 07:40:09] antsanto: barancev yes your right now
[2014-09-09 07:40:19] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: good thing is, I'm a dev myself, so I can change the source code if necessary so that the tests are more reliable/better/the html is sane
[2014-09-09 07:40:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-09-09 07:41:01] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: I'd like to use selenium in the way it's meant for one day :)
[2014-09-09 07:41:37] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-09-09 07:42:55] antsanto: Is safari driver developer is over here?
[2014-09-09 07:43:37] WhereIsMySpoon: doubt it
[2014-09-09 07:44:35] antsanto: or if matters. any one knows how to handle this? Safari fileupload doesnt work. What i thought of doing is creating a mac service which is wirtten in applescript which ll do the file upload process. Now in safari people can call this service so thay file upload works as hack. Any ideas wil be great for me
[2014-09-09 07:45:21] antsanto: I thought of calling this service from the safari web driver extension ( provided we can do so )
[2014-09-09 07:45:42] antsanto: WhereIsMySpoon by any means I can get in touch with him?
[2014-09-09 07:47:45] WhereIsMySpoon: antsanto: not on irc
[2014-09-09 07:48:00] WhereIsMySpoon: you can try submitting a bug report with a fix to safaridriver
[2014-09-09 07:48:21] WhereIsMySpoon: well, he may be on irc, I doubt he's just going to hand out his personal contact details
[2014-09-09 07:48:23] antsanto: WhereIsMySpoon yes sure will do that.
[2014-09-09 07:48:24] WhereIsMySpoon: or she
[2014-09-09 07:49:11] antsanto: hmmmm I guess atoato knows him. I asked him, at seleconf. So ato is the right person to ask his details
[2014-09-09 07:49:46] ato: jleyba is the maintainer.  He sometimes hangs around here.
[2014-09-09 07:50:00] WhereIsMySpoon: oh is he?
[2014-09-09 07:50:11] WhereIsMySpoon: I wasnt aware jley did that
[2014-09-09 07:50:23] ato: My guess is that an AppleScript implementation isn't going to be accepted for the driver itself because it needs to keep working as a remote driver.
[2014-09-09 07:50:28] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2014-09-09 07:50:53] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2014-09-09 07:50:59] ato: Since such a thing needs to be implemented on the local language binding end, and it won't work with a remote, I'm not sure they'll accept it either.
[2014-09-09 07:51:14] ato: But releasing a plugin which can work with a web element might be worth it.
[2014-09-09 07:51:20] ato: s/plugin/library/
[2014-09-09 07:51:36] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe something that can go in support
[2014-09-09 07:51:39] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!
[2014-09-09 07:51:39] antsanto: ato No it should worj as far I'm concerned. Because the service which I was saying will reside in the machine where Safari runs. So it should work

[2014-09-09 07:52:23] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^
[2014-09-09 07:52:33] antsanto: WhereIsMySpoon ya going to support is good idea
[2014-09-09 07:53:02] WhereIsMySpoon: although...that'd be something browser specific inside selenium
[2014-09-09 07:53:07] WhereIsMySpoon: so that probnably wouldnt work either
[2014-09-09 07:53:07] antsanto: Yes :)
[2014-09-09 07:53:22] antsanto: ato Thanks ato for that :)
[2014-09-09 07:54:20] antsanto: WhereIsMySpoon probably. . . I need to write a poc for it and share them. Sadly I'm not an experinced in applescript.

[2014-09-09 08:16:56] Cerz: WhereIsMySpoon: You're clearly not automating right!
[2014-09-09 08:17:08] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: cassandra.apache.org
[2014-09-09 08:17:28] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: the first paragraph is full of marketing bullcrap
[2014-09-09 08:17:31] Cerz: WhereIsMySpoon: You just need to get a subway reciept and automate their survey for a free cookie, get a reciept for your free cookie (repeat)
[2014-09-09 08:17:33] WhereIsMySpoon: not a good start
[2014-09-09 08:18:10] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: I never really read it :) it's quite good though
[2014-09-09 08:18:11] WhereIsMySpoon: HolyGoat: ok the front page tells me nothing about what it -actually- is
[2014-09-09 08:18:37] WhereIsMySpoon: is it a db engine?
[2014-09-09 08:19:01] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2014-09-09 08:19:06] cgoldberg: cassandra is column based nosql data store
[2014-09-09 08:19:11] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-09-09 08:19:26] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt even mention databases
[2014-09-09 08:19:41] WhereIsMySpoon: the only place it even refers to them by a tangent is where it says "Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes"
[2014-09-09 08:19:49] HolyGoat: the wikipedia page might be even more informative, I agree: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra
[2014-09-09 08:20:15] cgoldberg: it's not relational, which many people associate with data "base"... so data "store" is prob better terminology
[2014-09-09 08:20:59] jimevans: ato: if you decide to push a release, let me know, and i'll push the IE driver binaries, and the .NET bindings at your pleasure.
[2014-09-09 08:21:03] WhereIsMySpoon: cgoldberg: like mongo?
[2014-09-09 08:21:07] cgoldberg: but the very first sentence mentions database
[2014-09-09 08:21:34] cgoldberg: WhereIsMySpoon, sorta like mongo.. but mongo is document data sdtore
[2014-09-09 08:22:25] coreyg, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-09 08:22:41] cgoldberg: WhereIsMySpoon ... there's lots of choices in non-relational db's.. each sorta fills a unique niche
[2014-09-09 08:23:01] HolyGoat: that's what constantly confuses people
[2014-09-09 08:23:13] HolyGoat: they don't know what problem to solve with what
[2014-09-09 08:23:18] cgoldberg: unlike relational db's.. where you can sorta grab postgres and be all set for anything

[2014-09-09 08:24:10] cgoldberg: HolyGoat, and to confuse people even more, you can use postgres (or other large db engine) and treat it like nosql k-v store :)
[2014-09-09 08:24:30] HolyGoat: cgoldberg: yeah, or even oracle nowadays :)
[2014-09-09 08:24:34] cgoldberg: ick
[2014-09-09 08:24:46] WhereIsMySpoon: cgoldberg: well you can do the same with mysql
[2014-09-09 08:24:48] HolyGoat: hey now, I'm not using it
[2014-09-09 08:25:03] cgoldberg: HolyGoat, i just despise oracle
[2014-09-09 08:25:09] HolyGoat: cgoldberg: same here
[2014-09-09 08:25:26] cgoldberg: what they did to Sun was disgraceful... and i hated them *long* before that :)
[2014-09-09 08:25:56] HolyGoat: yes they really screwed up that one
[2014-09-09 08:26:48] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: there's usually more to it though, like how Redis is a key/value store, but a really, really fast one that can easily be used as e.g. a queue
[2014-09-09 08:27:03] cgoldberg: i just assume everyone uses sqlite or postgres these days for regular db stuff.. i forgot so many shops are hooked into oracle and that whole scam
[2014-09-09 08:27:33] cgoldberg: HolyGoat, I've been using Swift (OpenStack's data store), it's hella fast
[2014-09-09 08:27:34] WhereIsMySpoon: cgoldberg: i've only worked with mysql
[2014-09-09 08:27:39] WhereIsMySpoon: and mongo a bit
[2014-09-09 08:27:41] HolyGoat: WhereIsMySpoon: it seems that more and more people take the route where they provision key/value stores as for example read caches, because of their speed

[2014-09-09 08:28:34] cgoldberg: oh man.. ive worked with every db you can name i think... in old days Oracle and Sybase and large proprietary relational db's were the rage
[2014-09-09 08:28:59] cgoldberg: HolyGoat, object storage/persistence/caching
[2014-09-09 08:29:32] HolyGoat: cgoldberg: was the emphasis on read or write? or both? and was it your primary datastore?

[2014-09-09 11:14:56] Unode: hi everyone
[2014-09-09 11:15:27] Unode: I'm trying to write some browser tests using python, selenium and phantomjs.
[2014-09-09 11:15:55] Unode: Everything is going fine, but I'm now having problems and I'm not sure it I hit a limitation or something is not working.
[2014-09-09 11:17:02] Unode: The website I'm testing relies a lot in javascript to open floating divs as dialogs but also uses javascript's alert like boxes for confirmation.
[2014-09-09 11:17:23] Unode: The one I'm having problems with is a OK/Cancel alert box.
[2014-09-09 11:17:44] jimevans: Unode: if it's a javascript alert, you'll have trouble using phantomjs.
[2014-09-09 11:18:43] Unode: I'm trying to use the switch_to.alert.accept() but is failing. Using alert_is_present() also doesn't seem to work. And when I try to do a screenshot I don't see any ok/cancel dialog.
[2014-09-09 11:19:10] jimevans: Unode: right. let's think about that for a minute.
[2014-09-09 11:19:13] Unode: jimevans, can you explain what is the problem with phantomjs ?
[2014-09-09 11:19:34] Unode: It's true that I haven't tried other engines yet.
[2014-09-09 11:19:36] jimevans: the driver implementation in phantomjs is exclusively a javascript implementation.
[2014-09-09 11:19:51] jimevans: what happens to the UI thread when javascript executes a modal alert?
[2014-09-09 11:19:59] Unode: :s blocks?
[2014-09-09 11:20:03] jimevans: indeed.
[2014-09-09 11:20:37] Unode: jimevans, any suggestion for workarounds or alternative engines that could behave better?
[2014-09-09 11:20:39] jimevans: since the phantomjs implementation is entirely in javascript, there's no way to simulate that.
[2014-09-09 11:20:52] jimevans: Unode: not "headless" ones, no.
[2014-09-09 11:20:57] Unode: darn...
[2014-09-09 11:20:57] jimevans: use a full browser.
[2014-09-09 11:21:15] Unode: and here I was thinking that headless was going to save the day :D
[2014-09-09 11:22:20] Unode: back to firefox/chrome in a xvfb session.
[2014-09-09 11:22:25] jimevans: honestly, if you're simulating a user visiting your site, the use cases for using a headless browser drop down to nearly non-existent.
[2014-09-09 11:22:37] jimevans: (with webdriver, that is)
[2014-09-09 11:23:09] Unode: jimevans, I'm mostly trying to write small tests to verify that the system is up and running as responding as expected.
[2014-09-09 11:23:23] Unode: *and responding
[2014-09-09 11:23:48] farlan1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-09 11:24:27] jimevans: if it relies on being able to handle javascript alerts vs. "modal" divs, it doesn't sound like those are "small" tests at all.
[2014-09-09 11:25:54] Unode: jimevans, yeah... the login and logout is already non trivial. Lots of clicky clicky with javascript magic. Not much I can do about that unless I GET/POST directly to the apropriate URLs
[2014-09-09 11:26:20] cristi, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-09 11:26:24] jimevans: right. my point is that tests using webdriver can only rarely be classified as "small".
[2014-09-09 11:26:42] Unode: but then I could get this going with something a lot more basic like mechanize that doesn't need to do javascript.
[2014-09-09 11:27:11] jimevans: indeed. and that's often a much better approach for unit-level or some integration-level testing.
[2014-09-09 11:27:13] Unode: jimevans, I see your point
[2014-09-09 11:27:40] Unode: thanks for all the insight
[2014-09-09 11:27:44] jimevans: np
[2014-09-09 11:27:48] jimevans: glad to help.

[2014-09-09 11:51:32] lukeis: i think it is
[2014-09-09 11:51:43] AutomatedTester: doh
[2014-09-09 11:51:55] lukeis: 3 total failures… 1 of those, not an issue, 2 are
[2014-09-09 11:52:13] lukeis: the 2 is "one" test, run in both native events and synthesized events
