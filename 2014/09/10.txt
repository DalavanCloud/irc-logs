[2014-09-10 05:43:28] hefest: what would be the way to speed up tests written in java by using the same browser/webdriver for multiple tests instead of spawning browser for each test?
[2014-09-10 05:45:09] barancev: the answer is in the question :)
[2014-09-10 05:45:11] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-10 05:45:21] hefest: barancev: yes, but how?
[2014-09-10 05:45:40] barancev: just use the same browser+driver
[2014-09-10 05:46:01] hefest: barancev: but if the test ends with close() it will kill the browser
[2014-09-10 05:46:14] hefest: barancev: if there is no close() test will hang until it timeouts
[2014-09-10 05:46:15] barancev: so don't close, reuse it
[2014-09-10 05:46:26] barancev: what timeout do you mean?
[2014-09-10 05:46:40] andy_seit: Quick question.  Against IE9 we use capabillities.SetCapability("ie.ensureCleanSession", "true"); and everything's hunky dory.  Against IE10, that capability causes all tests to fail with "command line server for the IE driver has stopped working".  Taking out the capability resolves the problem.  Does anyone know off hand if that's just unnecessary for IE10, or do we have to go about cleanup in another manner?
[2014-09-10 05:48:13] hefest: barancev: hmm looks like test finished with the browser hanging in the background. great.
[2014-09-10 05:49:34] hefest: barancev: but if i start another test its spawning another browser an leave it hanging in the background
[2014-09-10 05:49:57] barancev: don't span another browser, reuse already started one

[2014-09-10 05:51:04] hefest: barancev: how can i reuse it? how can i control that from webdriver
[2014-09-10 05:53:04] barancev: just reuse the same driver object in all your tests
[2014-09-10 05:53:51] hefest: not sure if thats possible with junit but should be with testng

[2014-09-10 07:34:08] mustafij: how can i solve this issue
[2014-09-10 07:34:08] antsanto: can you get some information of the dom using getAttirbute?
[2014-09-10 07:34:33] mustafij: with innerhtm;
[2014-09-10 07:34:36] antsanto: like getAttribute('class') like this
[2014-09-10 07:34:43] mustafij: let me try
[2014-09-10 07:34:58] antsanto: ya i
[2014-09-10 07:35:35] antsanto: and I also not sure about xpaths very much. your html code has space in the class name in ur java code itsnt probably thats the issue?
[2014-09-10 07:35:53] mustafij: thats not an issue
[2014-09-10 07:36:09] mustafij: because i tried with tbody style=''
[2014-09-10 07:36:18] mustafij: then also its printed empty
[2014-09-10 07:37:14] antsanto: how about getAttribut returning? is it give the righy info about dom

[2014-09-10 07:44:39] mustafij: basically print is not my fact. my fact is i need to check checkbox by mapping with 2nd column data. in that case i need to get table data to find 2nd column data.

[2014-09-10 08:24:21] andy_seit: jimevans: Hey Jim, quick question.  If I use ie.ensurecleansession capability on IE9 it works fine, but if I try it on IE10 I get a "command line server for the IE driver has stopped working" crash when initialising the remotewebdriver.  If I take the capability out, it works fine.  I was wondering if this is not necessary for IE10, or if theres another way we need to go about clearing IE state between instances?

[2014-09-10 08:39:49] antsanto: (antsanto) Hi people . If I'm running the test cases locally using Junit, is it possbile to get the driver logs? I mean debug logs
[2014-09-10 08:40:37] lukeis: there's driver.manage().logs() or something like that
[2014-09-10 08:40:55] ato: driver.manage().options().logs() I think.
[2014-09-10 08:40:59] ato: Some great API design there.
[2014-09-10 08:41:14] antsanto: ato thanks.
[2014-09-10 08:41:25] antsanto: Is it possible to see the logs at browser side?
[2014-09-10 08:41:36] ato: I don't understand the question.
[2014-09-10 08:41:46] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 819
[2014-09-10 08:41:48] ato: Define “see” and “browser”.
[2014-09-10 08:41:54] lukeis: if you watch your tests quickly? ;)
[2014-09-10 08:42:23] lukeis: "logs" are ambiguous here, there's lots of different logs happening
[2014-09-10 08:42:30] ato: Yes, was about to say.
[2014-09-10 08:42:37] ato: And it's only supported by some drivers.
[2014-09-10 08:42:44] Machtyn, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2014-09-10 08:43:07] ato: In theory the remote server should intercept and add its logs before returning them to the client
[2014-09-10 08:43:10] ato: But I don't think that happens.
[2014-09-10 08:43:19] dimacus: jimevans: do you have an example of a simple selenium test written in .NET? I just want to run it on a windows box to say hit google, to start getting used to language syntaxes
[2014-09-10 08:43:25] dimacus: also a python example would rule
[2014-09-10 08:44:24] antsanto: ato Hmm thanks :) will try them

[2014-09-10 08:48:04] jimevans: andy_seit: sorry to take so long getting back to you. no, you need the capability to clean the session properly. is it remote only? or does it happen with local IE driver too?
[2014-09-10 08:48:19] lukeis: be glad there's *so many* php bindings that there isn't php listed ;)
[2014-09-10 08:48:30] antsanto: ato I was mentioning the debug logs , which can been seen in browsers console.
[2014-09-10 08:50:32] ato: dimacus: One in Ruby: https://gist.github.com/jarib/2336427
[2014-09-10 08:50:47] dimacus: yeah ruby one is easy i got that :)
[2014-09-10 08:51:05] dimacus: i'm trying to translate all of my code examples from ruby to other languages
[2014-09-10 08:51:05] ato: antsanto: The console logs can be fetched through the interface lukeis mentioned if it's supported by the browser.
[2014-09-10 08:52:03] andy_seit: jimevans: No problem.  We don't do local runs as a rule so I've only seen it with RemoteWebDriver (to grid and saucelabs - though its very intermittent on sauce).  I can give it a try locally though.
[2014-09-10 08:53:03] jimevans: andy_seit: that'd help.
[2014-09-10 08:53:13] jimevans: or it'd be a good data point anyway.

[2014-09-10 09:00:02] andy_seit: (and just to confirm, it's 100% reproducible when firing on the grid) if this isn't ringing any blatant alarm bells for you, I imagine I've probably messed up somewhere.
[2014-09-10 09:00:35] jimevans: no, it's not ringing any bells. odd though, because the java bindings should be handing off directly to the IE driver server at that point.
[2014-09-10 09:01:00] jimevans: unless there's a timeout/process monitor in java/something else getting in the way.

[2014-09-10 10:32:20] jimevans: oh, yeah. narayan is the guy behind sahi.
[2014-09-10 10:32:21] jimevans: right.
[2014-09-10 10:33:05] nirvdrum: I'm not familiar with it.
[2014-09-10 10:33:26] barancev: and he is right to some extent
[2014-09-10 10:33:32] nirvdrum: But I don't think my statement was an attack on his tool per se.  And if he's doing browser automation, he's going to have to adopt WebDriver.
[2014-09-10 10:33:38] barancev: selenium is not the tool for end users
[2014-09-10 10:33:52] jimevans: nirvdrum: it was open-source at one time, has gone commercial. uses "positional" locators, among other things.

[2014-09-10 10:34:14] barancev: they want a recorder, an object repository, IDE integration and other whistles
[2014-09-10 10:34:19] nirvdrum: I don't care if you write a wrapper around it.  But not using WebDriver probably means heartache.
[2014-09-10 10:34:33] jimevans: if you're doing browser automation tools (commercial or open-source), and you're not based on webdriver, you're behind the curve.
[2014-09-10 10:35:07] barancev: yes, WebDriver will be inside every tool soon
[2014-09-10 10:35:24] barancev: but the thesis about "solving used problems" is correct too
[2014-09-10 10:35:35] barancev: users don't care what is inside

[2014-09-10 10:44:14] AutomatedTester: Selenium can work with svg
[2014-09-10 10:44:19] nirvdrum: barancev: I added a comment to update my answer.
[2014-09-10 10:44:19] AutomatedTester: if that is your question
[2014-09-10 10:44:37] Guest49840: How
[2014-09-10 10:44:45] jarib: jimevans: your blog post mentions that the user needs 2.43.0 to try the Microsoft impl. are there changes needed in the language bindings to support it?
[2014-09-10 10:44:54] jimevans: some.
[2014-09-10 10:44:54] Guest49840: Any api to lookup canvas
[2014-09-10 10:45:07] jimevans: jarib: i consider it experimental.
[2014-09-10 10:45:19] Guest49840: What are they
[2014-09-10 10:45:31] AutomatedTester: Guest49840: can you ask exactly what you are after because I feel this is going to take a long time if we carry on like this
[2014-09-10 10:45:47] AutomatedTester: what part of high charts do you want to test?
[2014-09-10 10:45:49] jarib: jimevans: ok. let me know if there's something i should add to the ruby bindings
[2014-09-10 10:45:50] jimevans: jarib: if you have a "driver service" class, add the ability to pass "—implementation=VENDOR" on the IEDriverServer command line.

[2014-09-10 10:46:15] jarib: i see
[2014-09-10 10:46:17] jimevans: however, their version of the wire protocol isn't exactly compatible with the existing language bindings.
[2014-09-10 10:46:47] Guest49840: Evrything
[2014-09-10 10:46:57] jimevans: most notably, they look for an "id" property instead of an "ELEMENT" property in serializing elements.
[2014-09-10 10:47:05] farlan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-09-10 10:47:12] jimevans: because that's what the spec says.

[2014-09-10 10:47:45] AutomatedTester: Guest49840: you can use the interactions api like click() and sendKeys() and then you can run javascript through executeScript()

[2014-09-10 13:19:45] machtyn: I've got a sign in page I'm trying to test.  The following works in Se IDE: click | css=button:contains(Sign In)
[2014-09-10 13:19:55] lukeis: barancev: i can't reproduce 7850
[2014-09-10 13:20:07] machtyn: However, in C#, using WebDriver and NUnit, I get a "bad Selector" error
[2014-09-10 13:20:21] machtyn: with driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("button:contains(Sign In)")).Click();
[2014-09-10 13:20:31] smccarthy: contains isnt a valid css for all browsers, is it ?
[2014-09-10 13:20:49] smccarthy: any time I want to find an element via text, I use xpath
[2014-09-10 13:22:25] machtyn: You're right.  Looking at my rosetta stone of  XPath, CSS, etc.  I see that CSS2 supports the :contains but CSS3 does not. Well that's a huge bummer. A lot of my Se IDE scripts rely on contains
[2014-09-10 13:23:32] machtyn: Ok, not a lot. But a significant amount that I'm going to have to think differently about some selectors.
[2014-09-10 13:27:16] dimacus: smccarthy: yeah i belive it is due to video recording, since it has to pull in a crap load of video libraries :(
[2014-09-10 13:28:27] jimevans: machtyn: your rosetta stone is incorrect. :contains is not supported by any CSS standard.
[2014-09-10 13:29:23] jimevans: it was introduced by the css selector engine used by jquery, called sizzle. selenium rc (and by extension, selenium ide) used to inject sizzle into the page, hence deceiving everyone into thinking :contains is supported.

[2014-09-10 13:31:03] AutomatedTester: in retrospect that addition wasnt a good idea

[2014-09-10 13:32:25] machtyn: Yeah, the inclusion of JQuery has bit me twice today.  First in Firebug's console (which uses Sizzle) while trying to use :visible and :hidden.  Then just now with the :contains.

[2014-09-10 15:38:03] lukeis: then you could right click on it and 'run' it
[2014-09-10 15:38:34] lukeis: but honestly, python or ruby are much better suited to 'automate' browsers with selenium, rather than java
