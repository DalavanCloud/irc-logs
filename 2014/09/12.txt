[2014-09-12 00:15:25] barancev: selenium asks the system "what's the current hostname", and what the system returns is sent

[2014-09-12 00:15:55] barancev: usually it returns the first alias for 127.0.0.1

[2014-09-12 00:16:16] barancev: me too :)
[2014-09-12 00:16:33] raamp: agreed but sometimes it goes for first alais sometimes second alias

[2014-09-12 01:28:07] raamp: yeah
[2014-09-12 01:28:21] raamp: i know what it is running on but not sure how that alias is picked
[2014-09-12 01:28:33] raamp: some say the first one, but thats not correct in my case
[2014-09-12 01:29:10] WhereIsMySpoon: ah ok :) ato are you maybe able to provide some insight on this, or know who could?

[2014-09-12 01:37:22] raamp: local mcs
[2014-09-12 01:37:32] raamp: we ahve adifferent concept for ci
[2014-09-12 01:37:34] barancev: raamp: we use apache httpclient, and if you want to get know how exactly does it get this info -- you have to read its code
[2014-09-12 01:37:44] raamp: so all tests are locally run
[2014-09-12 01:38:09] raamp: yeah
[2014-09-12 01:38:37] raamp: but what i really want to know is how http client picks up which alias
[2014-09-12 01:38:58] ato: God I hate the Selenium server.
[2014-09-12 01:38:59] barancev: we do new HttpClientFactory().getHttpClient() and this httpclient does its job
[2014-09-12 01:39:03] WhereIsMySpoon: raamp: if you can't figure it out from the docs, maybe go to ##java and they can at least direct you somewhere useful if not tell you
[2014-09-12 01:39:05] raamp: as i have same hosts file but sometimes it picks up localhost sometimes localhost.localdomain
[2014-09-12 01:39:12] barancev: ato: it is not about server
[2014-09-12 01:39:38] barancev: selenium client libs talk to the drivers over http
[2014-09-12 01:39:54] barancev: even if one runs them locally

[2014-09-12 01:41:44] raamp: but yes, the problem is why si ther eis no consistent behaviour accross  differenct m/c s

[2014-09-12 01:42:02] WhereIsMySpoon: what's an m/c?
[2014-09-12 01:42:05] barancev: because programming is hard :)

[2014-09-12 01:50:28] raamp: barancev In order to allow connections from aliases other than "localhost" one have to start FirefoxDriver with a tuned profile:  FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(); profile.setPreference(FirefoxProfile.ALLOWED_HOSTS_PREFERENCE, "alias1,alias2"); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);  The fix will be released in version 2.43

[2014-09-12 03:32:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: do you know why if I run my tests just as JUnit tests without any hub or node, my System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/location") works but if I run a hub locally, run a node locally then run the test, it says that the path to the executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property?
[2014-09-12 03:33:32] barancev: you have to set this property when you start a node

[2014-09-12 10:23:16] jimevans: lb5tr: once again, that's not a protocol issue. the api should hide whatever protocol is being used as an implementation detail. now, remember, you're the one who brought up the protocol. if it's the webdriver api you have issues with, then we should talk about that instead.
[2014-09-12 10:23:23] AutomatedTester: lb5tr: the problem is not the automation, it's that each UI group wants their thing
[2014-09-12 10:23:47] jimevans: unless you're using a language binding that (improperly, imo) exposes the raw protocol to your code.
[2014-09-12 10:23:57] AutomatedTester: Angular uses different idioms to Ember who use different idioms to Dojo

[2014-09-12 10:25:10] jimevans: you *don't* need the 32-bit version of the OS. i'd love to see your source for that.
[2014-09-12 10:25:32] jimevans: however, i usually recommend that people use the 32-bit version of the *driver executable*.
[2014-09-12 10:25:50] jimevans: but that's for 10 and 11.
[2014-09-12 10:26:07] lb5tr: jimevans: so, assuming full cooperation of andorid developers and ios developers and wp developers and whoever, you think there's a way of establish unified autoamtion api for apps that selenium could interface with?
[2014-09-12 10:26:52] AntonioRibeiro: jimevans: it worked. thanks a lot
[2014-09-12 10:26:53] lb5tr: meaning that it's possible to overcome different architecture patterns with one singe api?
[2014-09-12 10:27:06] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-09-12 10:27:12] lb5tr: *single
[2014-09-12 10:27:18] jimevans: i think that just like the state of web automation, you'll have a "local end", which presents you with an api in your chosen language, and a "remote end" that speaks natively with each local platform.
[2014-09-12 10:27:20] jimevans: here's the thing.
[2014-09-12 10:27:57] jimevans: automating a ui, even a native mobile ui, basically involves navigating a tree of ui elements, finding the one you want, and interacting with it.
[2014-09-12 10:28:19] jimevans: i'm not sure how i see the webdriver UI is lacking in that regard.
[2014-09-12 10:28:41] jimevans: we can (and are in the process of) define common gestures for interacting with mobile UIs.
[2014-09-12 10:28:44] lb5tr: now i get it
[2014-09-12 10:29:10] jimevans: thus the "local" api remains the same.
[2014-09-12 10:29:11] lb5tr: because my problem is (WP) that tree of ui elements is not always visible
[2014-09-12 10:29:28] lb5tr: actaully it's not visible at all
[2014-09-12 10:29:34] jimevans: anything else is a testability problem that you need to bring up with your application developers.
[2014-09-12 10:29:54] jimevans: if it's not visible, how does the user see it to interact with it?
[2014-09-12 10:30:16] lb5tr: in the sense, it is rendered
[2014-09-12 10:30:22] lb5tr: but you don't have any access to it
[2014-09-12 10:30:37] lb5tr: (from the webdriver developer perspective)
[2014-09-12 10:32:02] lb5tr: *xaml files are note 1-to-1 equivalent of runtime ui
[2014-09-12 10:32:03] jimevans: which "webdriver developer perspective"? that phrase is ambiguous. do you mean "one who writes code to drive a UI using webdriver?" or "one who is developing a platform- or browser-specific driver?
[2014-09-12 10:32:06] AutomatedTester: lb5tr: the problem you are having is how that tree is represented and its contents
[2014-09-12 10:32:19] AutomatedTester: the automation framework (webdriver) knows how to speak to that tree
[2014-09-12 10:32:24] lb5tr: one who is developing a platform- or ...
[2014-09-12 10:32:31] AutomatedTester: but it's contents are not the same between platforms
[2014-09-12 10:32:45] lb5tr: AutomatedTester: that is essentialy true
[2014-09-12 10:33:00] AutomatedTester: s/essentially//g
[2014-09-12 10:33:08] lb5tr: :)
[2014-09-12 10:33:23] AutomatedTester: your issue is the UI tree contents
[2014-09-12 10:33:34] AutomatedTester: not the automation frameworks that speak to that tree
[2014-09-12 10:33:43] lb5tr: yeah
[2014-09-12 10:33:45] lb5tr: true
[2014-09-12 10:33:50] lb5tr: i think i learned something right now
[2014-09-12 10:34:16] AutomatedTester: thats what I meant earier... in a browser we can speak to the DOM
[2014-09-12 10:34:39] AutomatedTester: but the attributes will be different depending on what front end MVC framework you use
[2014-09-12 10:34:55] AutomatedTester: Emberjs will not have the same UI tree as AngularJS
[2014-09-12 10:35:06] AutomatedTester: even though they may render the same looking thing
[2014-09-12 10:35:14] lb5tr: and also, with windows phone, you could consider *xaml files as your ui tree, but they are heavily altered on runtime (two-way data biding and stuff, mvvm problems)
[2014-09-12 10:35:27] lb5tr: and now i understand where the problem really is
[2014-09-12 10:35:31] AutomatedTester: exactly
[2014-09-12 10:35:45] AutomatedTester: r.java and your XAML are going to look extremely different
[2014-09-12 10:35:53] AutomatedTester: r.java is for android
[2014-09-12 10:36:22] AutomatedTester: the best thing we can do is go "You tree... got X.y for me?"
[2014-09-12 10:36:36] AutomatedTester: but X.y could be 2 different things depending on the platform
[2014-09-12 10:37:01] lb5tr: i used to like mvvm pattern
[2014-09-12 10:37:30] lb5tr: but when i started to dig into testing/ui testing i see huge problem (unless it's implemented the right way)
[2014-09-12 10:38:39] lb5tr: and with testing in mind
[2014-09-12 10:38:45] lb5tr: ok, thanks guys
